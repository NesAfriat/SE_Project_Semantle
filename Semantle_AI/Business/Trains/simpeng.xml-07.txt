[[Light-emitting diode]]

CATEGORIES: Electronic components

A light-emitting diode (LED) is a semiconductor device that produces light from electricity. LEDs last a long time and do not break easily (compared to incandescent lightbulbs). They can produce many different colors. They are efficient - most of the energy turns into light, not heat. 

An LED is a type of diode that makes one color of light when electricity is sent through it in the expected direction (electrically biased in the forward direction). This effect is a kind of electroluminescence. 

The color of the light depends on the chemical composition of the semiconducting material used, and can be near-ultraviolet, visible or infrared.  The color affects how much electricity is used by the LED.  A white LED has either two or three LEDs inside, of different colors. Some white LEDs have one single-color LED inside (usually blue), combined with a phosphor that converts that single color to white.

LEDs are used in many places. They are the colored indicator lights on many electronic devices, they can be used to make bright advertising signs, brake lights on some newer cars, in TVs, and more recently, light bulbs for the home. White LEDs bright enough to illuminate rooms are usually more expensive than regular lightbulbs but they last longer and burn less electricity.

LEDs, which make their own light, should not be confused with LCDs, which block light. Some displays, however, mix the two technologies, using LEDs to backlight the LCD.

Today, some LEDs are surface-mount devices (SMD), so they can be very small.

He wanted his music to sound typical of his country. The rhythm of Janáček’s music sounds like the rhythm of the dialect he spoke. This was quite close to Polish. Janáček is famous for his operas which are all based on Czech stories. The Cunning Little Vixen is especially charming. It is about animals in a forest (a “vixen” is a female fox).

[[Psychosis]]

CATEGORIES: Psychosis

Psychosis is the name used in psychiatry for a number of conditions. People who suffer from psychosis are said to be psychotic. Usually, psychotic people lose touch with reality, they have trouble telling what is real and what is not. It is an extreme kind of altered state of consciousness.

The word psychosis has two parts. The first part comes from psyche, which means soul in Ancient Greek. The second part is the ending '-osis', which means illness or unnatural condition. So literally, psychosis means unnatural condition of the soul.

People with psychosis may have hallucinations, which means they can experience things that are not really there. They may also have delusions, which are fixed beliefs and ideas that are usually false. Sometimes their personality changes, and they cannot think straight. Some of these thoughts may be paranoid. Not every psychotic person has all of these problems.

Because of these, psychotics often act in strange ways, which also makes it difficult for them to live a normal life as part of  society. They often have trouble with making friends, as most people do not understand them.

Psychosis can affect people to different levels. Some people can continue with mostly normal lives, while other people will need medical help.

About 1 percent of people suffer from psychosis during their lives.April 2009

There are many things that can make someone seem psychotic. These include poisons, drugs, diseases of the nervous system, and other illnesses. For this reason, some people use the image of a fever of the central nervous system to talk about psychosis - a serious illness that may not have a very detailed explanation.

Many people have gone through unusual experiences that they believe are real. Hallucinations connected to religion or paranormal experiences seem to be quite common. Very often, these experiences cannot be called psychosis in a medical sense of the word. For this reason, some people have said that psychosis may simply be an extreme case of something that is experienced by most. People who have suffered from what could be called psychosis may simply have had experiences that were very strong or distressing.

In movies and the media in general, certain people who are shown as violent and antisocial are sometimes labelled psychotic. This image of psychosis is wrong, the people shown are usually psychopaths or sociopaths, they usually do not have hallucinations or delusions.

Psychosis is most associated with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, drug addiction and brain damage but it can be caused by a wide range of conditions.

[[Coral reef]]

CATEGORIES: Biomes, Reefs

A coral reef is a large underwater structure made of dead and living corals. In most healthy reefs, stony corals are predominant. They are built from colonial polyps from the phylum Cnidaria which secrete an exoskeleton of calcium carbonate. The reefs are formed in tropical marine areas (30 degrees north and south of the equator) and between the tropics. The reef acts as the home of many tropical fish and other animals. Coral reefs systems are a major tourism attraction because of their beauty and color of the corals and their many associated animals.

[[Turkish language]]

CATEGORIES: Turkic languages

Turkish (Türkçe) is a language spoken in Turkey, Cyprus, Bulgaria, Greece and other countries of the former Ottoman Empire as well as by several million ethnic Turkish immigrants in Europe.

Turkish is a Turkic language. Like Finnish, Estonian and Hungarian, Turkish uses vowel harmony. Word order is usually subject-object-verb.

Turkish used to be written with the Arabic alphabet from about 900 to 1928. However, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk changed it to the Latin alphabet. The Turkish government justified the move as making Turkish much easier to learn to increase literacy. The literacy rate indeed increased greatly after the reform, from around 10.5% (in 1927) to over 90% (today). However, some say that the move was also to distance the country from the Ottoman Empire, whose documents can no longer be read except by a few scholars.

Turkish is a majority language in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus but it has a distinct dialect. It can be known as Cypriot Turkish.

The Latin alphabet was made to reflect the actual sounds of spoken Turkish, rather than simply transcribing the old Ottoman script into a new form. The Turkish alphabet has 29 letters, seven of which (Ç, Ğ, I, İ, Ö, Ş, and Ü) have been modified from their Latin originals for the phonetic requirements of the language. It represents modern Turkish pronunciation with a high degree of accuracy and specificity. It is the current official alphabet and the latest in a series of distinct alphabets used in different eras.

Turkish is most closely related to other Turkic languages, including Azerbaijani, Turkmen, Uzbek and Kazakh. Another theory is that it is one of the many Altaic languages, which also include Japanese, Mongolian, and Korean.

[[Shanghai Fugu Agreement]]

CATEGORIES: Hesse, Politics of Germany, 1985 in Europe, 1980s in Germany

The Shanghai Fugu Agreement was a successful political prank which was landed on the Social Democrats in the German state of Hesse in 1985.

In 1985 the new Green Party prepared to enter into a German state government for the first time in its history. The first green cabinet minister in German history was going to be Joschka Fischer who later became minister of Foreign Affairs in the German Federal Government under chancellor Gerhard Schroeder. The 1985 Hesse coalition was to be based on an official policy agreement negotiated by both parties.

During a final night session of the negotiations the Greens tabled a demand that Hesse join the "Shanghai Fugu Agreement". This was accepted by their tired Social Democratic counterparts and became official state policy.

The Greens argued that the fugu fish is well known to be a dangerous delicacy requiring specialised chefs who mostly come from Asia.  Due to expanding restrictions on work permits restaurants have found it difficult to employ such specialists. The "Shanghai Fugu Agreement" provides special regulations for certified fugu chefs internationally. 

The agreement was absolutely fictional but was neither discovered to be a joke by the Social Democrats during the nightly negotiations nor later by civil servants or the press who went through the coalition contracts. It took years to be discovered as the joke it was.

[[Rhea Silvia]]

CATEGORIES: Roman mythology

Rhea Silvia is a woman from Roman mythology.  In the legend about the founding of Rome, is the mother of the twin brothers Romulus and Remus. She was the daughter of Numitor Silvius, king of the city Alba Longa.

According to Plutarch, there are many versions of Rhea Silvia's story, and it is not clear which one is real.  But this is one of the best known and most widely accepted: When Numitor's brother Amulius became king by force, he made Rhea Silvia become a Vestal Virgin, so she would not have children who could be kings instead of him. But the god Mars seduced Rhea Silvia and she had the twins Romulus and Remus. For Vestals, the punishment for having sex was death.  So when people found out she was pregnant, Rhea Silvia was buried alive, which was the punishment for a Vestal Virgin who did not remain a virgin. Her sons were thrown into the Tiber by a servant, but were saved by the river god Tiberinus, who also saved Rhea Silvia and later married her.

The Tiber River that flows through Rome gets its name from Tiberinus.  He married Rhea Silvia while the twins, Romulus and Remus, were raised by a she-wolf. When the babies were a few months old, a cowherd found them and raised them. When they were adults, they decided to build a city together.  But they realized only one of them could be its king.  The two men waited on opposite hills for an omen while their followers watched.  At first, six vultures landed on the hill where Remus was waiting.  The followers believed this would mean the city would last for six hundred years.   But then twelve vultures landed on Romulus' hill and they named the city after him instead.  Shortly afterword, Remus made fun of the city wall Romulus was building.  Either one of Romulus' friends or Romulus himself hit Remus, and he died. The city was named after Romulus, Rome.

[[Virginity]]

CATEGORIES: Sexuality

Virginity means a state of purity or inexperience. Traditionally a virgin is a person that has not had sexual intercourse. Virginity has different meanings and importance in different religions and cultures.

Virgin women do not need to have an unbroken hymen. A hymen is a human tissue that partially blocks the opening of the vagina about two inches deep. When a man inserts his penis or other object(s) are inserted into the vagina, it can tear or break the hymen which may result in bleeding. This blood from the hymen is important in many cultures, as it is a sign that the woman is a virgin; even though it is not necessary for the hymen to be broken to signify a woman's lack of virginity. The hymen can also, however, be worn away naturally by riding a horse, playing sports, or other recreational activities; it can also heal over time just like torn human tissue can.

It is possible for a virgin to have a sexually transmitted disease, which was acquired by some other means: such as drug use, blood or plasma transfusions, close skin contact in the pubic area with infected people, oral sex, and other means.

In several polytheistic religions (religions with many gods), priestesses of certain gods have to be virgins, one notable exception is the Sumerian goddess Fauk'Stek, who was believed to have impregnated the sun god Loki and to have 'taught the Earth and its sons the glory of sacrifice'. In many cultures it is said that women should be virgins until marriage. In some cultures, women who are not virgins until marriage are ostracized or murdered.

He tells Polyphemos that his name is "Nobody", and gives him wine to drink. When he is sleeping, Odysseus and his men take a log from the fire and shape the end of it to a point and drive it into the Kyklops', Polyphemos, only eye, so he could not see them anymore.  In agony he cries out to the other Kyklopes for help.  When they ask what has happened, he says that "Nobody" hurt him, so the Kyklopes leave him.  The next morning Polyphemos lets his sheep out of the cave, but touches their backs so no one of the men could ride out on them. But Odysseus and his men hold themselves on the underside of the sheep, and so they get out. When Polyphemos realizes that Odysseus got away, he cries out to the other Kyklopes again. They asked him what happened, and he said "Nobody hurt me.", and so the other Kyklopes went away again. When Odysseus was on his ship again, he called out in rage to Polyphemos saying that he, Odysseus was the one who had destroyed his eye. As Odysseus went away he mocked Polyphemos. This is hubris. Polyphemos was very angry and threw a rock at them, but it missed the ship. Then he pled with his father, Poseidon, for revenge that all of Odysseus' men should die and that Odysseus should only come home to Ithaca after ten years. All of it comes true, as is told in the Odyssey.

[[Dialects of English]]

CATEGORIES: Dialects of English

There are several dialects of English used in different parts of the world.

[[Music theory]]

CATEGORIES: Music theory

Theory of Music is all about trying to understand how existing music works and how new music could or should be organized. Someone who makes a special study of music theory is a music theorist.

People who make their own music are composers. People who play or sing music are “performers”. It is important for both composers and performers to understand what makes the music sound the way it does. In the times of the Ancient Greeks the famous philosopher Pythagoras tried to explain how instruments are tuned. He understood the science of the good vibrations that the instruments make and explained how and why the octave is divided into twelve parts(in some cultures).

In the Middle Ages there were several famous music theorists who wrote books about music theory. Their ideas are interesting for us because they tell us what people thought about music at that time.

In the 18th century some composers wrote books on music theory. Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach (son of the famous Johann Sebastian Bach) wrote a book called: “An Essay on the true art of playing the Keyboard”. Leopold Mozart (the father of the famous Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart) wrote a book called The Art of Playing the Violin. Both these books were extremely well known in their day. In spite of their titles the first halves of these two books are both about a branch of music theory called "performance practice": They tell us a lot about how music was played in those days, how some rhythms were played quite freely and how ornaments in the music were played.

Today people who want to compose will study music theory, perhaps at college or university school of music.  In a conservatory program, they study harmony and counterpoint as well as form; in other programs, they spend less time on the theories of the past. They will be taught “rules”. These rules are not laws, they simply mean: the way that most great composers wrote music in the past. These rules describe what composers of the past did, rather than telling composers of today what to do -- in fact, music composed today can have completely different rules than the music of the past. 

Music theory is important for people who perform music because all these things help people to understand the music they are playing.

[[Ayurveda]]

CATEGORIES: Indian culture, Pseudoscience

Ayurveda (ˌ) is an alternative medicine system from the Indian subcontinent. Ayurveda is scientific. The Indian Medical Association (IMA) says the practice of modern medicine by Ayurveda is quackery. Ayurvedic texts say that the gods of Hindu mythology gave medical knowledge to legendary Hindu philosophers, who then gave the knowledge to human physicians. The word "ayurveda" is from the आयुर्वेद, Āyurveda, and means knowledge of life and longevity. 

In Ayurveda, the story is that Dhanvantari, the Hindu god of Ayurveda, made himself into a human king by incarnation. He was king of Varanasi, and taught Ayurvedic medicine to a group of physicians. One of these physicians, named Sushruta, wrote the Sushruta Samhita (Sushruta's Compendium), an Ayurvedic text that has this story in it. 

Most Ayurvedic therapies are made from chemical compounds taken from plants, from minerals, and from metals. In ancient India, Ayurvedic texts gave explanations for surgeries and for the stitching of wounds to help wound healing. The ancient Indians knew how to take out kidney stones and how to do rhinoplasty (plastic surgery for the nose). People have used many different Ayurvedic therapies through the history of India. Ayurveda has changed for more than two thousand years. In the 1970s and 1980s, Ayurveda also changed for consumption in the Western world.

Some people say Ayurveda comes from Prehistory. Some ideas in Ayurveda may have been in existence at the time of the Indus Valley civilization, during the Bronze Age in India. During the Vedic period, Ayurveda went through many developments. Outside the tradition of the Vedas, Buddhism and Jainism also shared some ideas with the Ayurvedic texts from ancient India. By around two thousand years ago, Ayurveda had developed some of its ideas for surgery and drugs.

There is no good evidence that works or helps for any disease. Some Ayurvedic products have lead, mercury, and arsenic in them. In 2008, nearly 21% of Ayurvedic products sold on the internet and made in India and the United States had in them lead, mercury, and arsenic (heavy metals) in quantities that are toxic. There may be public health dangers that result from this, but that is not known.

[[Electronic music]]

CATEGORIES: Electronic music

Electronic music is music which is made with electronic equipment such as synthesizers or computers. Sometimes electronic music artists create special sounds using tape recorders too.

After World War II, when tape recorders had been invented and were becoming popular, composers started to use them to make music.  The tape recorder was needed for the performance.  Composers used them to combine lots of different sounds.  Sometimes it was music played on ordinary (acoustic) instruments which was then changed in some way by the tape recorder.  Sometimes they took sounds from everyday life such as the sound of water, traffic noise or bird song.  All these noises were put together in the way the composer wanted by using the tape recorder.  Tapes of sounds were often cut into pieces, then the pieces were 'spliced' – put back together in a different order. The results were often very interesting, but there were problems.  Some people asked: “Is it music?”  Others thought it was boring to just look at a tape recorder during a concert instead of being able to watch live musicians play.

Composers in Paris were experimenting with electronic music in the 1940s.  They called it “Musique concrète” because they used natural, concrete sounds. (“Concrete” in this sense meant the opposite of “abstract” music which was written down for performance).  The sounds were played back at different speeds, combined in lots of ways, played backwards or played continuously (repeated in a 'loop'), or played into a mixer and re-recorded onto another tape recorder.  The sounds could be filtered. Effects such as vibrato or echo could be added.  Sometimes composers used synthesizers which were machines that could make electronic music in real time.  They sounded more like normal instruments than the sound effects on a tape recorder.

Computers have often been used for composing electronic music. 

[[Reggae]]

Reggae is a music genre that began in Jamaica in the late 1960s. Most music from Jamaica comes from the reggae style.

The music has regular chops on the back beat (off-beat).  These are called “skank”, and are played by a rhythm guitarist.  The bass drum hits on the second and fourth beat of each measure (each bar). These are called the “drop”. Reggae bands also use a bass, a keyboard or organ, and horns.

Reggae music is often used by Rastafarian groups. They are usually songs about religion, love and social problems. Bob Marley (1945-1981) was a famous reggae artist.

Famous instruments in reggae music are drums, guitar, saxophone, trumpet and trombone.

[[Bebop]]

CATEGORIES: African-American history, Jazz music

Bebop or bop is a kind of jazz that became popular near the beginning of the Second World War, in the mid-1940s. Bebop is often fast.  The musicians improvise using a small group of chords which are repeated again and again. Charlie Parker (1920-1955), who was  famous for his saxophone playing, was a bebop artist. The famous trumpet player Dizzy Gillespie (1917-1993) was also a renowned artist of this genre.

The term "bebop" originates from a group of syllables used in scat singing, where random strings of sound were used in place of words.

[[Magnetic resonance imaging]]

CATEGORIES: Medical procedures, Medical imaging

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI), are techniques that doctors use to give a visual representation of soft tissue (flesh) inside the body. Magnetic resonance uses nuclear magnetic resonance to generate these images.

To take an MRI image, the patient lies on a movable bed. The bed enters a strong magnetic field and then radio waves are applied for a short time in a different direction. This sudden shift causes certain atoms in the patient's body to make special signals. The MRI scanner detects those special signals.

The MRI scanner then sends the signal information to a computer, and the computer creates an image of the inner body by using the signal information.

[[Refugee camp]]

CATEGORIES: Forced migration, War

When there is a war or some other armed conflict in a country, many people will try to flee (run away) from that country. They will go to other countries, around the country where there is no war. Because they fled, they are called refugees.

If there are just a few refugees coming into a country it is generally no problem to get housing for them somewhere. However, if there are many (or if the government of a country expects many) refugees, it may build what is called a refugee camp. This is usually done by putting many tents, and a few toilets and showers on an unused plot (stretch) of land. This is usually land where no one wants to live.

Usually the governments hope that conflicts get resolved soon, and that those camps are only temporary.

This has not been the case for the refugee camps in the Gaza Strip, for example. Those camps have existed since the mid 1970s.

[[Rubber]]

The 2003 invasion of Iraq (March 20, 2003 - May 1, 2003) was the war fought by the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Poland and some other countries against Iraq, to end the rule of Saddam Hussein. The main reason that the war started was said to be because the British and American Governments believed that Iraq had dangerous weapons of mass destruction (such as chemical or nuclear weapons) that could be used against other countries. This turned out after the invasion to not be true.

Another reason for the start of the war was that many people thought that Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, one of the leaders of al-Qaeda, was hiding in Iraq after the September 11, 2001 attacks. Though Saddam Hussein was not involved in the planning of the September 11 attacks, many people accused him of giving al-Qaeda a safe place to hide from the United States. The war was extremely controversial. Many British and American people blamed British Prime Minister Tony Blair and the American President, George W. Bush.

Paratroopers landed in the far north of Iraq and a few soldiers attacked from the sea, but most invaded from Kuwait in the south. 4,734 NATO soldiers were killed in Iraq war including 4,600 U.S. servicemen, 179 UK servicemen and 139 Other NATO soldiers with a total of 4900 casualties. 31,882 U.S. servicemen and over 3,600 UK servicemen were wounded in Iraq.

[[Ramayana]]

CATEGORIES: Hinduism, Hindu texts

The Ramayana is an ancient Sanskrit epic about Rama and Sita. It is one of the two most important ancient epics of India, the first one being the ancient Mahabharata. The epic was originally written by sage (rishi) Valmiki of Ancient India. The book has about 24,000 verses and is divided into seven parts.

The story of the Ramayana is about Prince Rama who has been exiled from his kingdom of Ayodhya. He goes on to kill king Ravana of Lanka in a long battle to get back his wife Sita.

7 Different versions of the book are available. It has been translated into all the major languages of the world. 

The different parts of the Ramayana are also called books. These seven parts or books are noted below:

There are different views about the time the Ramayana was written. Some people believe that it was written 2,500 years ago. Others think that it was written around 1,800 years ago. All agree that the book is very old and was written before the Mahabharata.

The Ramayana is still very popular today. Every autumn the Ramlila (Rama play) is performed at the festival of Dassehra. A huge model of Ravana is set alight. This symbolizes the triumph of light over darkness. It is also believed that he turned in to Krishna and also many more things are believed.

A Tamil version of the book was written between the 9th and 10th centuries. The writer of this book was Kamban. This version is known as Iramavataram, which means coming of Rama. In the 16th century, Tulasidas wrote a Hindi version of Ramayana. This was named Ramacharitmanasa. Over many centuries, the story of Rama reached places in other countries like Indonesia and Malaysia. The Ramayana has been translated into most of the major languages of the world.

The Ramayana was used in Ancient India for the teaching of young children. It was mainly used for acting out their religious beliefs so that their children knew that they were to worship the main Hindu beliefs that were: Brahman, Multiples Gods, Dharma, Samsara, and Karma.

[[Mahabharata]]

CATEGORIES: Mahabharata, Hinduism, Hindu texts, National symbols of India

The ''Mahabharata, that is, the great Bharata, is one of the two most important ancient epics of India, the other being the Ramayana. The Mahabharata was compiled in Ancient India. One of the rishis (Indian sages) named Vyasa is believed to have composed the work. The legend states that God Ganesha wrote the Mahabharata while Vyasa dictated the same in the city of Rourkela in Odisha State. It is possibly one of the longest work of its kind in the world. The epic contains about 110,000 shloka (couplets) in eighteen sections. These sections deal with a number of topics such as a number of aspects of Hinduism, Hindu mythology, ethics, and the Hindu way of life. There is also a nineteenth section named Harivamsha. The Bhagavadgita, a dialogue between Krishna and Arjuna, is a part of the Mahabharata''.

Sage Vyasa taught this epic to his son Suka and his students Vaisampayana and others. King Janamejaya, the son of Parikshit and grandson of the heroes of the epic, performed a great sacrifice (yajna). The epic was retold by Vaisampayana to Janamejaya at the advice of Vyasa. Later on, the other sage Suta retold the Mahabharata similar to Vaisampayana to Janamejaya, to Saunaka and others, during a sacrifice performed by Saunaka in Naimisaranya, which is near Sitapur in Uttar Pradesh.

Noted below are few words about the eighteen sections of the Mahabharata. In Mahabharata, these sections are called parvan. A parvan means a book. The names of all parvas or books of the Mahabharata are noted below.

[[Hajj]]

CATEGORIES: Islam, Mecca, Religion in Saudi Arabia, Worship

The Hajj (h; حج ar "pilgrimage") is an annual Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca, the most holy city of the Muslims, and a Fard or mandatory religious duty for Muslims that must be carried out at least once in their lifetime by all adult Muslims who are physically and financially capable of undertaking the journey, and can support their family during their absence. It is one of the five pillars of Islam, alongside Shahadah, Salat, Zakat, and Sawm. The Hajj is the largest annual gathering of people in the world. The state of being physically and financially capable of performing the Hajj is called istita'ah, and a Muslim who fulfills this condition is called a mustati. The Hajj is a demonstration of the solidarity of the Muslim people, and their submission to God (Allah). The word Hajj means "to intend a journey", which connotes both the outward act of a journey and the inward act of intentions.

The pilgrimage occurs from the 8th to 12th (or in some cases 13th) of Dhu al-Hijjah, the last month of the Islamic calendar. Because the Islamic calendar is lunar and the Islamic year is about eleven days shorter than the Gregorian year, the Gregorian date of Hajj changes from year to year. Ihram is the name given to the special spiritual state in which pilgrims wear two white sheets of seamless cloth and abstain from certain actions.

The Hajj is associated with the life of Islamic prophet Muhammad from the 7th century, but the ritual of pilgrimage to Mecca is considered by Muslims to stretch back thousands of years to the time of Abraham. During Hajj, pilgrims join processions of hundreds of thousands of people, who simultaneously converge on Mecca for the week of the Hajj, and perform a series of rituals: each person walks counter-clockwise seven times around the Ka'aba (the cube-shaped building and the direction of prayer for the Muslims), runs back and forth between the hills of Al-Safa and Al-Marwah, drinks from the Zamzam Well, goes to the plains of Mount Arafat to stand in vigil, spends a night in the plain of Muzdalifa, and performs symbolic stoning of the devil by throwing stones at three pillars. The pilgrims then shave their heads, perform a ritual of animal sacrifice, and celebrate the three-day global festival of Eid al-Adha.

Pilgrims can also go to Mecca to perform the rituals at other times of the year. This is sometimes called the "lesser pilgrimage", or Umrah. However, even if they choose to perform the Umrah, they are still obligated to perform the Hajj at some other point in their lifetime if they have the means to do so, because Umrah is not a substitute for Hajj.

At the centre, there was a struggle between King Charles I and the Parliament of England over how England should be ruled. The King wanted to rule without Parliament telling him what to do. At first Parliament wanted to reduce the King's power, but later it decided that the country did not need a king. King Charles's supporters were known as the Royalists, and were nicknamed "Cavaliers". Parliament's supporters were known as the Parliamentarians, and were nicknamed "Roundheads".

From 1639 to 1653, there was fighting in England, Scotland and Ireland, three separate countries that were ruled by the same king. The fighting that took place in each of these countries broke out at different times and for different reasons. In England, it lasted from 1642 to 1651. Some people think of this as one big war, while others think of it as three separate wars: the First English Civil War (1642-46), the Second English Civil War (1648) and the Third English Civil War (1649-51). The wars are also sometimes known as the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, including the Bishops' Wars in Scotland in 1639 to 1640 and the Irish Rebellion from 1641 to 1653.

The Parliamentarians won the war. Charles I was captured, put on trial and in 1649 he was executed. His son Charles II then tried to take over the country, but lost and escaped abroad. As a result, the three kingdoms spent 11 years without a king. For most of this time, they were run by Oliver Cromwell, a former Parliamentarian general. After Cromwell's death, the monarchy was restored under Charles II. However, kings were never as powerful as they had been before the war.

[[Cowpox]]

CATEGORIES: Diseases caused by viruses, Animal diseases

Cowpox is a disease. This disease affects the skin. It is caused by a virus (Cowpox virus) that is related to the Vaccinia virus. People (or animals) who have the disease have red blisters. The disease can be spread by touch from cows to humans. The virus that causes cowpox was used to perform the first successful vaccination against another disease. The disease vaccinated against was the deadly smallpox. Smallpox is caused by the related variola virus. Therefore, the word "vaccination" has the Latin root vaca meaning cow.

In 1798, the English physician Edward Jenner made a curious observation. Jenner lived in the countryside, not in the city. 

Some of his patients had gotten cowpox, and recovered from it. He observed that those patients did not get the disease again, they seemed to be immune against it. What was more, they also seemed to be immune against smallpox. Smallpox was a deadly disease then, that killed most of the people it infected. So he used the fluid he got from cowpox lesions, and scratched it into healthy people. That way, he could make those people immune against smallpox.

The Cowpox (Catpox) virus is found in Europe and mainly in the UK.  Human cases are very rare and most often contracted from domestic cats.  The virus is not commonly found in cows; the reservoir hosts for the virus are woodland rodents particularly voles.  It is from these rodents that domestic cats get the virus.  Symptoms in cats include lesions on the face, neck, forelimbs, and paws, and less commonly upper respiratory tract infection.  Symptoms of infection with cowpox virus in humans are localized, pustular lesions generally found on the hands and limited to the site of introduction.  The incubation period (the time between an infection and the first signs of the disease) is 9–10 days.  The virus can be found mostly in late summer and autumn.

[[Chickenpox]]

CATEGORIES: Diseases caused by viruses

Chickenpox, also known as chicken pox, is a disease. Usually, it is children who get the disease, but adults can also get it.  People who have it get blisters or spots, mostly on the body and in the face. Those blisters are filled with a liquid. At some point, the blisters will drain, and the person will want to scratch them. Burst blisters usually become healthy without leaving scars, unless they become infected.  The symptoms come in two or three waves, and they usually include fever. If there are no complications, the disease will last between three and five days in children. Chickenpox is very common and by the age 14, more than 90% of children will have had the disease. 

Getting chickenpox during a pregnancy is dangerous, as it can hurt both the mother and the child. 

Chickenpox is caused by a virus of the herpes family. People who had chickenpox in the past can also get a related disease called shingles later.  Shingles are caused by the same virus but usually is only one part of the body.

There is a vaccine against chickenpox. Usually, the vaccine is given to children if they did not have the disease before the start of puberty, that is aged 9–13 years old. Sometimes to help your child not to scratch when they have chicken pox, you can get a special cream for it such as e45.

[[Tonality]]

CATEGORIES: Music theory

Music has tonality if it uses the notes of a major or minor scale. Such music is tonal. It is in a particular "key". Nearly all Western music is tonal.

All tonal music is based on a major or minor scale. If the tune “Twinkle, twinkle little star” is played starting on the note C, the notes of a C major scale will be used. The note C will sound like the home note (the “tonic”) and, indeed, the tune finishes on a C. The tune could have started on any other note (C sharp, D, E flat, E etc.) but a knowledge of scales would be needed as some sharps or flats (black notes) will be required. When singing the tune there is no need to think about the sharps and flats: the singer does them quite naturally.

A piece of tonal music will usually modulate after a while. This means that it changes key. But the music will not sound finished until it goes back to the original key. If one sings The Star-Spangled Banner and stops after the words “our flag was still there” the song sounds as if it has stopped in mid-air. It will not sound finished until it goes back to the first key in the last two lines.

Most Western music from about 1600 onwards is based in a major or minor key. This system of tonality was used by all the great composers up to the 20th century and in popular music and most folk music. Listening to a symphony by Beethoven is like going on a journey through various key areas, always returning to the original tonic at the end. In some cases, such as Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony, it may start in the minor and finish in the major. This is because minor keys can sound disturbed, full of tension, but major keys sound happier and more relaxed.

The opposite of “tonality” is atonality. An atonal piece is one where there is no feeling of a home key. Playing lots of random notes will sound atonal. Schoenberg was one of the most famous composers of atonal music. Of course, his music is not just random notes (although it may sound like it to the listener at first), so he had to find another way of giving his music shape. That is why he invented the twelve-tone system.

[[Toucan]]

CATEGORIES: Piciformes

The toucan is a South American bird in the family Ramphastidae. This social bird lives in small flocks in lowland rainforests in countries such as Costa Rica. It flies short distances between trees. Toucans rest in holes in trees. They mostly eat fruit, but sometimes they also eat insects and small lizards.

They are brightly marked and have large, often-colorful bills. The family includes five genera and over forty different species.

Toucans are resident breeders and do not migrate. Toucans are usually found in pairs or small flocks. They sometimes fence with their bills and wrestle, which scientists think is to find out who is the top bird amongst them. 

[[Elbow]]

CATEGORIES: Joints

The elbow is a hinge-joint between the bones of the upper and lower arm. It joins the humerus of the upper arm and the radius and ulna of the forearm together. Everyone has 2 elbows. It allows the lower arm to be extended or retracted (moved in). The elbow also allows the arm to turn. It moves by using three ligaments: the anterior, posterior, ulnar collateral and radial collateral ligaments.

[[Wrist]]

CATEGORIES: Joints

The wrist is the joint that links together the lower arm and the hand.

[[Knee]]

CATEGORIES: Basic English 850 words, Joints

The knee is the joint that links 4 of the upper and lower bones of the leg, which are called the femur, tibia, fibula and the patella. The knee joint is the largest joint in the body and is an extensive network of ligaments and muscles. Basically, it is a hinge which allows movement of the lower leg in only one direction. The lower leg (tibia+fibula+foot) can swing back from the knee, and that is all.

The knee is held together by ligaments which connect the bones and produces fluid which lubricates the movement at the joint. The meniscus is a cartilage 

that lies on the inner and outer edges of the upper surface of the tibia. These are the shock

absorbers of the knee and supply proper weight distribution.

[[Atomic theory]]

CATEGORIES: Nuclear physics, Chemistry

In chemistry and physics, the atomic theory explains how our understanding of the atom has changed over time. Atoms were once thought to be the smallest pieces of matter. However, it is now known that atoms are made up of protons, neutrons, and electrons. These subatomic particles are made up of quarks. The first idea of the atom came from the Greek philosopher Democritus. A lot of the ideas in the modern theory came from John Dalton, a British chemist and physicist.

The theory applies to solids, liquids and gases, but it does not apply in way analogous to plasmas or neutron stars.

[[Particle physics]]

CATEGORIES: Subatomic particles

Particle physics is a category of physics that studies really tiny pieces of things, known as particles. These particles are the really small pieces that build up the world around us. They are best described in the language of math: calculus, the imaginary number, and group theory (which describes symmetry).

Stravinsky wrote music in different styles. At first he wrote music similar to his teacher Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov. He loved his native Russian music. He wrote music which had very complicated chords and rhythms. It is lively music, and some of his best known works of this kind were written for the Ballets Russes of Sergei Diaghilev: The Firebird, Petrushka, The Rite of Spring, Les noces, Pulcinella and Apollo musagète. They were written from 1910 to 1928.

[[Technological singularity]]

CATEGORIES: Technology

The technological singularity is the idea that a machine or computer, or a group of machines and computers, will one day be smarter than humans.

Because it has not happened yet, nobody really knows what the technological singularity will do, or if it will even happen. Nonetheless, the technological singularity has been a subject in many science fiction works, such as The Terminator, The Matrix, and the Borg in Star Trek. In most depictions of the singularity, machines have consciousness and humans are considered to be useless. The futurist (who studies about the future) and inventor Ray Kurzweil believes the Singularity will happen about the year 2045.  The major impetus driving toward the singularity, according to Kurzweil, is that according to Moore's Law, computers are doubling in memory capacity every 18 months. According to Kurzweil, by 2029, computers will be as intelligent as human beings (see artificial intelligence).

[[Moment of silence]]

CATEGORIES: Relationships, Religious behavior and experience, Education

There is also a video game The Moment of Silence, and a poem "Moment of Silence".

A moment of silence is a short time when people do not make noise. A moment of silence shows respect for people who have died. Many countries observe a minute of silence after a tragic event. Moments of silence often last one minute, but other amounts of time may be chosen.

On November 11th, many countries observe a two-minute silence to remember those who have died in World Wars. The tradition was started in 1919 exactly one year after the end of World War I. It became an official part of the annual service on Remembrance Day or Armistice Day.

During the moment of silence, people often bow their heads, remove their hats, and do not speak or move. A person in charge of a group will tell everyone when the moment begins and ends. A moment of silence may come before or after other events with symbolic meaning. Examples of these events are the ringing of bells, the release of doves or balloons, or a bugle playing the "Last Post".

Gregor Johann Mendel (Heinzendorf, Austria, 20 July 1822 – Brünn, Austro-Hungary, 6 January 1884) was an Austrian monk and botanist.

Mendel founded genetics by his work cross-breeding pea plants. He discovered dominant and recessive characters (genes) from the crosses he performed on the plants in his greenhouse. What he learnt is known today as Mendelian inheritance.

His work was not appreciated at first, but was 'rediscovered' in 1900 by  Carl Correns and Hugo de Vries. Erich von Tschermak's status as a third rediscoverer is now less convincing.

[[Briefs]]

CATEGORIES: Underwear

Briefs are a type of short underwear for males or females. They provide a close fit, and come in either white, or in other colors like blue, pink, or red.

For male briefs, before 2000s, briefs often came with hard elastic waistband. This would cause stretch marks, and this was eventually replaced by the soft elastic waistband. However, hard elastic waistbands are still found on generic store brand underwear (that save consumer and manufacturing costs by not being fashion forward).

Female briefs are also called knickers or panties.

[[Kayastha]]

CATEGORIES: Indian people, Ethnic groups in Asia

Kayastha (also referred to as Kayasth or Kayeth) is an ancient community. Kayastha word is very often seen in Tripitaka the Buddha's verses where this is used for the deep jhani's (meditator). It comes in the famous Buddha's discourse given in "Satipatthana Sutt"  where the Gotama the Samma Sambuddha explained about the four types of mindfullness. 

Kaye kayanupassi viharati  atapi sampjano satima vinniyeloke abhijjadomanassan. (Here a monk dwells ardent with awareness and constant thorough understanding of impermanence observing Body in Body (Hindi: काया के भीतर स्थित (कायस्थ) होकर जो अविद्या को दुर कर्ता है). Kayastha are the person instead of community in itself who are mindfull with the self that is dwell in his "Kaya" where one can sees the truth within. and experience  insight. the real knowledge the truth actually exist inside the body (Kaya). Later on when all the beings living in "Jambudeepa" which was now evolve to the vast states  as "Maha janapada".were specially known in four specific sects like Brahmin (Bamana), kkhattiya, (kshatriye), vanijo (vaishye) and Sudra. There was a time when people were known with samana,bamana and grahasta. Samana who live in forest to find the ultimate truth. Brahmana also search for the ultimate truth but believed that ultimate knowledge can only be attained by Brahmins. But samana were not agree with this theory of attaining ultimate knowledge only by certain sect of the society.

One mythological character "Chitragupta" were also known with the four-father Kayastha community of North India, Chandraseniya (CKP) of Maharashtra and Bengali Kayastha of Bengal. As per the 1779 AD letter of council of Pandits of Benaras to the Brahmin Peshwa Darbar regarding varna status of various Kayastha subgroups, the Chitraguptavanshi Kayastha are Brahmins (Kayastha Brahmin/ Brahma Kayastha) while the CKP are Kshatriya.

During Mughal Era Kayasthas are considered to be members of the writer caste, and have traditionally acted as keepers of public records and accounts, writers, and administrators of the state.Ancient times Kayasthas were the most powerful rulers of ancient India.In modern times, Kayasthas have attained success in politics, as well as in the arts and various professional fields.

[[String quartet]]

CATEGORIES: Musical forms, String quartets

A string quartet is a piece of music for four string instruments.

A string quartet can also mean the four people who play a piece for four string instruments.

The four instruments in a string quartet are almost always 2 violins, 1 viola and 1 cello. The reason that a double bass is not used is that it would sound too loud and heavy. The balance between 2 violins, viola and cello is considered ideal.

String quartets are the most popular form of chamber music. Many composers have written string quartets.

String quartet writing started in the 18th century. Italian composers like Sammartini (1698-1775) wrote music for two violins, viola and continuo. The continuo was either just a harpsichord or harpsichord with cello. Gradually composers started to leave the harpsichord out. The cello often played the same as the viola but one octave lower. 

Composers of the Classical music period started writing cello parts which had an identity of their own. Joseph Haydn (1732-1809) wrote many string quartets, making it a very popular form. His quartets from op.33 were, he said, “written in a new and special way”. All four parts were very clear and individual. There were always four movements: a fast movement, a slow one, a Minuet and Trio and a fast Finale. Haydn often played in a quartet with Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756-1791) and two other players. Mozart also wrote many string quartets and dedicated some of them to Haydn. Three of Mozart’s later ones were written for the King of Prussia who played the cello well, so Mozart gave the cello lots of difficult music to play.

By the time Ludwig van Beethoven (1770-1827) was growing up, string quartets treated each of the four instruments as important. Beethoven wrote 16 string quartets. The middle ones became particularly famous and later composers took ideas from them, for example the slow introductions, and the idea of having a fast scherzo instead of a minuet and trio for one of the middle movements. Beethoven’s last quartets are very beautiful, but also very complicated and sometimes quite aggressive. Beethoven was becoming very frustrated because he was deaf and could not hear his own music, but he could imagine it all in his head. Franz Schubert (1797-1827) admired them and wrote several string quartets himself.

In the Romantic period many composers wrote string quartets: Felix Mendelssohn (1809-1847), Robert Schumann (1810-1856), Johannes Brahms (1833-1897), Pyotr Tchaikovsky (1840-1893), Antonín Dvořák (1841-1904) and many others. Some of them, like Dvořák, included folk song from their own country in their quartets.

In the 20th century, composers have continued to write string quartets. Claude Debussy (1862-1918) and Maurice Ravel (1875-1934) each wrote one. Arnold Schoenberg even added a voice to his first String Quartet. Béla Bartók (1881-1945) wrote six string quartets which are very hard to play. They have very exciting rhythms which often come from his native Hungarian folk music, as well as complex harmonies. Dmitri Shostakovich (1906-1975) wrote fifteen and Benjamin Britten (1913-1976) wrote three.

[[Opus number]]

CATEGORIES: Musical terminology

Opus or the shortened form op.  after the title of a piece of music means “work”.  It is followed by a number.  When a composer writes their first piece of music it is followed by the term “opus 1”.  The next composition would then be called “opus 2”, etc.

Giving pieces of music opus numbers helps us to identify which piece of music (from a certain composer) that composition is.  For example: Beethoven wrote lots of piano sonatas. His first Piano sonata in A flat major has the opus number of op.26. This shows that he wrote this sonata when he was young in his composing career.  Many years later, he wrote another piano sonata which is also in A flat major, and this piece one has the opus number of 110 (op. 110).

You cannot always tell from a composer’s opus numbers the order in which the works were composed.  Until around the end of the 18th century, opus numbers were only given to pieces of music which were published.

Some musicologists (people who study and write about music) have studied all the works by a famous composer and have given them a catalogue number.  For example Mozart’s music does not have opus numbers.  Some of them are long operas, others are tiny little pieces for the piano he might have written in a hurry one day.  A man called Köchel made a list of every single work by Mozart and gave them K numbers (K for Köchel). His numbering goes up to 622.  This is useful, for example, to tell the difference between his Symphony in G minor K183 and his Symphony in G minor K550.

The plural of “opus” is “opuses” in English.  This is because the Latin plural is opera which is rather confusing to English speakers as the word is already used in musical terminology. 

The word "opus" can also refer to the "work" of an artist. (For example: "This opus was composed by Chopin," or "This opus is the last Piano sonata that Beethoven composed")

An artist's "magnum opus" means his or her "greatest" work.

[[Amino acid]]

CATEGORIES: Amino acids

Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins. In eukaryotes, there are 20 standard amino acids out of which almost all proteins are made.

In biochemistry, an amino acid is any molecule that has both amine (NH2+R) and carboxyl (C=O) functional groups. In biochemistry, this term refers to alpha-amino acids with the general formula H2NCHRCOOH, where R is one of many side groups (see diagram). 

About 500 amino acids are known. For animals, the most important thing that amino acids do is to make proteins, which are very long chains of amino acids. Every protein has its own sequence of amino acids, and that sequence makes the protein take different shapes, and have different functions. Amino acids are like the alphabet for proteins; even though you only have a few letters, if you connect them, you can make many different sentences.

Nine of the 20 standard amino acids are "essential" amino acids for humans. They cannot be built (synthesised) from other compounds by the human body, and so must be taken in as food. Others may be essential for some ages or medical conditions. Essential amino acids may also differ between species. Herbivores have to get their essential amino acids from their diet, which for some is almost entirely grass. Ruminants such as cows get some amino acids via microbes in the first two stomach chambers.

[[Miscarriage]]

CATEGORIES: Abortion

A miscarriage is the natural death of an embryo or fetus in the womb, before it is old enough to live on its own, outside the mother.  The medical words for a miscarriage are spontaneous abortion.  ("Spontaneous" means something that a person did not expect to happen.  An "abortion" is when a pregnancy ends early, before birth.)

Among women who know they are pregnant, about 15-20% have miscarriages.  (This means that up to 1 in every 5 women who know they are pregnant miscarries.) It is the most common complication (serious problem) that happens in early pregnancy in humans.

[[Yuan dynasty]]

CATEGORIES: Chinese dynasties, 1271 establishments, 1368 disestablishments, 13th-century establishments in Asia, 14th century disestablishments in Asia

The Yuan dynasty was a Mongol dynasty that ruled Mongolia and China from 1271 to 1368. Before this dynasty, China was ruled by the Song dynasty. After the Yuan dynasty, the Ming dynasty ruled China. Genghis Khan and his army of Mongols conquered many parts of China. His grandson Kublai Khan added more parts of China to his kingdom. He founded the Yuan dynasty in 1271.

In the year of 1206, Genghis Khan ruled the Mobi tribes(a part of a country)  to establish the Mongol country at the Onon River. Jin was the main race in Mongolia, but Jin and Xia were in decline, Mongolia had attacked the Western Xia and Jin in August 1227, and Jin lost, so Mongolia occupied the whole north of China in March 1234.   

In 1259, Möngke Khan died after the Song Yuan dynasty war. His brothers all wanted to be king. His fourth brother, Kublai, and his seventh brother, Ali Khan, fought to rule the Mobi tribes. And finally in 1264, Kublai won. Kublai made the name "DaYuan" in 1271 and proclaimed the Yuan Dynasty and said its founder was his grandfather Genghis. In 1276, Yuan ruled southern of Song, so yuan ruled the whole China in this year. In 1279, the Kublai subdued southern Song dynasty. The Yuan dynasty ruled China and brought different parts of China together that had been split since the late Tang dynasty. They were the first foreign dynasty to rule just about all of China. 

For centuries, most of what the West knew about China came from the book by Marco Polo about his visit to Kublai's empire. The Yuan dynasty  ended in 1368 when the Ming dynasty took control.

Life and Times of Michael K is a novel written by J. M. Coetzee in 1983. It won a Booker Prize.

The story is about a simple gardener called Michael K, trying to run away from South Africa in the Apartheid Era.

Some people think there is a link between Michael K and Josef K. in The Trial by Franz Kafka.

[[Tort]]

CATEGORIES: Legal terms

Tort law is the part of law for most harms that are not either criminal or based on a contract.  Tort law helps people to make claims for compensation (repayment) when someone hurts them or hurts their property. For example, a car accident where one driver hurts another driver because he or she was not paying attention might be a tort.  If a person is hurt by someone else, he or she can sue in court.

Many torts are accidents, like car accidents or slippery floors that make people fall down and get hurt. These are called negligent torts. But some torts are done on purpose.  These are called intentional torts.  For example, if one person punches another person in the nose, it might be an intentional tort called battery.

Many torts cause physical harm to people.  Some torts cause damage to property, like a broken window.  Some torts can harm other things, like someone's reputation or a business.

The kinds of torts this article talks about are a part of the common law.  The common law is found in England and former British colonies, such as the United States of America.  Different laws are found in civil law countries such as France or Germany.  In those countries people usually use the word delict instead of tort, but they mean very similar things.

[[Lawsuit]]

CATEGORIES: Law

A lawsuit occurs when two people or organizations ask a court or judge to solve a disagreement or argument.  The two (or more) participants in a lawsuit are called the parties.  Each party is usually represented by a lawyer.  That means that the lawyer will talk to the judge for the party.

The party that starts the lawsuit is called the plaintiff because they are complaining about something the other side has done. This is also called "suing", or to "sue".  The other party is called the defendant because it must defend what it has done.  Both sides or parties will show evidence or proof that they are right and the other side or party is wrong.  The parties may also ask witnesses questions about what the argument or disagreement is about.

After both parties have shown evidence and asked witnesses questions, the judge or jury will decide which party is right.  Then the court will do something to make the winning party happy again.  The court might make the losing party pay the winner money, or it might make the losing party stop doing something that made the winner unhappy.

The conduct of a lawsuit is called litigation. The plaintiffs and defendants are called litigants and the attorneys representing them are called litigators. The term litigation may also refer to criminal trial.

[[Chamber music]]

CATEGORIES: Music genres

Chamber music means music written for small groups of instruments. A “chamber” is a “room” (from the French word “chambre”). Usually the word “chamber” in English means a room in a large house or castle. In the days when people with big houses or castles kept their own musicians, they might have their own private orchestra which played in the large hall. Sometimes there would be a concert in a small chamber. This was called “chamber music”.

Chamber music can be any group of instruments from two up to about eight or nine. Each player will be playing something different from the others (“one to a part”). Compare that to an orchestra where there may be, for example, several violins all playing the same notes.

The word “chamber” is also used for a “chamber orchestra” meaning: a small orchestra. By contrast: a large orchestra is often called a “symphony orchestra”. A small choir may be called a “chamber choir”. But these examples are not usually thought of as “chamber music”.

[[Circumcision]]

CATEGORIES: Health, Sexuality, Religious ethics, Islamic culture

Circumcision is an operation in which the foreskin is removed. In common speech, someone who has been circumcised is described as cut while someone who is not is described as uncut. For example, one teenaged boy might ask another teenaged boy, "Are you cut?" While this is slang English, it is not considered profanity. 

Circumcision may be done by a doctor using a surgical tool, such as scissors, a plastic tool called a plastibell device, or it may be done with a laser. If the doctor uses a laser there is almost no bleeding.

Circumcision may be a religious ritual, a custom in certain tribes or countries, or a medical practice.

Reasons for performing a circumcision:

[[Moirai]]

CATEGORIES: Greek gods and goddesses

The Moirai (The Fates) were the three goddesses of destiny in Greek mythology. They were Clotho, Lachesis and Atropos (Άτροπος).

They controlled the life and destiny of everyone. Clotho spins the thread of life (begins a person's or creature's life), Lachesis measures it (looks at the how long it currently is), and Atropos cuts the thread. When the thread is cut the person dies. The Moirai are capable of destroying an immortal.

The decisions of the Moriae about a person's life cannot be changed. Even Zeus is powerless to change their will.

The parents of the Moirai are not surely known. Some said they were the daughters of Zeus and the Titaness Themis, or more likely of primordial beings like Nyx, Chaos or Ananke. 

Their Roman equivalent were the Parcae.

[[Whaling]]

CATEGORIES: Fishing

Whaling is the practice of hunting whales. This is done to get meat and oil, called blubber. Hunters of whales are called whalers. Whaling has been done at least since 3000 BC. 

Many communities on the coast have done whaling for food for a long time. They have also killed stranded whales.

Industrialisation started in the 17th century and also affected whaling. Special ships were built for whaling, and whales were hunted until they were almost extinct. 

As technology improved and demand for the seemingly vast resources remained high, far more whales were killed than were born. In the late 1930s more than 50,000 whales were killed each year.  By the middle of the 20th century, there were not enough whales and they were at risk of becoming extinct.  In 1986, the International Whaling Commission introduced a moratorium on commercial whaling so that whales might recover.

This moratorium was successful, and whale stocks recovered.  There is a debate about whaling in general. Countries which are in favor of whaling want to do away with the moratorium, so they can again hunt whales as they did before.  Countries and environmental groups say that whaling is immoral and should be banned, and that stocks have not yet recovered sufficiently.

[[Opinion]]

CATEGORIES: Basic English 850 words, Human communication

An opinion is something a person or a group of people think.  "What is your opinion?" is like saying: "What do you think about it?"

The person's answer might start with: "In my opinion..........." or "I think........."

Sometimes companies try to find out what people think about something by asking many people their opinion.  This is called an "opinion poll" and the people who do it are "pollsters".  They might be trying to find out whether people think something is good or bad, such as electricity or exercise or Wikipedia, or whether one politician or beer or sport team is better than another.

[[Eating]]

CATEGORIES: Food and drink

Eating is taking in food to get energy, nutrients or for enjoyment. People and animals need to eat because they cannot make their own food inside their bodies like plants. All plants' energy comes from the sun. Plants take the sun's energy, and they are eaten by other animals as food. The animals then eat each other for the energy.

However, many people can not stop themselves from eating, and they become fat or obese. You can become fat by eating the wrong, unhealthy types of food and by eating too much. When a plant collects energy from the sun through its leaves, it is called photosynthesis. If a plant gets too much food, it can just store it until later. They use this stored food during the winter. When you are proven to be fat or obese through your body mass index (BMI), it means you are heavier than the average for your height. The taller you are, the heavier you should be, in theory. If someone is too heavy to be called fat, then they are called obese. When someone eats too much of one thing, they become fat. Someone can eat junk food, but they can also balance themselves by also eating fruits and vegetables. 

[[Bathroom]]

CATEGORIES: Rooms

A bathroom (also known as a restroom, washroom, toilet or lavatory) is where people go for personal hygiene activities. This includes use of the toilet, wash their hands, brush their teeth, take a bath, or take a shower. The room may also contain a sink, often called a "wash basin", “hair basin” or "hand basin" (in parts of the United States) and often a "lavatory." In the United States, "bathroom" mostly means "a room containing a lavatory." In other countries this is mostly called the "toilet". The word "bathroom" is also used in the United States for a public toilet or "restroom." Bathrooms also have bathroom cabinets.

[[Shower]]

CATEGORIES: Hygiene

A shower is where a person cleans themself by using water. They stand up when they use a shower and usually do not wear clothes in a shower. Showers have a shower head that squirts out water usually from above.

[[Transposing instrument]]

CATEGORIES: Musical instruments

A transposing instrument is a musical instrument that does not play the notes you might think it will play. But all the notes differ from the real notes by the same musical interval. So a song played on the transposing instrument will sound familiar, but played in a different key. That is because the transposing instrument is tuned above or below what the usual notes would be, and always above or below by the same number of notes on a scale. The usual notes are called "concert pitch". Most non-transposing instruments, like pianos, are tuned to play in the key of C.

When writing music for a transposing instrument, or teaching how to play the notes, the entire series of notes is written and described as notes moved up or down a number of semitones. For example: playing the note that is called "C" on a B flat clarinet, produces the note that is called "B♭" when played on a piano. All transposing instruments such as "horn in F" or "alto saxophone in E♭" mean F and E♭ in normal notes ("concert pitch"). The note "C" as written and played on the horn in F will sound like an "F" , and the same "C" written for the alto saxophone in E♭ will sound like "E♭".

Woodwinds, especially the recorder and clarinets, are transposing instruments. Saxophones and most brass instruments are transposing instruments.

[[Transposition (music)]]

CATEGORIES: Music, Music theory

Transposition or transposing in music means playing or writing music in a way that makes it sound higher or lower. This can be done by playing or writing the music in a different key, or by playing or writing it up or down an octave, without changing the key.

Transposing is a useful skill for people who play an instrument, especially the piano, organ, or some other keyboard instrument. If a pianist is accompanying a singer and the song is a little too high for the singer’s voice, it is very useful if he is able to transpose it down so that the music sounds in a lower key. For example, if the music is written in the key of C major, it could be transposed down a whole tone so that it sounds in B-flat major.

Most electronic keyboards and organs these days have buttons which can set notes to transpose automatically. This can be very useful, although it may be confusing for people with absolute pitch.

Geologically, the origin of the Himalayas is the impact of the Indian tectonic plate travelling northward at 15 cm per year to slowly hit the Eurasian continent, about 40-50 million years ago. The formation of the Himalayan arc resulted as the lighter rock of the seabeds of that time were easily uplifted into mountains. An often-cited fact used to illustrate this process is that the summit of Mount Everest is made of marine limestone.

About 50 million years ago, this fast moving plate had completely closed the Tethys Ocean. The existence of the Tethys has been proved by sedimentary rocks settled on the ocean floor, and the volcanoes that fringed its edges. Since these sediments were light, they crumpled into mountain ranges rather than sank to the floor. The Indian plate is still driving horizontally below the Tibetan Plateau, which forces the plateau to move upwards.

The Indo-Australian plate is still moving at 67 mm per year, and over the next 10 million years it will travel about 1,500 km into Asia. About 20 mm per year of the India-Asia convergence is absorbed by thrusting along the Himalaya southern front. This leads to the Himalayas rising by about 5 mm per year, making them geologically active. The movement of the Indian plate into the Asian plate also leads to earthquakes from time to time.

CATEGORIES: People in Greek mythology

In Greek mythology, Andromeda (Ἀνδρομέδα, Androméda or Ἀνδρομέδη, Andromédē) is an Aethiopian princess, the daughter of King Cepheus and his wife Cassiopeia. When Cassiopeia boasted that her daughter was more beautiful than the Nereids, this angered the sea god Poseidon, who sent the sea monster Ceto to ravage the land as punishment. Desperate, King Cepheus consulted the Oracle of Delphi, who stated that Andromeda must be offered as a sacrifice to the sea monster; Andromeda was then chained to a rock by the shore. When the hero Perseus saw Andromeda (having flown over after beheading Medusa), he killed the sea monster and saved Andromeda. They were soon married, with Perseus going on to found the city of Mycenae. By Perseus, she is the mother of Perses, Alcaeus, Heleus, Mestor, Sthenelus and Electryon as well as two daughters Autochthe and Gorgophone. Andromeda is also the great-grandmother of Herakles.

[[Concerto]]

CATEGORIES: Musical forms, Concertos

A concerto is a piece of music made for a solo instrument and an orchestra.  When an orchestra plays at a concert they might play a symphony (a piece for orchestra) and they might play a concerto (with a soloist).  If the solo instrument is a violin the piece is called a “violin concerto”, if it is a piano it is called a “piano concerto”, etc.  The orchestra accompanies the soloist.  This means that it is the soloist who decides how fast or slow to play.  The conductor should listen to the way the soloist wants to play and make the orchestra accompany sensitively.

The word “concerto” is an Italian word (the second “c” is pronounced like an English “ch”).  It means “agreeing” or “playing together”.  The English plural is “concertos”. 

The concerto became popular during the 17th century in Italy.  Some concertos had several soloists instead of just one.  This kind of concerto was called a concerto grosso.

[[Concerto grosso]]

CATEGORIES: Musical forms

A Concerto Grosso is a piece of music from the 18th century in which there are a small group of instruments and a large group of instruments.  These two groups are contrasted with one another. Sometimes both play together, sometimes one plays by itself, or the two groups might imitate one another.  The small group is called “concertino” and the large group is called "tutti", “ripieno” or “concerto grosso” (the same name as the musical piece).  “Concerto grosso” is Italian for “big concerto”.   The plural is “concerti grossi”.  Notice that the second “c” in “concerto” is pronounced like an English “ch”.

A concerto grosso has several parts that differ in speed and character. There are usually three movements; the first is fast, the second is slow, and the last is fast. The first movement contrasts the tutti and the soloists, the second movement is quiet, while the last movement is lively.

The composer who made the concerto grosso very popular was the Italian Arcangelo Corelli (1653-1713).  The instruments in the small group of soloists in his concerti grossi were usually two violins and one cello.  George Frideric Handel (1685-1759) also used that combination for his concerti grossi.  

Johann Sebastian Bach (1685-1750) wrote a set of six concertos known as the Brandenburg Concertos.  Each of the Brandenburg Concertos is for a different combination of instruments.  Most of them are concerti grossi.  The second one, for example, has a concertino group of four instruments: trumpet, violin, recorder and oboe.

After the Baroque period, few composers wrote concerti grossi.  They were more interested in the solo concerto.  However, in the 20th century, some composers, including Igor Stravinsky (1882-1971) and Bela Bartok (1881-1945), wrote pieces of music that are like concerti grossi.

[[Ape]]

CATEGORIES: Apes

Apes are mammals belonging to the primate family Hominoidea. Its members are called hominoids. They are native to Africa and Southeast Asia. Its living members are divided into two families:

One clear difference between monkeys and apes is that monkeys almost always have tails, but hominoids never do. There are also differences in their teeth and the way they move their arms. They have a wide degree of freedom at the shoulder joint, which helps them swing by their arms in the trees (brachiation).

The diets of apes are similar to those of other primates. They eat fruits, nuts, seeds, leaves and sometimes other animals. They are generally omnivores, though most of their intake is herbivorous.

[[Accompaniment]]

CATEGORIES: Musical terminology

An accompaniment in music is music that accompanies (goes with) something else.

A piece of music may have a melody (tune) and an accompaniment underneath.  The music may be played on the piano with the right hand playing the tune and the left hand playing the accompaniment.  The accompaniment might also be played on a different instrument.

Music does not have to be a tune with accompaniment, although it often is.  The accompaniment does not always have to be lower than the tune.  To play the piano, the pianist has to learn to play a tune in the right hand and accompaniment in the left hand, or the tune might be passed from one hand to the other.  The tune should usually be played a little louder than the accompaniment.  The accompaniment must not ‘drown’ the tune.

An accompaniment might be single notes, or chords, or any other pattern. The accompaniments help us to feel the harmony. An accompaniment might be another tune (this is called counterpoint).  Tunes can be played or sung without accompaniment.  Folk songs are traditionally sung unaccompanied.

If one instrument accompanies another, the person who plays the accompaniment is an accompanist.  The piano is the most popular instrument for accompanying in Western music.  A good pianist can accompany a violin, cello, oboe, trumpet, singer or choir.  They have to listen carefully to the instrument(s) they are accompanying, and play with the same kind of feeling.

When a soloist plays a concerto the orchestra are accompanying the soloist.  An organist playing a hymn is accompanying the congregation.  A percussion player in a rock band is accompanying the lead instrument.

Guitars and electric keyboards are often used for accompaniment.  In Elizabethan times the lute was popular.  People sang songs and often accompanied themselves on the lute or harp.  In the Baroque period the accompaniment was often played by the basso continuo (harpsichord or organ with cello or bassoon on the bass line).

The pianist Gerald Moore was a famous accompanist.  When he started his career in the 1920s people did not think that the accompanist was very important.  Sometimes their name would not even be printed in the programme.  A singer would expect the audience to start to clap as soon as they had sung their last note, even if the piano had several more bars to play.  This might not matter too much with some music, but in songs by Schubert, Wolf and other composers of Lieder the piano parts are very important.  Gerald Moore made people realize how important the accompanist is.  A good performance can be ruined by a bad accompaniment.

[[Basso continuo]]

CATEGORIES: Music

Basso continuo is a form of musical accompaniment used in the Baroque period. It means "continuous bass".

Basso continuo, sometimes just called "continuo", was played by an instrument providing chordal accompaniment such as a keyboard instrument or plucked string instrument such as the lute along with another bass instrument such as cello, violone, or bassoon. The keyboard instrument was normally a harpsichord but could also be an organ, such as a small portative instrument. 

It was not usual to write out all the notes for the keyboard player.  The composer normally just wrote the bass line which would be played by the left hand and doubled on the other bass instrument.  The composer would indicate what the harmony should be (which chords should be played) by writing figures underneath the music. 

[[Diwali]]

On the day of Deepawali, people put on their best clothes and exchange greetings, gifts and sweets with their friends and family.

At night, buildings are illuminated with earthen lamps, candle-sticks and electric bulbs. Sweets and toy shop are decorated to attract the passers-by. The bazaars and streets are overcrowded. People buy sweets for their own families and also send them as presents to their friends and relatives. The Goddess Lakshmi is also worshiped in the form of earthen images, silver rupee. Hindus believe that on this day, Lakshmi only enters houses which are neat and tidy. People offer prayers for their own health, wealth and prosperity. They leave the light on in buildings believing that Lakshmi will not have difficulty in finding her way in.

Diwali is one of the most important festival of the Hindus.It is also known as deepawali or the  festival of lights. It comes on Amavasya day in the month of kartik.

[[Malnutrition]]

CATEGORIES: Nutrition

Malnutrition is eating a diet which does not supply enough nutrients. There are two broad cateogries of malnutrition: 

Sometimes, people need to lose weight, and eat according to a special diet. This is usually not called malnutrition.

Malnutrition  is considered a more scientific and official term than starvation which has negative associations.  Malnutrition is not, however, simply a matter of eating too little.  Someone can be malnourished if they eat an unhealthy diet.  This can be cured by eating a proper balanced diet.

Children whose daily diet contains less carbohydrate and protein do not grow well.  They do not gain weight. Their hands and legs appear as skin and bones.  They cry all the time with hunger.  They are not active and have sunken eyes.  Such children often fall sick.  Lack of a particular vitamin is another kind of malnutrition which can cause a particular deficiency disease, such as beriberi and rickets.

Malnutrition becomes a bigger problem during famine because most of the people do not get enough food, hence increasing the death rate.

[[Carolina parakeet]]

CATEGORIES: Arinae, Extinct species

The Carolina parakeet is an extinct species of parrot.

It was the last parrot type to have lived before the European conquest in the eastern United States. It was found from the Ohio Valley to the Gulf of Mexico, and lived in old woods along rivers. 

The last wild Carolina parakeet was killed in Okeechobee County in Florida in 1904, and the last bird kept by people died at the Cincinnati Zoo in 1918. This was the male bird called "Incas", who died within a year of his mate "Lady Jane". It was not until 1939, however, that it was agreed that all the Carolina parakeets had died.

At some date between 1937 and 1955, three parakeets looking like this sort of bird were seen and recorded on videotape in the Okefenokee Swamp of Georgia. However, the American Ornithologists Union thought that they had probably recorded escaped pets. Additional sightings were recorded in Okeechobee County in Florida until the end of the 1920s.

[[Germ theory of disease]]

CATEGORIES: Microbiology, Medicine

The Germ theory of disease is a theory in biology. It says that small organisms (called germs), also known as microbes, cause some diseases. These diseases are called infectious diseases. The germ theory states that small organisms cause a reaction in the body of those who are infected. The body's reaction to infection is called a disease.

Many scientists and doctors in history figured out that diseases are caused by microscopic organisms. Even after the microscope was invented, people still didn't know that germs caused diseases. People long believed that "bad air" from stinky trash dumps and from rotting meat was the cause of diseases. So people thought that covering their mouth and nose with a cloth would help filter out the "bad air." Scientists and doctors would use garlic and perfumes to ward off the bad air. But people still got sick and even died, so this theory was wrong. Polluted air is not the cause of disease.

One problem with the old theories of disease was that people believed that living things were spontaneously generated. Spontaneous generation is when something like a fly grows from a small speck of smelly meat. That old theory is called abiogenesis. In the seventeenth century, Francesco Redi (February 18, 1626 – March 1, 1697) discovered that flies lay eggs that become maggots. Prior to this, people thought that maggots came from rotting meat. He discovered this by sealing some meat in a jar and watching it. No maggots were found on the sealed meat. He also put some meat in a jar and covered it with gauze. Maggots were found on the gauze but not inside the jar. But when he placed meat in an open jar, maggots were found on the meat and inside the jar. Experiments like this proved that maggots come from flies who lay eggs, not from rotting meat. Later scientists would prove that diseases did not come from the air. Diseases are spread by infection.

[[Christian cross]]

CATEGORIES: Christian symbols

The Christian cross is the main symbol of the Christian religion. These crosses are usually found on Christian churches. 

Jesus, who many Christians believe is God the Son and their Messiah, was crucified (nailed to a large wooden cross). This was a commonly used method for killing people in Roman times. 

Christians believe that Jesus' death made the sins of all humans who trust in him, go away, and that they are forgiven. They also believe that Jesus was resurrected (came back to life) after three days. Because of this, the cross is a symbol for Jesus' sacrifice and suffering, but also a symbol of hope, forgiveness of sins, and victory over death.

There are several different Christian crosses that are symbols for different Christian groups or persons.

A cross with the body of Jesus on it is called a Crucifix.

The empty cross is usually favoured by Protestants and Eastern Orthodox, and the symbol reminds them of the Resurrection of Jesus, though the Orthodox will add a slanted footbar, as well. The crucifix is favoured by Catholic churches and is a reminder of Christ's sacrifice. Jehovah's Witnesses believe that Jesus died on a simple upright pole, a "torture stake" ; and only display it as a picture of an impaled Jesus in their literature.

Christians remember the death of Jesus on the cross on Good Friday every year.

[[Recycling]]

CATEGORIES: Recycling

Recycling is the process of recovering scrap or waste  and reprocessing the material into useful products. Glass, paper, plastic, and metals such as aluminum and steel are all commonly recycled. Dead plants, fruit and vegetable scraps can be recycled through composting. It is important, however, not to confuse recycling with reusing, which is where old things, such as clothes, are donated or given a new use instead of being thrown out.

One reason that people give for recycling is that it reduces trash in landfills and incinerators. Another reason people recycle is to reduce the amount of raw materials and energy used in making things. Most of the time, it takes less energy to recycle trash than to throw it away, The Economist says. Recycling can reduce your carbon footprint and it can help to minimize the whole size of landfills around the world.

The 3 R's are Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle.

[[Transnistria]]

CATEGORIES: Moldova, Unrecognized countries

Transnistria, Transdniestria, or Pridnestrovie, officially the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic (PMR; Pridnestrovskaya Moldavskaya Respublika), is a partially-recognized state in Eastern Europe. 

The country is recognized by three other partially or unrecognized states, Abkhazia, Nargorno-Karabakh Republic, and South Ossetia. The country declared independence from Moldova on 2 September 1990. With the help of the Russian army, it defeated the Moldovan army in the War of Transnistria. 

There has been peace since 1992, but the Council of Europe calls Transnistria a "frozen conflict" region.

There is argument about whether it is really a country or not. The region continues to boast independence, and acts independently over its territory with the help of peacekeeping forces from foreign countries.

In a vote in 17 September 2006, 97% voted to be free from Moldova. This vote has not been accepted by Moldova, which calls the territory the "Territory of the Left Bank of the Dniester".

Transnistria is the only independent state to still use the hammer and sickle on its flag.

[[Mercalli intensity scale]]

CATEGORIES: Geology

The Mercalli intensity scale (or more precisely the Modified Mercalli intensity scale) is a scale to measure the intensity of earthquakes. Unlike with the Richter scale, the Mercalli scale does not take into account energy of an earthquake directly. Rather, they classify earthquakes by the effects they have (and the destruction they cause). When there is little damage, the scale describes how people felt the earthquake, or how many people felt it.

Very often, non-geologists use this scale, because it is easier for people to describe what damage an earthquake caused, than to do calculations to get a value on the Richter scale.

Values range from I - Instrumental to XII - Catastrophic. Ola is Dora 

Giuseppe Mercalli (1850-1914) originally developed the scale, with ten levels. In 1902,  Adolfo Cancani extended the scale to include twelve levels.  August Heinrich Sieberg completely rewrote the scale. For this reason, the scale is sometimes named Mercalli-Cancani-Sieberg scale, or MCS scale.

Harry O. Wood and Frank Neumann translated it into English, and published it as  Mercalli–Wood–Neumann (MWN) scale. Charles Francis Richter also edited it. He also developed the Richter scale, later on.

[[Chinese Civil War]]

CATEGORIES: Wars involving China, Wars of independence, Rebellions in Asia, 20th century rebellions, Civil wars, 20th century in China

The Chinese Civil War was a civil war fought from 1927 to 1951 because of differences in thinking between the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the Kuomintang (KMT, or Chinese Nationalist Party). The war was a fight for legitimacy as the government of China. The war began in April 1927 because of the Northern Expedition (國民革命軍北伐) and mostly ended in 1950. Some people say the war has not ended, but no large battles have started since that year. Relations between the Republic of China (ROC) and the People's Republic of China (PRC) are still poor because both claim to be the legitimate sovereign government of all of China. The Chinese Civil War was the third-largest war in all of time, after World War II and World War I.

The war started and stopped several times before the Second Sino-Japanese War and did not stop even after the Empire of Japan had invaded. The war between the CCP and the KMT started again in 1946 after Japan's defeat in World War II. The CCP took control of most of China, and the KMT had only islands left. About two million Chinese fled to Taiwan in late 1949. In 1950, no large battles were started.The loss of the KMT in Mainland China is said to be for several reasons: 

No agreement was made between the two governments and so some say that the war has not ended. Both governments have many military weapons to be used against only against each other, both still say they are the legitimate government of China, and both seek diplomatic relations with other countries as the only legitimate government.

It started because the editor of a newspaper called La Gazzetta dello Sport wanted more people to read his newspaper.  He planned a race similar to the Tour de France, which had started in 1903.

The leader of the race wears a pink jersey called the maglia rosa.  This is because pink is the colour of La Gazzetta dello Sport.  For many years, the leader of the mountain climbing competition wore a green jersey (called the maglia verde), but a change in the sponsor for that competition led to a jersey change in 2012. The mountains leader now wears a blue jersey (called the maglia azzurra). Similarly, the leader of the sprinters' competition wore a mauve jersey (called the maglia ciclamino) for many years. However, a sponsorship change in 2010 also led to a jersey change. The sprints leader now wears a red jersey (called maglia rosso passione).  The leader of the young riders' competition, for riders under age 25, wears a white jersey (called the maglia bianca).  This is the same as the young riders' competition in the Tour de France.

Tiberius (Tiberius Julius Caesar Augustus, 16 November 42 BC – 16 March 37 AD) was the second Roman Emperor. He ruled from 14 to 37 AD. He was the step-son of Caesar Augustus.

Tiberius was one of Ancient Rome's greatest generals, whose campaigns protected the northern frontier. He reigned for 22 years, and the first part of his imperial work was excellent. Later, he came to be remembered as a dark, reclusive, and somber ruler. After the death of his son Drusus in 23, the quality of his rule declined and ended in terror.

In 26, Tiberius moved from Rome to the Isle of Capri, and left administration largely in the hands of his unscrupulous Praetorian Prefect Sejanus. Sejanus became the effective ruler of Rome, and plotted against Tiberius, murdering people who opposed him. When alerted, Tiberius counter-plotted to remove Sejanus from his official positions, and eventually executed him. More executions followed of people who had committed crimes under Sejanus' rule.

Caligula, Tiberius' grand-nephew and adopted grandson, succeeded the Emperor upon his death.

[[Sunlight]]

CATEGORIES: Light, Solar System, Natural resources, Solar energy, Electromagnetic radiation

Sunlight is the light and energy that comes from the Sun. When this energy reaches the earth's surface, it is called insolation. What we experience as sunlight is actually solar radiation. It is the radiation and heat from the Sun in the form of electromagnetic waves.

The atmosphere affects the amount of solar radiation received. When solar radiation travels through the atmosphere, some of it is absorbed by the atmosphere (16%). Some of it is scattered to space (6%). Some of it is reflected by clouds (28%). About 47% of it reaches the Earth's surface.

Without sunlight, there could not be life on the Earth. Plants need sunlight for the process of photosynthesis. During photosynthesis the plants use the energy of the sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide, to create glucose (sugar). The glucose can later be used by the plant for energy or animals eat the plant and the glucose in it. Plants need sunlight to grow green. Without enough sunlight but with enough water, the plant grows very tall very quickly, but looks yellow and dehydrated, although when touched, the leaves are very moist.

Solar radiation can be both good and bad for a person's health. When in the light, the human body uses the ultraviolet part of sunlight to make its own Vitamin D. Without sunscreen too much ultraviolet light can cause sunburn and skin cancer.  Sun angle makes difference in seasons on Earth as well as in the length of day and night.  A high angle makes the tropics hot, and a low angle makes the arctic cold.

[[Theism]]

CATEGORIES: Theology

Theism is the religious belief that at least one god exists while rejecting the existence or importance of polytheistic gods or goddesses.

An atheist is a person who denies or disbelieves the existence of a supreme being or beings.

[[Plesiosaur]]

CATEGORIES: Plesiosaurs

The plesiosaurs were an order of large, carnivorous marine reptiles. They flourished from 245 million years ago (mya) to 65 mya.

In 1719, William Stukeley described the first partial skeleton of a plesiosaur. The great-grandfather of Charles Darwin, Robert Darwin of Elston told him about it.

Mary Anning was the first to discover a fairly complete plesiosaur. She found it on the 'Jurassic Coast' of Dorset, England in the winter of 1820/21. The fossil was missing its skull, but in 1823 she found another one, this time complete with its skull. The name Plesiosaurus was given to it by the Rev. William Conybeare. 

The earliest plesiosaur remains are from the Middle Triassic period,p128 and the group was important through the Jurassic and Cretaceous. They had two large pairs of paddles, short tails, short or long necks, and broad bodies. They died out at the K/T extinction event, 65 million years ago.

[[Nuclear reactor]]

CATEGORIES: Nuclear energy

A nuclear reactor is a machine that uses fission to generate heat. There are different designs which use different fuels. Most often,  uranium-235 or plutonium-239 are the main components of these fuels.

Most nuclear reactors are used to make electricity. In nuclear power plants heat from the fission reactions in the reactor changes water into steam.  The steam is then used to power electric turbines which make electricity.   As with other steam engines, the turbines take energy from the movement of the steam.

Some reactors are used for other purposes. Some reactors make neutrons for science research and others make radioactive isotopes. Some universities have small nuclear reactors to teach students how reactors work.

The first nuclear reactor was built in 1942 by a team of scientists led by Enrico Fermi. This was a part of the Manhattan Project which needed the fuel from the reactor to make the atomic bomb. The first nuclear reactor to make electricity was a small experimental reactor built in Idaho in 1951. It made just enough electricity for four light globes.

Nuclear reactors are expensive to build because of the many safety features they need to have. There is also a problem with the huge amount of radioactive waste from the reactors. However they produce electricity cheaply, and do not pollute the air. There have been serious accidents at several nuclear reactors: Windscale (UK) 1957, Mayak (USSR) 1957, Three Mile Island (USA) 1979, Chernobyl (USSR) 1986 and Fukushima (Japan) 2011. Concerns about safety have limited the growth of nuclear power. There are about 437 reactors around the world which provide about 5% of the world's electricity.

[[Blue whale]]

CATEGORIES: Baleen whales

The blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus) is a marine mammal of the suborder of baleen whales (called Mysticeti). They grow to be about 30 meters long. The biggest blue whale found was 190 tons and measured 98 feet long. Larger specimens have been measured at 110 feet, but never weighed. This makes blue whales the largest animals ever to be on Earth, even bigger than the largest dinosaurs. 

The blue whale eats mostly very tiny creatures, like krill. These inch-long, shrimp-like crustacean swim in swarms. In the Antarctic summer, there are so many of these krill that they turn the waters orange. A blue whale can eat eight to ten tons of krill every day.

The blue whale's body is long and slender. It can be various shades of bluish-grey above and somewhat lighter underneath. There are at least three distinct subspecies: B. m. musculus of the North Atlantic and North Pacific, B. m. intermedia of the Southern Ocean and B. m. brevicauda (also known as the pygmy blue whale) found in the Indian Ocean and South Pacific Ocean. B. m. indica, found in the Indian Ocean, may be another subspecies. As with other baleen whales, its diet consists almost exclusively of small krill.

Blue whales were once abundant around the world. In the nineteenth century, they were hunted almost to extinction by whalers. They were finally protected by the international community in 1966. A 2002 report estimated there were 5,000 to 12,000 blue whales worldwide, located in at least five groups. More recent research into the Pygmy subspecies suggests this may be an underestimate. Before whaling, the largest population was in the Antarctic, numbering approximately 239,000 (range 202,000 to 311,000). There remain only much smaller (around 2,000) concentrations in each of the eastern North Pacific, Antarctic, and Indian Ocean groups. There are two more groups in the North Atlantic, and at least two in the Southern Hemisphere. The North Atlantic group of Blue Whales can be seen in the Saguenay-St. Lawrence Marine Park near Tadoussac QC, Canada.

[[Cetacea]]

CATEGORIES: Cetaceans

The order Cetacea are marine mammals that live in oceans, seas, and even a few rivers around the world. Whales, dolphins, and porpoises are part of this group. These common name refer to size: whales are the largest, porpoises the smallest. How and what they eat is a better guide to their relationships. The study of cetaceans is called cetology.

Cetaceans are ocean creatures without toes, but are classified in the related order Cetartiodactyla because their ancestors were even toed ungulates.

[[Scottish Gaelic language]]

CATEGORIES: Celtic languages, Languages of Europe

Scottish Gaelic (Gàidhlig, pronounced "Gah-lick") is a Celtic language. It is commonly called just Scots Gaelic in English.

[[West Germanic languages]]

CATEGORIES: West Germanic languages, Languages of Europe

The West Germanic Languages are a branch of Germanic languages first spoken in Central Europe and the British Isles. The branch has three parts: the North Sea Germanic languages, the Weser-Rhine Germanic languages, and the Elbe Germanic languages. The most spoken languages in the branch are English, German, and Dutch. 

These languages were spread around the world in the Colonial Era. English is now spoken by around 400 million people natively.

[[Germanic languages]]

CATEGORIES: Germanic languages, Languages of Europe

The Germanic languages are a branch of Indo-European languages. They came from one language, Proto-Germanic, which was first spoken in Scandinavia in the Iron Age. They are spoken by around 515 million people natively. English is the most spoken Germanic language, with 360-400 million native speakers.

The Germanic languages are separated into the East Germanic languages (all extinct), the North Germanic languages and the West Germanic languages.

Pac-Man is an arcade video game that was made by Namco and designed by Toru Iwatani. It was released in 1980, and became very popular in the history of games.

In Pac-Man, the player makes a Pac-Man, a yellow disc, move around a maze. The ghosts are Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde. The goal is to eat every yellow pellet (circles) while not getting caught by the ghosts/monsters. For extra points, fruits that appear can also be eaten. When Pac-Man eats a big pellet, the ghosts turn blue and can be eaten. Even though the game has 256 stages, the last level can not be finished due to a problem with the creation of the game. 

The game is called Puck-Man in Japan. The game was renamed to Pac-Man in the United States so that nobody could change the "P" to "F". There were many sequels and remakes based on the game. Hanna-Barbera made a animated TV show airing on ABC in the early 1970s. The game was also part of Namco Museum games. There is a Namco Museum Remix for the Wii.

Pac-Man was one of the first games to have cutscenes. It has 3 cutscenes in total.

[[Domestic violence]]

CATEGORIES: Domestic violence, Women's rights

Domestic violence means that in a relationship or marriage, one or both of the partners uses physical, sexual or psychological violence to try to get power or control over the other or due to losing their temper. Domestic violence can occur in heterosexual and same-sex relationships. There is often a predictable pattern or cycle of violence in a relationship and the abuse tends to get worse over time. Domestic violence can be also a factor to be homeless, as pointed out by Principles 15 of the Yogyakarta Principles. 

In any culture or community, there are beliefs and attitudes that support domestic violence and beliefs and attitudes that do not support domestic violence. In most countries, laws exist to protect the victim of such violent acts. There are also organisations that can help in such situations. 

Domestic violence sometimes does not get reported to the police. Estimates say that only a third of domestic violence cases (or even less) get reported to the authoritiesJuly 2010.

Many people who use violence against their partners have mental disorders, especially antisocial personality disorder and borderline personality disorder.February 2016

[[Archaeopteryx]]

CATEGORIES: Birds, Coelurosaurs, Dinosaurs of Europe, Jurassic dinosaurs, Feathered dinosaurs

Archaeopteryx is one of the most important fossils ever discovered. It is a bird from the Upper Jurassic, about 150 million years ago. It shows the evolutionary link between non-avian theropod dinosaurs and birds, but it is not the ancestor of modern birds. 

The first Archaeopteryx was found in 1860 near Solnhofen in Bavaria, Germany. Today, ten skeletons and one feather of Archaeopteryx have been found.

Archaeopteryx looked like a small carnivorous dinosaur with wings and feathers. It had a mouth with teeth, claws on the hands and a long tail. Today, it is known that dromaeosaurs, and possibly most theropods, looked like birds and that many had feathers. When they are born, today's South American hoatzin have claws on their wings when they are young, just like Archaeopteryx.

[[Snail]]

CATEGORIES: Gastropods

A snail is a common name for a kind of mollusc. The term is used for a gastropod with a coiled shell. Their fossil records extends back into the Carboniferous period.

Land snails and slugs breathe with a kind of lung. They used to be put together in a group, the Pulmonata. This was a well-known order in traditional taxonomy. However, the Pulmonata is polyphyletic. This means the same life-style evolved in a number of different lines. This is called convergent evolution. Therefore, the Pulmonata is no longer an official term in biological classification.

The term "snail" is also sometimes used for aquatic snail-like gastropods, which usually have gills. Actually, most snail species are marine snails. There are more species of them, and they are far greater in numbers. Many kinds of snails can also be found in fresh water habitats.

Most land snails and slugs are herbivorous. Aquatic snails and slugs are usually omnivores or predatory carnivores.

In many countries around the world, people eat snails as a delicacy. In France, snails are called escargots, which is also the name of the dish. In French cuisine, the snails are cooked in salt water and then served with a garlic sauce.

The biggest snail is the giant African snail. Their foot is up to 35 cm long.

The fastest snail is the Helix aspersa. It can reach speeds up to 0.047 kmh.

There are known more than 43000 species of snails all over the world.

At the lower Ruwer valley are the villages Waldrach, Kasel, Mertesdorf, Eitelsbach and Ruwer.

[[Slug]]

CATEGORIES: Gastropods

Slug is a general term for a gastropod mollusc which has no shell, or just a small internal shell. 

Slugs belong to several different families which also include snails with shells. Snails are gastropods with a coiled shell large enough for the animal to pull back inside. The families of land slugs are not very closely related, despite looking similar. The shell-less slug type is an example of convergent evolution, and so the category "slug" is  not a taxonomic category.

The name "slug" is used for air-breathing land slugs, while the marine forms are usually known as sea slugs. Land gastropods with a shell that is too small to hide the body are sometimes called semislugs.

[[Ruwer]]

Ruwer could mean:

[[Ruwer (municipality)]]

CATEGORIES: Geography of Rhineland-Palatinate

Ruwer is a municipality (a convention community called Verbandsgemeinde Ruwer) on the River Ruwer. The administrative offices are in the town of Waldrach, and it should not be confused with the nearby town of Ruwer, which is for administrative purposes a part of the city of Trier.

[[Gunpowder]]

CATEGORIES: Firearms

Gunpowder (or gun powder) is a mix of chemical substances (75%  saltpeter, 15% charcoal and 10% sulfur). It is used primarily in firearms, burns very quickly, and creates gases. Those gases use up more space than the gunpowder they come from, so they push outward. If the gunpowder is in a small space, the gases will push on the walls of the space, building up pressure. In a gun, the pressure pushes against a bullet, causing it to fly out at high speeds. If the pressure became too high, it could destroy the gun barrel.

Gunpowder was invented by the Chinese. The first references of black powder, the original form of gunpowder, date to the 9th century. According to legend, Chinese alchemists were looking for a formula to create the elixir of life, or the mythical potion that causes whoever drinks it to become immortal, when they accidentally created gunpowder. Because the powder was highly flammable, or burned very easily, they decided to call it "fire medicine" (Simplified Chinese: 火药 / Traditional Chinese: 火藥). The Chinese soon weaponized the substance, or made weapons out of it. In later centuries they made many weapons using gunpowder, including rockets, bombs, flamethrowers, and land mines, before making cannons and guns. The oldest weapon that uses gunpowder dates back to a bronze handheld cannon made in northeastern China in 1288. The first mention in Europe was in the 13th century when Roger Bacon described the formula of black powder. Gunpowder was extremely valuable to the Chinese civilization, in fact so valuable that sometimes it was traded for gold.

[[Mayor]]

CATEGORIES: Mayors, Government occupations

A mayor is a person who is in charge of the administration of a city.  Some mayors are elected by the people who live in that city.  For other cities, a central government body may choose the mayor.  Some large cities have a Lord Mayor.

In federal countries like Germany the mayor can also be head of the government of a city state. The Mayor of Hamburg runs the government just like the Minister President of Bavaria runs the Bavarian government. In some big cities such as Tokyo the Mayor is a Governor.

In many countries, such as the United Kingdom and Australia, the mayor is not in charge of the daily functions of a city or town. That job is done by a Town Clerk or Chief Executive, who is appointed to a full-time paid job. The mayor works part-time, usually without payment, and represents the city at events and civic functions.

[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]

CATEGORIES: Plays by William Shakespeare

A Midsummer Night's Dream is a play by William Shakespeare. The exact date the play was written is unknown. It is generally accepted that the play was written in 1595 or 1596. It was first printed in 1600. In 1623, the play was printed in the First Folio, a collection of all of Shakespeare's plays. 

Shakespeare's sources include works by Plutarch, Apuleius, Ovid,  Geoffrey Chaucer, and Edmund Spenser. He found a description of Puck in Reginald Scot's The Discoverie of Witchcraft (1584). It is generally believed that the play was written for the festivities surrounding the aristocratic marriage of either Elizabeth Vere, Lord Burghley’s granddaughter, in 1595, or Elizabeth Carey, daughter of Sir George Carey, in 1596.

The play is about four confused young lovers, a group of clumsy workmen, the royal court of Duke Theseus, and the royal fairy court of King Oberon and Queen Titania.  The play is set mostly at night in the woods near Athens. 

The play has been made into movies on numerous occasions. One movie stars Mickey Rooney as the fairy Puck. Benjamin Britten wrote an opera based on the play, George Balanchine and Frederick Ashton have both made ballets about it, and Felix Mendelssohn wrote many pieces of music for the play which include an "Overture" and a "Wedding March".

[[Sexual reproduction]]

CATEGORIES: Methods of reproduction

Sexual reproduction is how most animals and plants reproduce. Some protists and fungi also reproduce this way. Organisms that reproduce sexually have two different sexes: male and female.

In sexual reproduction, offspring are produced when sperms fertilise eggs from the female. Various steps are involved in this process.

[[Leprosy]]

CATEGORIES: Diseases caused by bacteria

Leprosy is a contagious disease. It has been known for a very long time. Today, it is mostly called Hansen's disease, named after the person who discovered the bacterium, Gerhard Armauer Hansen. It is caused by a bacterium, Mycobacterium leprae. A person with leprosy is called a leper.

As of 2004, the estimated number of new infections was about 400,000.

Getting the disease is hard, since it requires close contact with someone who has it, over a long period of time. In addition, about 95% of people seem to be naturally immune to it.

Most cases of leprosy occur in India, and other developing countries. It has known to have been in the US before. There are practically no cases of leprosy in the developed world. This is because there are excellent drugs and people regularly take antibiotics which will kill the leprosy bacteria.

In former times, leprosy was seen as a divine punishment for sins committed.

Their names were John Payne (1792-1852) and William Temple (born and died in 1793). William died in a yellow fever epidemic. In the same year, her husband also died of the same yellow fever epidemic.

Dolley Todd married James Madison on September 14, 1794. They had no children, but they raised Dolley's son from her first marriage, John Payne Todd. John Payne Todd was a notorious drunkard and gambler, which caused his mother many financial problems, especially after Madison died.

In 1814, the British army had burnt the White House. Fleeing from her burning home, Dolley saved many records and papers. Legend states she also saved a painting of George Washington, though had to break it out of its frame.

On the National First Lady Library she says, "There is one secret, and that is the power we have in forming our own destinies."

[[Lung cancer]]

CATEGORIES: Cancer

Lung cancer is the uncontrollable growth of abnormal cells in one or both of the lungs. Cigarette smoking causes most lung cancers when smoke gets in the lungs. Lung cancer kills 1.8 million people each year, more than any other cancer. It is currently the leading cause of cancer death in men, and the second leading cause of cancer death in women. 

The large majority of people who get lung cancer have smoked for many years. However, there are types of lung cancers that appear in otherwise healthy patients who have never smoked.

There are two main types of lung cancer, small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. Small cell lung cancer typically responds well to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and non-small cell lung cancer is more commonly treated with surgical removal of the lung tumor.

Non-small cell lung cancer

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) account for about 85% to 90% of lung cancer cases. There are three types of non-small cell lung cancer:

[[Superpower]]

CATEGORIES: Countries, Politics

A superpower is a country that is one of the most powerful countries in the world. It is more powerful than a great power and less powerful than a hyperpower. Right now, only the United States is a superpower. However, China may become a superpower in the future. Others say that it will not become a superpower.

In the years following World War II, the United Nations was formed. The 5 countries that would later have nuclear bombs – those who would be able to start a nuclear war – were all given permanent seats on the Security Council. This means they are on the Security Council forever. They were also all given equal veto power over decisions in the Security Council. These five countries were: United States, United Kingdom, China, France, and the Soviet Union.

For most of the 1900s, the Soviet Union was a superpower. After the Soviet Union split into a lot of smaller countries in 1991, it was not a superpower anymore. Russia got most of the Soviet Union's nuclear weapons, and also its permanent seat in the Security Council. Some other countries also have nuclear weapons now, and can also start a nuclear war just as well, but they are not permanent members with veto power. The Republic of India, North Korea and Pakistan are a few countries like this.

One descendant, Elizabeth Peyre Richardson, was so closely related to all of these governors that she appears in Ripley's Believe it or Not.  Angelica's sister, Marion, has a bio that, although sad, is actually more interesting than hers.  See "A Tale of Two Sisters," by Joseph C. Elliott, Sandlapper: The Magazine of South Carolina.

Jacqueline Lee Kennedy Onassis (Bouvier ˈ BOO; July 28, 1929spndMay 19, 1994) was an American socialite, writer, photographer and book editor. She was the First Lady of the United States from January 20, 1961 until November 22, 1963 as the wife of 35th U.S. President John F. Kennedy. She was popular as First Lady because she helped preserved the White House and for her fashion style. One of her best known fashion outfits was her pink Chanel suit and matching pillbox hat that she wore in Dallas, Texas, when the president was assassinated on November 22, 1963. It has become a symbol of her husband's death.

Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis was born on July 28, 1929 in Southampton, New York, to Wall Street stockbroker John Vernou Bouvier III and socialite Janet Lee Bouvier. In 1951, she graduated from George Washington University and worked for the Washington Times-Herald as a photographer. A year later, she met then-U.S. Representative John F. Kennedy at a dinner party in Washington D.C. 

He was elected to the Senate that same year, and the couple married on September 12, 1953, in Newport, Rhode Island. They had four children, two of which died in infancy. After her husband was elected President of the United States in 1960, Kennedy was known for her restoration of the White House and support of arts and culture. At age 31, she was the third-youngest First Lady of the United States when her husband inaugurated and became president on January 20, 1961.

After the assassination and funeral of her husband, Kennedy and her two children retired from public life. In October 1968, she married a Greek businessman named Aristotle Onassis, which made her less popular and famous. After his death in 1975, she had a career as a book editor in New York City, first at Viking Press and then at Doubleday. Even after her death, she is still seen as one of the most popular and well known first ladies in American History. In 1999, she was named as one of Gallup's Most-Admired Men and Women of the 20th century.

[[Fowl]]

CATEGORIES: Birds, Basic English 850 words, Animals

Fowls are birds belonging to one of two biological orders, namely the gamefowl or landfowl (Galliformes) and the waterfowl (Anseriformes). It happens that birds in these groups are good to eat, and often hunted by gun. So the word 'fowl' may be used for a game bird. The group is mostly of birds we hunt or farm, and which we eat. Studies of anatomical and molecular similarities suggest these two groups are close evolutionary relatives. Together, they form the fowl clade, the Galloanserae. This clade is also supported by morphological and DNA sequence data, as well as retrotransposon data.

[[Monotreme]]

CATEGORIES: Monotremes, Living fossils

Monotremes are a group of mammals that form the order Monotremata. Monotremes are the only mammals that lay eggs, but they also feed their babies with milk.

The word 'monotreme' refers to their common rear opening, the cloaca. In amphibia, reptiles, birds and probably all early tetrapods, there is a common opening for urine, reproduction and faeces.

== Evolution == 

Monotremes are derived from earlier mammals than the marsupials and eutherians, but their fossil record is poor. 

The time at which the monotreme line diverged from other mammalian lines is uncertain, but one survey of genetic studies gives an estimate of about 220 million years ago. This is in the Upper Triassic. Fossils of a jaw fragment 110 million years old were found at Lightning Ridge, New South Wales. This means they originated up to 100 million years before the Metatheria or Eutheria, so they are definitely 'living fossils'.

[[Metatheria]]

CATEGORIES: Metatheria

Metatheria is a group in the class Mammalia which contains the marsupials and the sparassodonts. 

First proposed by Thomas Henry Huxley in 1880, it is nearly synonymous with the earlier taxon Marsupialia, but it also contains the nearest fossil relatives of marsupial mammals. They differ from all other mammals in their dental formula, which includes about five upper and four lower incisors, a canine, three premolars, and four molars.

The earliest known representative, Sinodelphys, is from the Lower Cretaceous of China. 

The closest relatives of the metatheres are the Eutheria (also erected by Huxley in 1880). Both are conventionally united as infraclasses within the subclass Theria, which contains all living mammals except monotremes.

During development, metatherians produce a yolk sac placenta and give birth to 'larval-like' offspring. 

These offspring have underdeveloped rear limbs, and after birth they migrate to the marsupium where they attach to a nipple. The mouth of newly born metatherians forms an "O" shape into which the mother's nipple fits. Then it swells to secure the offspring into place.

The Greek words meta- and theria roughly means the "other beasts", in contrast with Eutheria ("true beasts").

The Soviet war in Afghanistan was a war initially fought between the forces of the Afghanistan government and Afghan assistance fighters, supporter from abroad. Without proper equipment and training, the Afghanistan government was unable to resist the opposition, called the Mujahideen, eventually seeking the aid of the Soviet Union. The entry of the Soviet Union into the country caused an immediate increase in the presence of foreign involvement. Massive military campaigns against the Mujahideen, who blended in with the local population, caused extensive destruction of local infrastructure and death, causing the local population to side with the Mujahideen. This change, among the local population, caused a loss of support for the Soviet military presence, creating nationwide resistance, and eventually a conflict. The war began in December 1979, and lasted until February 1989. About 15,000 Soviet soldiers were killed, and about 35,000 were wounded. About two million Afghan civilians were killed. The anti-government forces had support from many countries, mainly the United States and Pakistan.

The war started when the Soviet Union sent its 40th Army to fight in Afghanistan. They reached Afghanistan on 25 December 1979. The fighting continued for about ten years. Then, from 15 May 1988, the Soviet troops started to leave Afghanistan. This continued until 2 February 1989. On 15 February 1989, the Soviet Union announced that all its troops had left Afghanistan.

CATEGORIES: Arthurian legend, Fictional knights

Sir Lancelot is a legendary character in the legend of King Arthur, and was a Knight of the Round Table. Sir Lancelot of the Lake was one of the most trusted knights of King Arthur's Round Table, but this soon changed when he fell in love with the king's wife, Queen Guinevere. He was raised by the Lady of the Lake, hence his title Lancelot Du Lac. Sir Lancelot was the only knight known to defeat King Arthur during a jousting match. He is also known briefly as the father of Sir Galahad, the greatest knight of all Camelot. Sir Galahad's mother is also possibly Elaine Of Configure.

Lancelot was a Red Cross Knight, which meant that he was one of the knights in the quest to find the Holy Grail. He saw the ascension of Sir Galahad. His first appearance as a main character is in Chrétien de Troyes' Le Chevalier de la Charrette ("The Knight of the Cart"), written in the 12th century, where his exploits are recounted in the section known as the Prose Lancelot, often with conflicting background stories and chains of events.

[[Flag of Singapore]]

CATEGORIES: National flags, Singapore

The Flag of Singapore consists of two horizontal halves, red above white. Red symbolises universal brotherhood and equality of man; white stands for pervading and everlasting purity and virtue. In the upper left corner, a white crescent moon and five white stars form a circle. The five stars stand for the ideals of democracy, peace, progress, justice and equality. 

For 140 years (1819-1959), the Union Jack flew over Singapore. Then, on 3 December 1959, the National Flag was unveiled at the installation of the new Head of State, the Yang di-Pertuan Negara, when Singapore was granted self-rule (but not complete independence) by the British Government. Also unveiled that day were the State Crest and the National Anthem. The flag was conceived and created by a committee headed by then Deputy Prime Minister, Dr Toh Chin Chye.

She was born in Calvert County, Maryland. Her mother’s name was Ann Mackall and her father’s name was Walter Smith. Her father was a major in the American Revolutionary War. When she was visiting her sister in Kentucky in 1809, she met Zachary Taylor. Taylor was a lieutenant at that time. They married in June 1810. For sometime, she stayed in a farm she had got as a marriage gift from her father. There she gave birth to her first baby. But, then she started to live with her husband. Taylor’s garrison moved from one location to other on the western front, and she also moved with him. 

Their two small daughters died in 1820. As described by Taylor, the children had died of “a violent bilious fever.” They had three other girls and a boy. All four grew to adulthood. Taylor knew the difficult life of a military man. He was always against their daughters marrying military men, but all the three married military persons from the United States Army.

At the White House, Peggy Taylor participated in the household activities and personal functions. She did not participate in formal and official functions. Her youngest daughter, Mary Elizabeth Bliss, acted as the official hostess for her mother.

[[Persian Gulf]]

CATEGORIES: Middle East, Gulfs

The Persian Gulf is the name of a geographical place. Its location is in the Middle East. It is an extension of the Gulf of Oman. It is between Iran and the Arabian Peninsula, and the Arabs prefer to call it the "Gulf of the Arabs". 

During the Iran-Iraq War (1980-1988), the Persian Gulf came into news. Both sides attacked oil tankers of each other. Later, when Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1991, the new war got the name of "Gulf War" but major fighting happened on land.

The water in the Persian Gulf is rich in fishes; it has long beautiful coral reefs. Deep inside the water of the Persian Gulf, there are many pearl oysters. Due to this, the area attracts a lot of activities.

In Persian language, the term khalīj-e-Fars means the Persian Gulf. On October 2018, the World Intellectual Property Organization of the United Nations registered Persian Gulf as a place of origin, based on the Lisbon Agreement for the Protection of Appellations of Origin and their International Registration.

[[Hypnosis]]

CATEGORIES: Psychology, Consciousness

Hypnosis is "a trance state characterized by extreme suggestibility, relaxation and heightened imagination".

It is an altered state of consciousness.

Usually, one person (the "hypnotist") talks to another (the "subject") in a special way that puts the subject into a trance. While the subject is in this state, he can be influenced by suggestions. The hypnotist can tell him to forget his name, or that the room is hot (he will start sweating), or that he is someone else. Hypnotic suggestions may be delivered by a hypnotist in the presence of the subject, or may be self-administered ('self-suggestion' or 'autosuggestion'). The use of hypnotism for therapeutic purposes is referred to as 'hypnotherapy', while its use as a form of entertainment for an audience is known as 'stage hypnosis'.

Contrary to a popular misconception—that hypnosis is a form of unconsciousness resembling sleep—some contemporary research suggests that hypnotic subjects are fully awake and are focusing attention, with a corresponding decrease in their peripheral awareness. Subjects also show an increased response to suggestions. However, the behaviour of subjects under hypnotism goes so far beyond normal focused attention that the description of "altered state of consciousness" is more used.

[[Inclined plane]]

CATEGORIES: Machines

An inclined plane is a simple machine. It allows one to use less force to move an object.

Examples of inclined planes are ramps, sloping roads and hills, plows, chisels, hatchets, carpenter's planes, and wedges.  The typical example of an inclined plane is a sloped surface; for example a roadway to bridge at a different height.

Another simple machine based on the inclined plane is the blade, in which two inclined planes placed back to back allow the two parts of the cut object to move apart using less force than would be needed to pull them apart in opposite directions.

The giant panda, Ailuropoda melanoleuca, is a bear. It lives in south central China. 

Although it belongs to the order Carnivora, the panda's diet is 99% bamboo. Pandas in the wild occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in the form of birds, rodents or carrion. In captivity, they may get honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, or bananas along with specially prepared food.

The giant panda lives in a few mountain ranges in central China, mainly in Sichuan province, but also in the Shaanxi and Gansu provinces.

As a result of farming, deforestation and other development, the panda has been driven out of the lowland areas where it once lived.

[[Game Boy Color]]

CATEGORIES: Game Boy, Nintendo video game consoles

The Game Boy Color (often said as GBC) is a video game console manufactured by Nintendo. It was first introduced in Japan in October 1998 and released in North America, Europe and Australia in November 1998. It is the successor to the original Game Boy, but it precedes the Game Boy Advance (which is backwards compatible with GB and GBC games). The biggest innovation of the Game Boy Color was its colorful graphics. The Game Boy Color is almost as powerful as the Nintendo Entertainment System. With the exception of the Pokemon Mini, it was the last 8-bit console made by a mainstream company. The last game released for Game Boy Color was Harry Potter And The Chamber of Secrets in 2002.

The GBC has a color screen rather than a monochrome, but it is not backlit. It is clearly thicker and bigger and has a slightly smaller screen than the Game Boy Pocket, its last model in the Game Boy line. As with the original Game Boy, it has a 8-bit processor made by Sharp Corporation that is a hybrid between the Intel 8080 and the Zilog Z80. The spelling of the system's name, Game Boy Color, remains used throughout the world, with its American English spelling of "color".

The Game Boy Color is part of the fifth generation of video game consoles. The GBC's competitors in Japan were the grayscale 16-bit handhelds, Neo Geo Pocket and the WonderSwan, though the Game Boy Color outsold them by a wide margin. SNK and Bandai countered with the Neo Geo Pocket Color and the Wonderswan Color, this did little to change Nintendo's sales. With Sega discontinuing the Game Gear in 1997, the Game Boy Color's only competitor in the United States was its last one, the Game Boy, until the short-lived Neo Geo Pocket Color was made in August 1999. The Game Boy and the Game Boy Color together have sold 118.69 million units worldwide making it the third-best-selling system of all time.

It was discontinued on March 23, 2003, shortly after the Game Boy Advance SP was made. Its best-selling game was Pokémon Gold and Silver, which sold 23 million units worldwide.

[[Hula]]

CATEGORIES: Dances, Culture of Hawaii

Hula is a type of dancing from Hawaii.

Hula is a word in the Hawaiian language.  Male dancers and female dancers can both dance hula. A long time ago, hula dance was used only in special ceremonies. Now, hula dance is mainly for entertainment. 

A hula dancer usually wears a grass skirt or a leaf skirt, a flower necklace (called "lei" in Hawaiian), and sometimes a flower in the hair.

Traditionally, the hula dancer dances to a chant (a poem that is sung to a rhythm). The chanter beats his or her hand on a gourd (dried, empty squash) to create the rhythm.

There are many kinds of hula dance. For example, the Hawaiian hula dance style is slow and the Tahitian hula dance style is fast.

[[Herakles]]

CATEGORIES: People in Greek mythology

Herakles (Ancient Greek: Ἡρακλῆς, Hēraklēs - “one glorified of Hera”) is a divine hero in Greek mythology. The greatest of the Greek heroes, Herakles was a demigod, son of Zeus and the mortal Alkmene as well as the twin brother of Iphicles. As a god, Herakles served as a paragon of masculinity, and was a patron of heroic endeavor. In Ancient Rome and the modern West, he is known as Hercules, with whom the later Roman emperors, in particular Commodus and Maximian, often identified themselves. The figure is most well known for his famous Twelve Labors, a series of seemingly impossible tasks he was made to complete in order to atone for the crime of murdering his family. As a culture hero, he was said to have started the Ancient Olympic Games and marked out the length of the Olympic stadium. He was the subject of much ancient and modern art, and remains a popular figure in modern times, being the subject of various films and television series, such as Walt Disney's Hercules.

[[Steam engine]]

CATEGORIES: Motors, Engineering

A steam engine is an engine that uses steam from boiling water to make it move. The steam pushes on the engine parts to make them move. Steam engines can power many kinds of machines including vehicles and electric generators. 

Steam engines were used in mine pumps starting in the early 1700s century and were much improved by James Watt in the 1770s. They were very important during the industrial revolution where they replaced horses, windmills and watermills to work machines.

The first steam engines were piston engines. The steam pressure pushed on a piston which made it move along a cylinder and so they had a reciprocal (back-and-forth) motion. This could move a pump directly or work a crank to turn a wheel and work a machine. They operated at low pressure and had to be very big to make a lot of power.

Steam engines were used in factories to work machines and in mines to move pumps. Later smaller engines were built that could move railway locomotives and steam boats.

The steam to power a steam engine is made in a boiler that heats water to make steam. In most places fire heats the boiler. Fuel for the fire may be wood, coal, or petroleum. Nuclear energy or solar energy may be used instead of fire. The steam coming out of the boiler applies the force on a piston. A valve sends the steam to one end of the piston, then the other, to make it move backwards and forwards. The moving piston pushes and pulls the piston rod, crosshead and connecting rod, to turn wheels or drive other machinery. The heavy spinning flywheel smooths out the power from the piston. The governor controls the speed of the engine.

Today many steam engines are still at work. During the 20th century the pistons were replaced by turbines which spin like a windmill pushed by jets of steam. These turn faster with more energy efficiency than the original kinds of piston steam engines. They are used in power plants to operate generators which make electricity. Some ships are also powered by steam turbines. The boilers of steam turbines can be heated by many different types of fuel, even a nuclear reactor in some power stations and warships.

[[Computer programming]]

CATEGORIES: Computer programming

Computer programming is the process of telling a computer to do certain things by giving it instructions. These instructions are called programs. A person who writes instructions is a computer programmer. The instructions come in different languages; they are called programming languages. There are many programming languages. Sometimes, programmers use special software, such as integrated development environments (IDEs), which have many special parts, including a text editor, to help them to type and edit programs.

Computers understand instructions directly if those instructions are written in machine code, special characters that can be processed by the computer but are difficult for humans to read. Writing these instructions directly in machine code takes a long time and is difficult, so instructions are written in a language easier for people to use, which the computer converts into "computer form" instructions (in other words, machine code) so the computer can follow them. The simplest of these is assembly language. Programs written in a language more like English are converted by a compiler. Some languages, called interpreted languages, use interpreters instead of assemblers or compilers.

Once a program has been compiled  the instructions in it are written into  a file that contains a series of numbers that the computer can understand.  These files are generally called These  machine-instructions will be loaded into the  memory computer's  so that the  can run them when the executable is opened. In the event that data is not transferred correctly, it can result in

[[Temperature record of the past 1000 years]]

CATEGORIES: Climate change

People measure modern temperature records using instruments. Records only cover the last 150 years or so. The temperature record of the past 1,000 years or more is found by using data from what are called "climate proxy" records. 

Proxies can be anything which relates to climate. Short term autobiographies often talk about the weather in past eras, and we do have some autobiographies from 2000 years ago. There are also tree rings and other methods which go back about 20,000 years. Further back still, there is evidence from geology, the record of the rocks. However, this page is just about the last 1000 years.

We are fairly sure there was a warm period about 1,000 years ago, and a cold period about the 17th century. Even in the 19th century people skated on the Thames in wintertime.

Although people today talk about climate change as if it were entirely man-made, this is not the complete picture. It is quite certain that climate has always been changing on Earth. Man-made changes are on top of changes which occur naturally. The Milankovich cycle is an important factor in these changes, and there are also changes in the heat put out by the Sun.

[[Camping]]

CATEGORIES: Camping, Tourism

Camping is a leisurivity, usually during summer when school children are on holiday, where people leave their homes and spend one or more nights outdoors.  Usually they seek nature, adventure, or a different environment.  They may sleep in a campervan or trailer, a tent, or in the open air in good weather.  Winter camping is less common but in some parts of the world, tents are people's homes year around. Rich people began camping for fun in the early 20th century. When more people could afford it, many more did it.

When camping, people usually prepare food to eat that is easy to make.  If they were hunting or fishing, they may cook the animal or fish they caught over a campfire.  

Dangers can arise, such as wild animals or illness from drinking unclean water.

[[Western New Guinea]]

CATEGORIES: Indonesia

Western New Guinea is the western half of the island of New Guinea. As of 2006, it is internationally recognised as Papua, a province of Indonesia. It was previously known by various names, including Netherlands New Guinea (until 1962), West Irian (1962-1973), and Irian Jaya (1973-2000). The incorporation of western New Guinea remains controversial in some quarters, including some within the area itself, and those who do not recognise the legal issues of Indonesia's claim to the area, calling it West Papua.

Papua was annexed by Indonesia under the controversial Act of Free Choice in 1969. In 2003, the Indonesian central government declared that the province would be split into three areas: Papua Province, Central Irian Jaya, and West Irian Jaya. Opposition to this resulted in the plan for Central Irian Jaya being scrapped, and even the designation of West Irian Jaya Province is still legally unclear. The independent sovereign state of Papua New Guinea (PNG) borders Papua Province to the east.

[[Maluku Islands]]

CATEGORIES: Melanesia, Islands of Indonesia

The Maluku Islands (also called the Moluccas, Moluccan Islands or simply Maluku) are an archipelago in Indonesia. They are part of the larger Malay Archipelago. They are on the Australian Plate, lying east of Sulawesi (Celebes), west of New Guinea, and north of Timor. The islands were also called the "Spice Islands" by the Chinese and Europeans. Other islands have also been called the Spice Islands.

Most of the islands are mountainous, some with active volcanos. The vegetation of the small and narrow islands, with their wet climate, is very luxuriant. It includes rainforests, sago, rice, and the famous spices; including nutmeg, cloves, and mace. Though originally Melanesian, the people of many island clans, especially in the Banda Islands, died in the 17th century. A second group of Malay people arrived in the early 20th century under the Dutch and this has continued in the Indonesian era.

Politically, the Maluku Islands formed a single province of Indonesia from 1950 until 1999. In 1999 the North Maluku (Maluku Utara) and Halmahera Tengah (Central Halmahera) regency were split off as a separate province. The islands are now divided between two provinces, Maluku and North Maluku. Between 1999 and 2002 they were known for fighting between Muslims and Christians, although both groups had previously been peaceful.

[[Domestication]]

CATEGORIES: Domesticated animals, Agriculture

Domestication is a change that happens in wild animals or plants, when they are kept by humans for a long time. The Latin term literally means "to make it suitable for home".

If humans take wild animals and plants and keep and breed them, over time the animals and plants may change. The animals and plants become dependent on the humans who keep them, and they change in ways that are better for human use. This change (domestication) happens by humans choosing which animals will breed the next generation. Biologists call this method artificial selection.

The first domestication of plants happened during the first use of agriculture. Humans first domesticated dogs. In the Neolithic revolution, people domesticated sheep and goats, and later cattle and pigs.

Domesticated plants are crops or ornamental plants. People use domesticated animals as livestock, that is for food, clothing, and work. Otherwise, the domesticated animals may be kept as pets.

Night of the Living Dead is a 1968 American horror movie directed by George A. Romero. It stars Duane Jones, Judith O'Dea and Karl Hardman. It premiered on October 1, 1968. It was completed on a US$114,000 budget. The film became a financial success, grossing $12 million domestically and $18 million internationally.

Night of the Living Dead was heavily criticized at its release owing to explicit content. It eventually garnered critical acclaim. It was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Film Registry as a movie deemed "culturally, historically or aesthetically significant. The movie is in the public domain due to an error by the distributor.

The story follows characters Ben (Duane Jones), Barbra (Judith O'Dea), and five others trapped in a lonely farmhouse in Pennsylvania which is attacked by unnamed "living dead" monsters which later became known in popular culture as zombies. Night of the Living Dead was the basis of five Living Dead movies (1978–2010) also directed by Romero, and has inspired remakes.

[[Russian Civil War]]

CATEGORIES: Wars involving Russia, Civil wars, Russian Revolution, 20th century in Russia

The Russian Civil War was a civil war fought from November 1917 to October 1922 between several groups in Russia. The main fighting was between the Red Army and the White Army. The Red Army was communist, and the White Army was anticommunist. Other forces fought against both groups or sometimes helped one of them against the other. Foreign countries such as Japan, the United Kingdom, France and the United States sent troops to help the divided White Army. The Red Army won the war because it was better-organized, more than united and held the best territory. After the war, the communists established the Soviet Union in 1922. 

Tsar Nicholas II, the traditional autocratic ruler of the Russian Empire, had just lost his throne in the February Revolution of 1917. Many regions of the Russian Empire were not stable Many groups had organized themselves to fight. The workers and the farmers supporting the communists organized themselves into the Red Army. People opposing them organized themselves into the White Army.

In Ukraine, some groups fighting for a free Ukraine organized themselves as the Green Army. There were several other groups. The Green Army and the smaller groups fought each other, and they sometimes fought the Red Army and the White Army.  Other nationalist armies fought for independence from any kind of Russian control. Finland, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia succeeded.

At the same time, some foreign countries were worried about the communists ruling the Russia. They feared that communism would come to their countries if the communists were successful and so they helped fight against the communists’ Red Army.

[[El Niño–Southern Oscillation]]

CATEGORIES: Weather events, Climate change

El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO in short) is a term for a natural event that takes place in the Pacific Ocean. It is also called El Niño and La Niña. In Spanish they mean "little boy" and "little girl".  

El Niño happens when the sea water temperature rises in surface waters of the tropical Pacific Ocean. Every two to five years the Pacific Ocean has this event. A weak, warm current starts around Christmas along the coast of Ecuador and Peru. It lasts for only a few weeks to a month or more. Every three to seven years, an El Niño event may last for many months. This can change the weather and have important effects around the world. Australia and Southeast Asia can have drought but the deserts of Peru have very heavy rainfall. East Africa can have both. In a La Niña event the weather patterns are reversed.

The Southern Oscillation was discovered by Sir Gilbert Walker in 1923. It is a "seesaw" of atmospheric pressure between the Pacific and Indian Oceans. There is an inverse relationship between the air pressure measured at two sites: Darwin, Australia, in the Indian Ocean and the island of Tahiti in the South Pacific. The Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) is the difference in sea-level pressure measured at Tahiti and Darwin. The Cold Tongue (CT) Index measures how much the average sea-surface temperature in the central and eastern Pacific near the equator varies from the annual cycle. The two measurements are anti-correlated, so that a negative SOI is usually together with an unusual warm ocean wind known as El Niño.

By the early 1980s it was clear that El Niño and the Southern Oscillation were related, and the acronym ENSO is used to describe this large-scale event.

The 2010-2011 Queensland floods were caused by a La Niña event which brought very heavy rain to the east coast of Australia. Other big floods in Australia have also happened during a La Niña, 1916, 1917, 1950, 1954-1956, and 1973-1975. The cost of the 2010-2011 Queensland floods has been worked out to A$30 billion.

[[Rhyme]]

CATEGORIES: Rhymes

Rhyme means words that sound the same or similar in their endings. Poems and popular song lyrics often use rhyme. A simple poem can also be called a rhyme.

Many examples of rhyme are in folk songs, children's songs, and of course in nursery rhymes. Rhymes at the ends of the lines in a song or poem are normal:

The counting song

uses "internal rhymes," rhymes that fall within a single line instead of at the end of lines. In another children's poem,

knack and whack give another example of internal rhyme. Also, the rhymes at the ends of the lines, bone and home, are not "exact rhymes."  Exact rhymes are the same in everything but the first sound. Exact rhymes are the most common type of rhyme and can be formed easily with common sounds in English:

Other rhymes are not exact but only similar:

Here, the rhymes are not exact rhymes. Also, gander and wander are "sight rhymes," words that look like rhymes when printed but do not sound quite alike. Sight rhymes are more common in poetry meant to be read, than in songs or verse meant to be sung or spoken aloud and heard by listeners.

Rhymes can be made up of more than one word, as in the short poem Rondeau by James Henry Leigh Hunt:

Along with simple normal rhymes, met and get, sad and add, and one internal rhyme, health and wealth, Hunt creates sets of clever two-word rhymes.

Some poets and writers use very unusual rhymes. Well-known examples are in the song lyrics to the 1939 MGM film version of L. Frank Baum's The Wizard of Oz. The lyrics, written by E. Y. "Yip" Harburg, use many odd rhymes, plus internal rhymes, complex rhyme patterns, and other tricks of language. W. S. Gilbert, the lyricist for the Gilbert and Sullivan comic operas, wrote the same way. The books of Dr. Seuss are also famous for their many strange rhymes.

Poets who choose to avoid rhyme write in blank verse or free verse.

[[Nuclear meltdown]]

CATEGORIES: Nuclear accidents

A nuclear meltdown describes a malfunction of a nuclear reactor. The term "nuclear meltdown" is commonly used by the public and by news media, but nuclear engineers usually refer to it as a core melt accident. A nuclear meltdown occurs when the middle portion of the nuclear reactor containing the fuel rods (its "core") is not properly cooled.   This can occur when the cooling system fails or is otherwise defective.  If this happens, uranium or plutonium or similar materials inside the nuclear reactor become hot and may start melting or dissolving.   It is this melting that is a nuclear meltdown. Due to decay heat, a nuclear meltdown can occur even in a reactor that is shut down. The uranium and plutonium liquified in a nuclear meltdown, mixed with fission products, melted zirconium from the fuel rod cladding, and other materials, is called corium. Corium is highly radioactive and remains hazardous for many centuries after a meltdown. The zirconium is a hazard because at high temperatures, it can react with the cooling water and make flammable hydrogen gas.

European colonization of the Americas started with an attempt by the Vikings who came from Scandinavia, the north end of Europe around the year 1000. They explored and settled awhile in the colony they called Vinland in what was later called Newfoundland. However, they abandoned it.

In 1492 Columbus rediscovered America. Soon Spanish conquistadores and many other Europeans went to stay. Different European countries took different territories, and fought over who should get which land. Natives died in great numbers. The survivors lost most of their land, and most learned the language of their conquerors.

[[Weather station]]

CATEGORIES: Meteorology

A weather station has machines that measure wind speed, wind direction, temperature, barometric pressure, and humidity of the air around them. There are many ways to do this with instruments such as barometers (air pressure), psychrometers (humidity), anemometers (wind speed) and cielometers (electronic, for cloud cover). Many weather stations have no people; they report their measurements automatically. 

[[Atmospheric pressure]]

CATEGORIES: Meteorology, Atmosphere

Atmospheric pressure is a force in an area pushed against a surface by the weight of the atmosphere of Earth, a layer of air.  The air is not distributed evenly around the globe.  It moves, and at different times, the layer of air is thicker in some places than in others.  Where the layer of air is thicker, there is more air.  Since there is more air, there is a higher pressure in that spot.  Where the layer of air is thinner, there is a lower atmospheric pressure. 

At higher altitude, the atmospheric density and pressure are lower.  This is because high places do not have as much air above them, pushing down.

Barometers can be used to measure atmospheric pressure. There is the same atmospheric pressure from all directions.  The  SI unit for pressure is hPa. Other units such as Bar (unit) and torr are used for various applications.

[[Asexual reproduction]]

CATEGORIES: Methods of reproduction

Asexual reproduction is reproduction without sex.

In this form of reproduction, a single organism or cell makes a copy of itself. The genes of the original and its copy will be the same, except for rare mutations. They are clones.

The main process of asexual reproduction is mitosis. This type of reproduction is common among some single-cell organisms, for example, Amoeba. Many plants also reproduce asexually, for example by means of runners. The individual zooids in a particular coral  or bryozoan are usually genetically identical. They are formed by asexual reproduction of the first individual to arrive in a place. One whole order of the rotifers, the bdelloid rotifers, has no sexual reproduction. Many types of living things have a double cycle. At one stage they have sexual reproduction, at another they simply multiply by splitting, or producing eggs which develop without fertilisation (aphids). All the daughters of the honey bee develop from unfertilised eggs. So, asexual reproduction is common in many forms of life.

Multilingualism is the ability to speak more than one language. The ability to speak two languages is "bilingualism," a type of multilingualism. Many immigrants are bilingual and speak languages of both their old and their new country. Multilingualism is useful in many kinds of work, partly because international trade is more common than in past centuries. Some countries and organizations having more than one official language hire people who speak more than one, so they can work with more people. 

Most people have a first language that they learned as babies. Other languages are usually learned much later.

Some linguists think there are more multilingual people in the world than monolingual people, who speak only one language

People who can speak several languages are called "polyglots". Those who can speak many, such as  Heinrich Schliemann and Ghil'ad Zuckermann, are called "hyperpolyglots".

The Khmer Rouge (Khmer: km; French for "Red Khmer") was a Stalinist, Maoist militant group in Cambodia. They took over the capital, Phnom Penh, on 17 April 1975. It was led by Pol Pot, who was called Saloth Sar before the take-over. They named the country Democratic Kampuchea. They immediately forced everyone out of the cities, effectively turning the whole country into a giant labor camp. They were defeated by the Vietnamese in January 1979. During the Khmer Rouge Years, many people were killed in a genocide comparable to the Holocaust. The exact number of people killed is unknown. Figures range from about 700,000 to about three million. Most people give figures between 1.4 million and 2.2 million, which would be 20-30% of the population of Cambodia, at the time. The international community continued to recognize the Khmer Rouge as the government of Kampuchea for a decade after they were defeated. Therefore, the Khmer Rouge held a seat in the United Nations until 1989.

Pol Pot died in his sleep in 1998. He was cremated without any ceremony. By 1999, the Khmer Rouge disbanded.

A leading source summarised the Khmer Rouge as follows:

"...The Khmer Rouge regime was the ultimate twentieth-century paradigm of the totalitarian state. Using sheer violence and terror, a small clique took power. saw itself as the messianic mission to bring happiness and prosperity faster than any of its revolutionary model and competitors. It came to control every aspect of social and private life. No one was allowed to nurse, let alone express, any form of opposition".

The same source summarises the effect: "Between 17 April 1975 and 7 January 1979 the death toll was about 25% of a population of some 7.8 million; 33.5% of men were massacred or died unnatural deaths as against 15.7% of the women, and 41.9% of the population of Phnom Penh".

[[Juche]]

Juche (juchesasang) is the group of ideas developed by North Korean leader Kim Il-Sung, Juche means self-reliance. According to its supporters, the idea was developed from Marxism and Leninism. In many cases, it is noticeably different from both. At its base, the idea states that the interests of the people and their nation are more important than those of Leninism or Marxism. A strong leader is required to undertake the necessary reforms. The nation of (North) Korea is special, and should be the focus of interest. Every nation needs to drive forward its own revolution. Three things are necessary for this:

It is the role of the state to make sure these three things are there. According to this idea, man himself is responsible for designing what the world should look like. The welfare of many people (which form the nation) is more important than the fate of the individual.

Juche also says that intellectuals are important.

Certain people have described these ideas as a philosophy, others see it as a religion.

Louis XVI (23 August 1754  21 January 1793) was the King of France from 1774 until 1792, when the monarchy was abolished during the French Revolution. His overthrow and execution ended a monarchy that was over 1,000 years old, although he was not the last French king.

Louis came from the House of Bourbon. He became the king at the age of 20, after the death of his grandfather Louis XV. Early in his reign, he tried to make France more modern. He stopped the government from using torture and allowed people to be Protestant again. He and his minister Turgot took away some laws on selling grain, which led to high grain prices in years when the harvest was bad. He also supported the Americans in their war for independence from Great Britain. Debts from this war, other war debts and the outdated tax system caused major money problems in France. Louis's plans to solve the problems were blocked by the nobles. The money problems and the new ideas of the Age of Enlightenment caused more people to stop supporting the existing monarchy (the Ancien Régime) and demand change.

In 1789, Louis called the Estates-General (a parliament) to try to solve the problems. As a leader who was weak-willed and did not want to change the country much, he soon disappointed the elected politicians who wanted to reduce the king's powers. Protests against the monarchy became more common, especially among the poorer people of Paris and the middle class. This led to the Storming of the Bastille in July and the Women's March on Versailles in October. These events caused the king to lose control of the country to the National Assembly.

At first, the Assembly did not plan to abolish the monarchy. But the idea became more popular as rebellions and protests broke out across France, more radical politicians started to lead the government, money problems became worse and foreign governments threatened to invade. Louis and his wife Marie Antoinette slowly became unpopular symbols of the Ancien Régime that people wanted to leave behind. Their failed escape from Paris in June 1791 was a disaster. It convinced many people that they were plotting with foreign governments to overthrow the Assembly. He was arrested during a riot in August 1792 and the monarchy was abolished the next month. The government took away his titles, calling him Citizen Louis Capet, taking the surname from Hugh Capet, an early French king. He was put on trial by the National Convention, found guilty of treason, and executed by guillotine on 21 January 1793. He was the only king of France to be executed.

Its geographic coordinates are 39°1′3.52″N, 125°45′48.05″E. It was made to celebrate the anniversary of Kim Il-Sung's 70th birthday. It is claimed that it was designed by Kim Jong-il.

The 170 meter (560') structure contains 25,550 blocks (365 × 70, one for each day of Kim Il Sung's life, excluding remainder days), dressed in white stone with seventy dividers and capped with a 20 meter high, 45 ton, shining torch allegedly made out of 'special materials'. It is possible to go to the top of the tower. It is said that the tower was built in 35 days and was dressed in 76 days.

In front of the tower is a 30 meter high statue consisting of three figures — one with a hammer, one with a sickle and one with a writing brush (an idealised worker, a peasant and a "working intellectual"). Also close to the tower is a wall of 82 friendship plaques, apparently from foreign supporters. Around the tower there are also pavilions and water features. It is claimed that the tower has become a popular place for North Koreans.

The tower is named after the principle of Juche, developed by Kim Il-Sung. The name of the tower is sometimes translated as the Tower of the Juche Idea or Juche Ideology Tower.

[[Space exploration]]

CATEGORIES: Space

Space exploration is a term which describes searching outer space. There are many reasons for space exploration. The most important reasons are for scientific research and the interest of humans to learn more about outer space. For centuries, humans had dreamt of reaching outer space. Better rockets made it possible in the 20th century. On October 4, 1957, the former Soviet Union launched the Sputnik 1, which was the first artificial satellite. This started the Space Race and people later went into orbit and Americans visited the Moon in Project Apollo.

Many space probes have gone to various planets and other places in the solar system to send back information about them. When people first went to space they didn't know how the effects of microgravity would have on humans so they sent animals instead. But in 1961 the soviets launched the first human into space, Yuri Gagarin.

Petr Čech (born 20 May 1982) is a retired Czech football player who is the technical and performance advisor as well as an emergency backup goalkeeper for Chelsea. He is thought by some players, journalists and managers as the greatest goalkeeper in the history of the Premier League  and, by many, as the greatest goalkeeper to have played for Chelsea. Currently, he plays as a goaltender for the London based ice hockey club Guildford Phoenix.

Čech was thought to be one of the best goalkeepers in the world. He had the record of the least losses in his first season playing for Chelsea and in the same season, he helped Chelsea to win the title of Premier League. He also helped Chelsea to win the same title the next year.

His first club was in his native country of Czech Republic. He stayed there for two years before moving to Sparta Prague. He stayed there for one season.

[[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]]

CATEGORIES: 1881 births, 1938 deaths, Deaths from cirrhosis, Disease-related deaths in Turkey, Presidents of Turkey, Thessaloniki, Speakers of the Parliament of Turkey

Kemal Atatürk (or alternatively written as Kamâl Atatürk, Mustafa Kemal Pasha until 1934, commonly referred to as Mustafa Kemal Atatürk; 1881 – 10 November 1938) was a Turkish field marshal and statesman who became the first President of Turkey from 1923 until his death in 1938. 

He is known for being a leader who freed his people from being controlled by other countries and later for starting changes that founded Turkish nation state based on social and economic nationalism, more modern and similar to Western civilization, mainly France (such as the French model of secularism called laïcité).

Atatürk was born under the name Mustafa in 1881. His birth place was in Salonika, Macedonia (now Thessaloniki, Greece). Salonika was part of the Ottoman Empire at that time. He took the name Kemal as a schoolboy and Atatürk (which means Father of the Turks) when he was president. His father's name was Ali Rıza Efendi. His mother's name was Zübeyde Hanım. He also had a sister whose name was Makbule (Atadan). He became an army officer and the most successful general officer of the empire in World War I, fighting in Gallipoli.

When the Ottoman Empire was ended after the war, Atatürk organized a nationalist movement that created the new, secular, Republic of Turkey. This meant that the country's government was no longer led by hereditary or religious leaders. Visitors to Turkey are often surprised by the importance given to Atatürk in present-day Turkey.

Few countries have such a person in their history. He was a successful military commander, and later established a democratic constitution and put in place changes that set Turkey on the road to becoming a new and developing nation. He inspired many later leaders like Habib Bourguiba, Gamal Abdel Nasser, Sukarno, and Muhammad Ali Jinnah.

His six principles still serve today as a sign post for establishing a democratic government:

[[Manhole]]

CATEGORIES: Construction, Street furniture

A manhole (also called a utility hole, cable chamber, maintenance hole ,  inspection chamber,  access chamber or confined space) is a hole for a person to go into to fix underground services. Some examples of these are sewers, telephone, electricity, storm drains and gas.  

The opening is protected by a manhole cover. A manhole cover can also be called a "biscuit". It is designed to stop people falling down the hole and to stop people going underground if they are not allowed to. Manholes usually have metal or polypropylene steps on the wall to make it easier to get into the manhole.

Manholes are usually found in urban areas, in streets and sometimes under sidewalks. They are usually circular to stop the manhole cover from falling into the hole.

[[Sewer]]

CATEGORIES: waste

Sewers are underground pipes that take away dirty water and human waste from homes, offices and many other places.  The sewers lead to sewage treatment plants that remove the harmful and unwanted parts, returning clean water to the environment.  Many rules and regulations exist for how clean the final discharge (effluent) must be.  

Cleaning crews use special trucks and tools to help keep the sewers clear of grease, tree roots, and other blockages. More rural areas may have septic systems where sewers do not yet exist.  In many urban areas, street gutters to carry rainwater are combined with sewers. 

[[Pajamas]]

Pajamas (pyjamas in the United Kingdom) are loose clothes that people wear while they are sleeping. Pyjamas usually include trousers and a shirt. Pyjamas are often made of cotton. They are usually worn without underwear. The word comes from पजामा, Pajāmā; پايجامه. Pajamas are often worn without underwear.

[[Barter]]

CATEGORIES: Commerce, Money

Barter is trading one thing for another without using money. Usually the things that are traded are worth the same amount of money, but no money is used in the trade.

Barter is useful when two people each have something the other wants, so they agree on an amount of stuff and then swap it. This can also happen with services, for example a plumber can fix a tap in a winery and be given a crate of wine.

The problem with barter is one person may not want what the other person has. For instance,  Bob needs a new pair of shoes and John has those shoes. But Bob has eggs and John needs milk. This is where money becomes useful because anything can be traded for a set amount of money. Bob could pay John for the shoes and John could go to the store and buy some milk.

For its work Organization of American States (OAS) uses four languages: English language, French language, Portuguese language, and Spanish language.

Many people and politicians of different countries of North America and South America had thought of an organization of their countries. These countries have also formed different organizations from time to time. Beginning from 1889-1890, these countries held meetings known as the International Conference of American States. At its first conference, 18 countries formed the International Union of American Republics.

In 1910, these countries held the Fourth International Conference of American States at Buenos Aires. They changed the name of the International Union of American Republics to the Union of American Republics. These countries held the ninth International Conference of American States between March and May 1948 at Bogotá. On 30th April 1948, 21 countries signed an agreement. They called this agreement the Charter of the Organization of American States. This was the beginning of the Organization of American States (OAS). OAS started functioning from December 1951.

The Charter of the OAS states the goals for forming the OAS. There are many goals. Some important goals relate to peace and security for these countries; development of democratic governments; and economic cooperation.

His most famous work is The Planets (1918). This is a suite of seven movements for orchestra, each about a different planet (the Earth is not included, and Pluto had not yet been discovered). The music does not really describe the planets, it describes the Roman gods after which the planets are named.  Mars, for example, is the “Bringer of War”. It has a very exciting rhythm with five beats in a bar. Jupiter has a tune which has become famous as the hymn “I Vow to Thee, My Country”. He died of heart failure in London.

[[Livestock]]

CATEGORIES: Domesticated animals, Agriculture

Livestock are domestic animals that are kept by people. Their uses are for meat, milking, wool, leather, or labor. Taking care of livestock is animal husbandry. Some types of livestock are: cattle, pigs, sheep, goats, and chickens. Chickens produce eggs; pigs produce meat; cattle, goats and sheep create milk, and sheep also create wool. Horses, cattle, camels, llamas, water buffalo, and other large animals do work for people, such as pulling wagons and other vehicles.

The breeding, keeping alive, and killing of livestock is called animal husbandry. Animal husbandry have been practiced by humans for a long time. There are different animal husbandry practices used by different cultures. It is an important part of the economy and culture of many countries.

Intensive animal farming, which is sometimes called "factory farming" is mostly used today. 99% of livestock in the US are now raised with intensive animal farming. Intensive animal farming increases the amount of things we can get from the livestock but it has also led to bad effects on animal welfare, the environment, and public health.

[[Breed]]

CATEGORIES: Animal husbandry, Genetics

A breed is a domesticated race or type of an animal or plant. The term may also be used as a verb. In this way, to breed an animal is to make sure that it has descendants that improve the next generation’s qualities. This is also often referred to as breeding. A breeder is a person who maintains and creates different breeds of animals or plants. Methods include inbreeding and crossbreeding.

[[Storm]]

CATEGORIES: Severe weather

A storm is a violent meteorological phenomena in which there is heavy rain, and wind due to moisture in the air. Hail and Lightning are also common in storms. More rarely, Tornadoes can occur in storms. 

Hurricanes, typhoons, and tornadoes are, often, called storms too but they have special names because they are very, very strong. Storms are studied by scientists called meteorologists. The idea of shipping forecasts started with a concern to save ships from unexpected storms in the North Atlantic. A storm is associated with severe weather and may be marked by strong wind,  thunder, lightning and heavy precipitation such as ice. Therefore, the knowledge of the weather condition is extremely important.

There are many varieties and names for storms: icestorm, blizzard, snowstorm, ocean-storm, firestorm, etc. The storms called thunderstorms develop in hot, humid tropical areas like India very frequently. The rising temperatures produce strong upward rising winds. These winds carry water droplets upwards, where they freeze, and fall down again. The swift movement of the falling water droplets along with the rising air create lighting and sound. 

[[Hemisphere]]

CATEGORIES: Hemispheres

Hemisphere means half (hemi) of the Earth (sphere).

[[Pressure]]

CATEGORIES: Measurement

Pressure means how much force something is pushing on something else with.

It is expressed as force acting per unit area: 

P = F / A 

(Pressure = Force divided by Area that force is acting on) 

It can also be defined as thrust (compressive force acting perpendicularly to the surface of a body) acting per unit area.

Pressure is directly proportional to force and inversely proportional to area., so the same amount of force applied by a hand will produce less pressure than when applied by something smaller, like a finger. 

It is important to understand the distinction between pressure and force. Body A may exert a much larger force on a surface than body B, but if that force is spread out over an area larger than that of body B, the pressure exerted will be less than that of body B. More force is not always equal to more pressure, and vice versa 

Pressure is also related to density. If a solid or a fluid is more dense, it has a larger weight, and therefore exerts a larger force, over the same area.

The SI unit of pressure is the Pascal (Pa) named after French physicist Blaise Pascal, who did much work on pressure. 1 pascal = a force of 1 newton per square meter. To measure much larger and much smaller pressures, sub-multiples of the unit, such as kilopascal and megapascal exist.

Atmospheric pressure is the pressure exerted by oxygen and other molecules (the atmosphere basically) on a body/point/area at sea level, and is equal to approximately 100000 Newtons or 100Kn.Atmospheric pressures is measured using instruments such as the barometer which uses the principles of pressure and vaccum to measure the atmospheric pressure.

[[Crocodilia]]

CATEGORIES: Crocodilia

The Order Crocodilia is a group of Archosaur reptiles. There are three living families.

Crocodiles are the nearest living relatives to birds, because they are both survivors of the Archosaurs.

Crocodiles are first found in the Upper Cretaceous period. They are descendents of a much wider group of Archosaurs called the Crocodylomorphs. These, in the Upper Triassic, were slender land-living forms, the sister group of the dinosaurs. 

The Crocodylomorphs, in turn, were part of an even larger group, the Crurotarsi, which are first seen early in the Triassic.

[[Biometrics]]

CATEGORIES: Anatomy, Authentication methods

Biometrics is a field of study which aims to identify or recognise people based on traits they have. Given these traits, a system can be trained to recognise certain people, with a certain probability. Better training usually lowers the probability of falsely identifying someone. 

The traits used are of two types:

Most often, the two types are combined, as in voice or signature recognition. Most of these biometrics are seen as "behavioral", but some are linked to the physiology, e.g. of the vocal tract, or of the hand. 

A person  may be identified by a fingerprint, or by letting the person sign a document.  The data could then be kept.  Someone who is checking can again take the fingerprint or the signature, and compare it to the old version.

When selecting features, those choosing must also look at social acceptance. Taking a fingerprint may be ok, taking a blood test may not be. Some biometric data is also easier to fake, e.g. signatures.

Also, when voice samples are taken, these may be distorted (worsened), because only a telephone line is available. Telephone lines cut off some bandwidth from the signal.

Other than for passports, biometric methods are also used in some banks.

[[Bandwidth (signal processing)]]

CATEGORIES: Internet, Mechanical vibrations, Radio technology, Electronics

Bandwidth is used to measure electronic and other types of communication. This includes radio, electronics, and other forms of electromagnetic radiation, Bandwidth is the difference between the electronic signal having highest-frequency and the signal having the lowest-frequency.

In computer networks, bandwidth is often used as a term for the data transfer bit rate.  More easily, the amount of data that is carried or passed from one point to another in a network, in a given time period (usually a second).  

[[Hertz]]

CATEGORIES: Units of measurement

The hertz (symbol: Hz, definition: 1/s) is a unit derived from time which measures frequency in the International System of Units (SI). Frequency is how often something happens. A frequency of 1 hertz means that something happens once a second. The note Middle C (the C in the middle of the piano) is 261.65 (262) Hz. This means there are 262 vibrations every second, which is heard as the note Middle C, when that piano key is played.

Humans are able to hear sounds between 20-20 000 Hz. Owls are able to hear sounds between 200–12000 Hz.

The basic unit is 1/second. The unit is named after a German physicist Heinrich Rudolf Hertz.

The Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) is the confederation of countries that used to form the Soviet Union. On December 8, 1991, leaders of Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine met at the nature reserve called Belovezhskaya Pushcha in Belarus. They discussed the creation of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) in place of the Soviet Union. They reached an agreement about many points and signed a document creating the CIS. One of these points stated that the alliance would be open to all the republics of the Soviet Union. Other nations with similar goals could also join the CIS.

The Soviet Union had 15 republics: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Georgia, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. On 6th September 1991, the Soviet Union had recognized the independence of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. Out of the remaining 12 republics, all (except Georgia) joined the CIS. Before joining the CIS, on 21st December 1991, leaders of these 11 countries had met in Kazakhstan to accept the original CIS agreement of 8th December 1991. Because Ukraine did not ratify the CIS agreement in the national parliament, it never became an official member of the CIS, but nevertheless participated as a de facto member. In December 1993, Georgia also joined the CIS. On 26th August 2006 Turkmenistan left the permanent membership, and became an associate member. On 15th August 2008 Georgia left the CIS membership, and Georgia's CIS membership officially ended on 17th August 2009. On 19 May 2018, Ukraine, which stopped participating in CIS in 2014 because of its conflict with Russia over Crimea and the Donbass, formally ended all participation in CIS.

With the creation of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), the Soviet Union ceased to exist. It was the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Many consider that with CIS, Russia continues to have some control over the former republics of the Soviet Union. 

The CIS has its headquarters at Minsk, Belarus. An Executive Director heads the CIS. The CIS is not a successor country to the Soviet Union. The CIS is an organization or alliance of independent countries. It is more like the European Community. The member countries of the CIS had also signed many agreements for economic cooperation and defense cooperation. They have signed other agreements for cooperation in foreign policy and other matters.

[[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]]

CATEGORIES: 1967 establishments in Asia, ASEAN

The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is an international organization. On 8th August 1967, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore, and the Philippines formed the ASEAN. At that time, communism was growing in Vietnam, and these five countries were also facing problems inside their own countries. In this background, these five countries created ASEAN as a show of common display of cooperation. In short, the purpose of the organization is political and economic cooperation. The organization is headquartered in Jakarta, Indonesia.

There had been an earlier organization called the Association of Southeast Asia (ASA). It was an international organization of Philippines, Malaysia, and Thailand. These three countries had formed ASA in 1961. It was named because all the countries in it are a part of Southeast Asia.

In 1976, the ASEAN countries held a conference in Bali. After this, these countries started closer economic cooperation. But, by the mid-1980s, the activities of the ASEAN had slowed down. By 1991, Thailand proposed a free trade area. The ASEAN countries meet every year to talk about many matters.

Originally there were only five members of the ASEAN. Brunei Darussalam joined the ASEAN on 7 January 1984. Vietnam joined the ASEAN on 28 July 1995. Laos and Myanmar joined the ASEAN on 23 July 1997. Cambodia became a member on 30th April 1999. East Timor is the only Southeast Asian country that is not a member of ASEAN. However both East Timor and Papua New Guinea (which is not considered geographically a part of Southeast Asia) are observers of ASEAN and wish to become full members of ASEAN.

Some information about ASEAN countries is as follows:

The ASEAN countries had created an ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF). 27 countries are members of the ASEAN Regional Forum. The leaders of these countries meet and talk about various matters, especially security and economic cooperation. The current members in the ARF are: Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore, Philippines, Vietnam, Brunei, Laos, Myanmar, Cambodia, Australia, Canada, the People's Republic of China, the European Union, India, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Mongolia, New Zealand, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Russia, East Timor, United States, and Sri Lanka.

The ASEAN holds a meeting every year. The meeting lasts for 3 days, and the members discuss many things.

[[Electric motor]]

CATEGORIES: Motors, Electricity

An electric motor changes electrical energy into mechanical movement.  A dynamo or an electric generator does the reverse: it changes mechanical movement into electric energy.  Most electric motors work by using the force of magnetism.  Electrostatic motors have also been used. 

Machines using electric motors include: fans, washing machines, fridges, pumps, and vacuum cleaners.

[[Explosive material]]

CATEGORIES: Explosives

Explosives are chemical compounds that cause explosions; they flare up and burst with a loud sound. Explosive material has many special characteristics: it is a chemically unstable material, it changes its form very fast and, while changing its form, it explodes by bursting and making loud sounds. 

There are two types of explosives: low explosives and high explosives. This classification depends on their rate of explosion. Low explosives conflagrate (= burn very fast). High explosives detonate (= explode with bursts). A low explosive is a material, which burns very fast, but does not explode generally. For exploding them, people mix them with high explosives. Sometimes, even a low explosive may detonate. A high explosive bursts and explodes very fast. High explosives produce more pressure than low explosives but low explosives are more safe to use. People use low explosives in fuses, rocket engines and fireworks, and high explosives in mining and demolition (destroying old bridges and buildings). Guns use low explosives as propellants; most bombs use high explosives. 

Gunpowder and ammonium nitrate are low explosives.

High explosives may belong to different groups: primary explosives and secondary explosives. Primary explosives are very unstable and rapidly react to shock, friction, and heat. Any shock, friction, or heat makes primary explosives to burn or blast fast. Secondary explosives are much more safe to use and do not react very fast to shock, friction, and heat. Any shock, friction, or heat may burn such explosives, but not make them to burst and blast. Some people call secondary explosives as base explosives. Some people also tell about another group of explosives. These are tertiary explosives. These explosives do not react to shock, friction, and heat. For explosion, tertiary explosives may need a mixture with secondary explosives. 

Primary explosives are used as detonators: that is, to cause the secondary explosives to explode. Mercury fulminate, picric acid, lead azide, nitroglycerine and iodine nitride are examples of primary explosives. TNT, dynamite, hexogen, HMX and Torpex are examples of secondary explosives.

While sending explosives from one place to another, the packs containing different types of explosives may have different types of markings on the boxes. The United Nations has advised use of such markings. Some examples are:

[[UNICEF]]

CATEGORIES: United Nations, Charities

The United Nations Children's Fund or UNICEF is an international organization. The United Nations established UNICEF on 11 December 1946. At that time, its name was United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund. Thus, UNICEF became its short name. In 1953, United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund dropped the words Emergency and International from its name. Its name became United Nations Children's Fund. But, in short, its name continued as UNICEF. 

The current Executive Director of UNICEF is former United States National Security Advisor Anthony Lake since 2010.

UNICEF has its headquarters in New York, United States of America. UNICEF provides many types of assistance and help to children and mothers. It receives money from different governments and private persons. It works in almost 190 countries

[[German reunification]]

CATEGORIES: 1990 in Europe, 1990s in Germany, Democracy movements, Nationalism

German reunification (German: Deutsche Wiedervereinigung) is a term of history. Unification means making two or more parts as one. The German reunification is the unification of the two parts of Germany.

After the Second World War, Germany had been divided into two countries. One was the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG), also called "West Germany". The other part was the German Democratic Republic (GDR), which was also called "East Germany". The German reunification was on 3 October 1990, when the East German states became a part of the Federal Republic of Germany.

[[Partitions of Poland]]

CATEGORIES: History of Poland

The Partitions of Poland or  Partitions of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth is a term used in history. They took place in the second half of the 18th century and ended the existence of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Three partitions of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth took place:

The partitions were carried out by Prussia, Russia and Habsburg Austria dividing up the Commonwealth lands among themselves.

The less often used term "Fourth Partition of Poland" may refer to any later division of Polish lands, specifically:

[[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]

CATEGORIES: 1795 disestablishments, Former republics, Former state unions, History of Belarus, History of Lithuania, History of Poland, History of Ukraine, 1569 establishments, 1790s disestablishments in Europe

The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, formally known as the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and, after 1791, the Commonwealth of Poland, was a state of Poland and Lithuania that was ruled by a common monarch. The Commonwealth was an extension of the Polish-Lithuanian Union, a personal union between those two states that had existed from 1386. It was the largest and countries of 16th- and 17th-century Europe and had one of the largest populations. The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth covered more lands than the present lands of Poland and Lithuania since it covered also all of present-day Belarus, a large part of present-day Ukraine and Latvia, and the west of present-day Russia.

The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth had high levels of ethnic diversity and religious tolerance. However, the amount of religious freedom varied over time.

After several decades of prosperity, it entered a period of political, military and economic decline. The Commonwealth ended with the final Partitions of Poland in 1795. Its growing weakness led to it being divided by its more powerful neighbours: Austria, Prussia and the Russian.

[[Unification of Germany]]

CATEGORIES: 19th century in Germany, Nationalism

The Unification of Germany occurred in the 19th century. Until then, there had been many states in Central Europe. Some of them were very small, possibly no more than 5 from one border to the other. Many Germans wanted a nation that would be united, powerful and influential.

The unification took place on January 18, 1871. After the Franco-Prussian War, the German princes proclaimed the German nation in Versailles, France, at the Hall of Mirrors. The unification joined together many independent German states, which became the German Empire. Otto von Bismarck, Prime Minister of Prussia, became Chancellor of the Empire.

The unification of Germany had begun many years earlier, during the Napoleonic Wars. At the Battle of Leipzig in 1813, which is also called the Battle of Nations, many of the German states joined Russia, Sweden and Austria to defeat Napoleon's army. In 1815,  the Congress of Vienna ended the Napoleonic Wars. Austria remained the most politically-powerful German state.  Prussia emerged as Austria's political and diplomatic rival.

There were many problems in unifying the German states. Not all politicians wanted unification. Some feared that it would give Austria and Prussia too much power among the many states. There were also problems in deciding who would collect taxes and how much was be paid.

[[OPEC]]

CATEGORIES: International organizations

OPEC, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries  is an international organization. Since 1965, the headquarters of OPEC has been in Vienna, Austria. OPEC was established in Baghdad, Iraq on 10–14 September 1960.

Its work is to "coordinate and unify the petroleum policies" of its members, and also to "ensure the stabilization of oil markets in order to secure an efficient, economic and regular supply of petroleum to consumers, a steady income to producers, and a fair return on capital for those investing in the petroleum industry".

According to the United States Department of Energy Energy Information Administration (EIA), OPEC crude oil production is an important factor affecting global oil prices. OPEC sets production targets for its member nations and generally, when OPEC production targets are reduced, oil prices increase.  Projections of changes in Saudi production result in changes in the price of crude oil.

OPEC was formed in 1960 when the international oil market was largely dominated by  multinational companies known as the 'seven sisters'.503 The formation of OPEC was a turning point in state control over natural resources.505 In the 1960s OPEC made sure that oil companies could not unilaterally cut prices.505 In December 2014, OPEC and the oil men were named in the top 10 most influential people in the shipping industry by Lloyds.

[[OECD]]

CATEGORIES: Think tanks, International organizations, Economics organizations, 1948 establishments

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is an international organisation of countries. Member countries of OECD all have a democratic system of government. They also accept the principle of a free economy. A country has a free economy when its government does not control the economic activities of its citizens and companies. 

The OECD started 1948 as the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation (OEEC). The Second World War had just ended three years before in 1945. Some countries of Europe came together to form OEEC to help each other re-build their industry and other things destroyed in the Second World War. Later on, some non-European countries also joined this organisation. In 1960, OEEC changed its name, and it became OECD: the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.

The OECD's headquarters are at the Château de la Muette in Paris.

OECD has thirty-eight member countries, of which 19 became members in 1961. These countries are:

19 countries joined OECD after 1961. The names of these countries (with the year they joined in brackets), are: 

[[1973 oil crisis]]

CATEGORIES: 1973, Arab–Israeli conflict, Economic history

The 1973 oil crisis started on October 17, 1973. when the members of Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC) said, because of the Yom Kippur War, that they would no longer ship petroleum to nations that had supported Israel in its conflict with Syria and Egypt (The United States, Canada, its allies in Western Europe, and Japan). The embargo was lifted in March 1974.

About the same time, OPEC members agreed to raise world oil prices, after attempts at negotiation with the "Seven Sisters" oil company earlier in the month failed. Due to the dependence of the industrialized world on crude oil and the role of OPEC as a major supplier, these price increases hurt the economies of the targeted countries, while at the same time limiting economic activity. The targeted countries responded with new, and mostly permanent, attempts to limit any more dependency.

During this time, many other problems arose. These problems badly affected the economy of the world. The problems continued even after 10 years until the early 1980s. The higher oil prices continued until 1986. Japan did well soon after the 1973 oil crisis. For example, Japanese companies started manufacturing automobiles that used less oil to run. Soon many other automobile companies in different countries also started to manufacture automobiles that used less oil to run. The Japanese also began focusing on producing electronics such as transistor radios and televisions. This production is what helped the Japanese economy to bounce back after the shock of the oil crisis.

in November 1972, leaders of 35 countries met in Helsinki. In 1973, these countries set up the Conference for Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE). By the end of 1990s, communist governments in many countries had changed. In this situation, the role of CSCE was also changing. The leaders from member countries of CSCE met in Paris. On 21st November 1990, they signed an agreement. This changed the name of Conference for Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) to Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). This international organization continues to function.

When normal people talk about paraphilia, they usually mean non-mainstream sexual behaviour.

Homosexuality (LGBT) used to be considered a paraphilia, but this is no longer the case in a lot of countries. However, in a lot of other countries it is still considered abnormal. The opposite of paraphilia is normophilia. An example of a normophilia is teleiophilia.

Nupedia was an English-language  online encyclopedia. Its articles were written by volunteers and checked by experts. They were licensed as open content. It was founded by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger. Nupedia was online from March 2000 until September 2003. It is mostly known as the website which came before Wikipedia.

Unlike Wikipedia, Nupedia was not a wiki. It also had a long peer-review process for all of its articles. This was supposed to make its articles as good as professional encyclopedias. Nupedia wanted scholars to help build it. Before it shut down, Nupedia had 25 articles that completed its own review routine.

In June 2008, CNET said that Nupedia was one of the greatest closed websites in Internet history.

[[Article (grammar)]]

CATEGORIES: Parts of speech, Basic English 850 words

An article is a word that comes before a noun. There are two kinds of articles: definite articles and indefinite articles.

In English there is just one definite article: "the". There are two indefinite articles: "a" and "an". The word "an" is used before a word starting with a vowel sound (not necessarily a vowel letter): we say "a horse", "a child", "a European" (European has a "Y" sound, /j/, which is a consonant sound), "a university", but "an orange", "an elephant". 

Some languages have more than one word for "the". In some languages, this is because each noun is either masculine or feminine or, in some languages it can be masculine, feminine or neuter. For example: in French "le" is used for masculine nouns ("le jardin" - "the garden") and "la" for feminine nouns ("la table" - "the table"). "The" becomes "les" in front of plural nouns. The indefinite articles in French are "un" (masculine) and "une" (feminine). German, Dutch and Ancient Greek have masculine, feminine and neuter nouns, but in the case of Dutch the word for "the" is the same for masculine and feminine ("de") so you do not need to know which it is. The Māori language uses one word for "the" for when the subject or object to which the "the" refers is one in number, and uses another word for "the" when the subject or object to which the "the" refers numbers more than one.

There are also many languages that do not have articles. Some examples include Russian, Hindi, Japanese, and Chinese. When speakers of these languages are learning English, it is often difficult to explain to them what an article is because English speakers use them naturally. Even though these languages do not have articles, they still have grammatical features that allow them to show definiteness.

In general: "the" in English is used for something you already know about or have already been talking about. The word "a" is used when introducing a new idea:

"The tired woman was looking for her cat. Suddenly she saw the cat up a tree". (We are already talking about the cat. The tree is a new idea).

"The tired woman was walking along when she suddenly saw a cat up a tree". (She had not been thinking about cats until then).

Sometimes we do not need an article, for example when talking about something in general:

"The dogs do not bite" (meaning: dogs that you are thinking about).

"Barking dogs do not bite" (barking dogs in general).

[[Sarcasm]]

CATEGORIES: Human communication, Figures of speech

Sarcasm is a figure of speech or speech comment which is extremely difficult to define. It is a statement or comment which means the opposite of what it says. It may be made with the intent of humour, or it may be made to be hurtful.

The basic meaning is to be hostile under the cover of friendliness. The word's origin is Greek, sarcasmus, see sarchasaristic (Hobson 2018). However, it usually comes with a cue which helps the receiver to understand it. For example, a mother saying "Oh, that's clever!" when a child makes a mistake always signals her love with her tone of voice. Quite different when a hostile person says "Oh, here comes Mr Clever-clogs!". So a person learns how to decode the message.

Much more difficult it is when someone uses a neutral tone of voice, as in "deadpan" or "dry humor". Psychologists think such cases are basically hostile.

A point to remember is that it does not travel well in writing or translation.

[[Lie]]

Anemones are sessile. This means they like to stay in one area. They can move very slowly along the bottom.  Some types can swim to a new location by using flexing movements. Many species live in rockpools between high tide and low tide, and on rocky shores generally. Anemones can be found in deep oceans as well, and a few are pelagic.

An anemone has an oral disk on the top of its body. The sea anemone’s mouth and gut are in the middle of the oral disk. The tentacles surround the oral disk. The pedal disc is on the bottom of the sea anemone.

Some sea anemones live in symbiosis with other animals. clownfish, Incognito goby, and arrow crabs may shelter among the tentacles of the anemone. Hermit crabs often have sea anemones on the shell they live in. Some anemones have a symbiosis with a type of algae which lives inside them. This is the same thing many corals do. The dinoflagellate algae use sunlight to make food, and the anemone uses some of the food.

The first detailed investigation of sea anemones was a survey of those found on or near the beaches of the British Isles by the naturalist Philip Henry Gosse.

[[Polyp]]

CATEGORIES: Cnidarians

Polyps are one of two forms of the cnidarians. The other body form is the medusa. Polyps have a vase-shaped body with tentacles around the mouth opening.

Polyps may be sexual or asexual. They can all reproduce asexually by budding. In some species, the polyps can also reproduce sexually.

When medusae mate, the result may be polyps, when polyps replicate, the result may be medusae. The details vary between species. Some species are polyps all the time (such as Hydra, and the whole of the class Anthozoa (corals and anemones). 

In many cases the asexual buds formed do not separate from the parent but remain, thus forming colonies or 'stocks'. These may reach a great size, and contain a vast number of individuals. Slight differences in the method of budding produce great variations in the form of the colonies. The reef-building corals are polyp-colonies, strengthened by the formation of a firm skeleton.

Jellyfish (class Medusozoa) have two distinct life history stages (body forms) during their life cycle. The first is the polyp stage. Often, this polyp is attached to the sea floor, or to another hard surface. A polyp that lives that way is called sessile. 

In the second stage, the tiny polyps asexually produce jellyfish, each of which is known as a medusa. Tiny jellyfish swim away from the polyp and then grow and feed in the plankton. Jellyfish reproduce both sexually and asexually.

[[Dravidian languages]]

CATEGORIES: Dravidian languages

The Dravidian languages are a language family spoken by Dravidian peoples. The languages are mainly spoken in South India,  western Bangladesh, northern Sri Lanka and southern Pakistan. There are about 26 languages in this family. A total of about 215 million people speak Dravidian languages.

Dravidian languages were probably spoken over a larger area of the Indian subcontinent in the past. There are several ethnic groups in India known as "Scheduled Tribes" who still speak their own Dravidian languages. Brahui, with 2,200,000 speakers, is a Dravidian language spoken in the Balochistan region of Pakistan and Afghanistan. Dhangar, which is a dialect of Kurukh, is spoken in parts of Nepal and Bhutan.

[[East-West Schism]]

CATEGORIES: Christianity of the Middle Ages

The East-West Schism (sometimes also called Great Schism) describes how Christianity developed into two big branches in the Middle Ages. The Western part later became the Roman Catholic Church. The Eastern part is known as the Eastern Orthodox Church. During the centuries views on politics and theology developed differently in several ways. It is distinct from the earlier schism that separated Oriental Orthodoxy from the church that split in half later.

During the 5th and 6th Centuries the East and West became isolated from each other due to the invasions of the Balkan peninsula.  They also had different languages. Latin was the most important language in the West. The East mainly spoke the Greek language. Because of this, talking to each other was difficult. The West came under Frankish influence (as opposed to Byzantine) in the 700s.

These were just some of the issues plaguing the Eastern and Western Christians that led to the Great Schism. It seems that even after 1054 relations between the east and west were not completely unfriendly, and the common peasant was probably not immediately affected by the schism.

[[William III of England]]

CATEGORIES: 1650 births, 1702 deaths, Dutch royalty, House of Orange-Nassau, Kings and Queens of Scotland

William III and II (4 November 1650 – 8 March 1702) was King of England and Ireland from 13 February 1689 (as William III) and he was king of Scotland from 11 April 1689 (as William II). He remained king until his death on 8 March 1702.

William was born in the Netherlands as Prince William Henry of Orange. His mother was Mary Stuart. Mary was the sister of the King of England, James II, so King James was William's uncle. William married King James's daughter Mary (his own first cousin) on 4 November 1677.

The Protestant majority in  England did not like King James, and he was overthrown in the "Glorious Revolution" of 1688. William landed in England (at Brixham) with a Dutch army.

When William landed, James's support melted away. James was allowed to leave for France, and William became the last person to successfully invade England by force. The events are known as the Glorious Revolution. 

The English Parliament offered the English crown to William and Mary jointly (and when one died the other would be be monarch), making them William III and Mary II. This later came to be known as the reign of William and Mary. Laws were passed which protected Parliament from unreasonable acts of the Sovereign, guaranteed religious toleration to Protestant nonconformists, but restricted the religious liberty of Roman Catholics and non-Christian faiths.

William summoned a Convention of the Estates of Scotland in 1689 and sent them a conciliatory (~friendly) letter, unlike James, who had tried to give them orders.  On 11 April, the day of the English coronation, the Convention finally declared that James was no longer King of Scotland. William and Mary were offered the Scottish crown, and they accepted on 11 May. The Jacobites tried for over 50 years to have James and his heirs reinstalled.

William's enemy was the King of France, Louis XIV, who protected and supported James in his efforts to return. In Ireland, the majority Roman Catholics were reinforced by French forces led by Jacobites. William personally led his army to victory at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690. James fled back to France. 

There was next a Nine Years' War between a coalition led by William, and France. The Anglo-Dutch Alliance did well on sea and defeated a French fleet at La Hogue in 1692. On the other hand, the alliance lost Namur in 1692, and the Battle of Landen on land, in 1693.

Mary died on 12 December 1694 of smallpox, leaving William to rule alone. He was eventually succeeded by his sister-in-law, Queen Anne. One more fact is of great importance. In 1701 an Act of Parliament was passed which settled the succession of the thrones of England and Ireland on Protestants only. Scotland was not part of this arrangement until the parliamentary union of the two kingdoms in 1707.

[[Abigail Fillmore]]

CATEGORIES: 1798 births, 1853 deaths, First Ladies of the United States, Second Ladies of the United States, Millard Fillmore

Abigail Powers Fillmore (March 13, 1798 – March 30, 1853), was the wife of Millard Fillmore, the 13th President of the United States. She acted as the First Lady of the United States from 1850 to 1853.

She was born in Saratoga County, New York. Her father’s name was Lemuel Powers. Her father died shortly after her birth. After this, her mother moved away westward to less settled area. Abigail Powers had a brother also. Their mother gave them a good education with the help of her husband’s library. 

When Abigail Powers was around 19 years old and a student at an academy at New Hope, New York, she met Millard Fillmore. He was also studying in the same academy. They married in February 1826. In 1828, she had a son, named Millard Powers Fillmore. After few years, Fillmore bought a home in Buffalo, New York where she had a daughter, Mary Abigail. During the next few years, her husband was elected to the U.S. Congress. Her husband became a state comptroller. In 1849, her husband became the Vice President of the United States. The couple moved to the Washington, D.C.. After 16 months, President Zachary Taylor died. Millard Fillmore became the President and they moved into the White House.

During last several years, Abigail Powers had learnt to move in the high society. She did a fine role as the First Lady. 

She had a permanently injured ankle. This made standing difficult to greet guests. But, she still continued to act as the first lady. Later on, due to her bad health, she gave many routine duties of the First Lady to her daughter, "Abby." 

Abigail Powers could get a special sanction of money from the government. With this, she bought many books for the library at the White House. After her husband’s retirement, she attended the inauguration of President Franklin Pierce. She returned to her hotel room. Due to very chill weather, she became sick with pneumonia. On 30th March, 1853, she died of pneumonia. In her respect, the United States Congress adjourned (that is, stopped working) for that day, and government offices remained closed. She was buried at Buffalo. 

After about five years of her death, her husband married a widow named Caroline Fillmore of Buffalo, New York. Millard died on March 8, 1874. 

[[Myocardial infarction]]

CATEGORIES: Heart disease, Medical emergencies

An acute myocardial infarction, also called a heart attack, happens when a blood vessel in the heart suddenly becomes blocked. Blood vessels carry blood and oxygen. When a blood vessel in the heart gets blocked, blood cannot get to part of the heart. This part of the heart does not get enough oxygen. This is called ischemia. When the heart muscle becomes ischemic (does not get enough blood and oxygen), the ischemia often causes chest pain. This is called Angina Pectoris. If the ischemia lasts long enough, the heart muscle that is not getting enough oxygen dies. This is called an infarction. "Myocardial infarction" means "infarction (muscle death) in the heart muscle."

A heart attack is a medical emergency. The first few minutes are very important for keeping the person alive. Some of the damage from the heart attack can be repaired if the person gets treatment during the first hour of the attack.

Keith Richards (born 18 December 1943) is an English guitarist best known as a founder member of the Rolling Stones. He is mostly famous for his rhythm guitar playing, but he can also play lead guitar quite well. He often likes to use a guitar with only 5 strings — the lowest-tuned string is removed. On a small number of Rolling Stones recordings, he plays bass guitar, as well as other instruments. He sings background vocals on most Rolling Stones songs. Occasionally, he also sings lead vocals, on songs like "Happy", "Little T & A", and "The Worst".

Sir Edward William Elgar, 1st Baronet OM GCVO  (2 June 1857 - 23 February 1934) was the most famous English composer of his time. He composed in the late romantic era.

Elgar was born in Broadheath, Worcestershire. His father owned a music shop. Apart from having violin lessons Elgar taught himself about music. He studied the printed music in his father’s shop and often travelled with him when he went on his rounds to tune pianos. He heard a lot of cathedral music and often practised the organ. He took over his father’s job as church organist and soon became conductor of local orchestras and bands.

Worcester was a small town but the music there was good. The Three Choirs Festival took place there every third year. In 1884 he was playing the violin in the orchestra when the great Czech composer Dvořák was conducting.

In 1889 Elgar married. His wife Caroline Alice Roberts came from a family who had more money than the Elgars, and she was 8 years older than he was. Many people did not approve of the marriage, but she was a good wife to him and encouraged him in his efforts to be a successful composer.

In 1899 Elgar wrote an orchestral piece called the Enigma Variations. There is a main tune, and then a series of variations on the tune. Each variation describes one of his friends, but he did not say which friends they were: he only put their initials or nickname at the top of each variation. This is why the piece is an enigma (a “puzzle” or “secret”). People have managed to work out who each friend was, but the meaning of the main tune is still a puzzle. This music made Elgar very famous. 

The next work that he wrote is probably his greatest work: The Dream of Gerontius (1900). It is an oratorio. Gerontius is an old man who is dying and thinking about whether God will punish him for his sins or save him and take him to heaven. Elgar wrote two other oratorios: The Apostles and The Kingdom. He wrote two symphonies, a violin concerto, a cello concerto, Introduction and Allegro for Strings, Sea Pictures (five songs for mezzo soprano and orchestra) and chamber music including a violin sonata, a string quartet and a piano quintet.

Throughout his life his wife helped him by ruling neat manuscript lines on plain paper so that he could write his music. After she died in 1920 Elgar was so sad that he stopped composing. He died of colorectal cancer in Worcester.

Elgar’s most popular piece is the first of his Pomp and Circumstance Marches. It has the tune which is sung to the words “Land of Hope and Glory” and the audience always join in singing it at the Last Night of the Proms.

[[Printing press]]

CATEGORIES: Machines, Communication, Printing

The printing press is a machine for printing. It makes many copies of identical pages. The printing press today is used to print books and newspapers. It had a great influence on society, especially western society. It was "one of the most potent agents... of western civilisation in bringing together the scattered ideas of thinkers".

Woodcut printing has been done for several centuries. That was whole pages cut into wood, words and pictures. In the 15th century Johannes Gutenberg improved the process. He used separate alloy letters screwed into a frame. This way a large set of letters could make almost any page for printing. This process was called typesetting. Each letter was in a block of metal, fixed in a frame. He could then move paper and ink over it, much like a stamp. This method was called letterpress. The letters would leave ink on the paper in the shape of the letters, creating text or illustrations.

Bigger and much faster presses were invented in the industrial revolution. The main improvements were made in the 19th century. Two ideas altered the design of the printing press entirely. First was the use of steam power to run the machinery. Second was the replacement of the printing flatbed with the rotary motion of cylinders. Both were done by the German printer Friedrich Koenig between 1802 and 1818. Having moved to London in 1804, Koenig got financial support for his project in 1807.  In 1810, Koenig patented a steam press "much like a hand press connected to a steam engine".

Soon other inventions were added, such as the making of cheaper paper by using wood pulp instead of rags. Later in the 19th century came machines which speeded up typesetting, which was previously done by hand, letter by letter. A machine for hot metal typesetting was designed by Linotype Inc. It turned molten lead into type ready for printing.

Many further developments in printing happened in the 20th century. Today printing presses are controlled by special-purpose computers, and the material to be printed is prepared on computers. As a consequence of these inventions, the cost of printing has fallen significantly compared to other commodities. Now the price of a book or magazine is less determined by its  production, and more by other factors, such as marketing.

[[Mezzo-soprano]]

CATEGORIES: Vocal ranges

A mezzo-soprano is a female singer whose voice is a little lower than that of a soprano but not low enough to be called a contralto. There are many roles in opera that need a mezzo-soprano voice, for example the role of Carmen in the opera Carmen by Georges Bizet or Cherubino in Le Nozze di Figaro by Mozart. Famous mezzo-sopranos include: Marilyn Horne and Dame Janet Baker who have both now retired. Alice Coote and Susan Graham are famous mezzo-sopranos today.

[[Old age]]

CATEGORIES: Gerontology

Old age is when a person is near or beyond the usual life expectancy, usually from the age of 65 onwards.  Old people are usually retired from work and spend their time in other ways like helping take care of small children who are kin to them in some way. Often people of old age have wrinkly skin. They will move slower, and become constantly cold. 

Old people have more health problems than young adults, and many of them take medicine.  The reason for this is that their bodies are slowly deteriorating, so they have more problems, especially with moving. Osteoporosis weakens the bones, and is one of the problems that become more common with age. Others include blindness and deafness. Gerontology is the part of medicine that deals with these things.

Old people are also called "senior citizens" or "elders". Elders are considered to be wise because they have had much experience in their long lives. Many cultures view elders with respect and kindness, and depend upon them to pass down knowledge to the younger generations of people.

[[Counter-Reformation]]

CATEGORIES: Counter-Reformation

The Counter-Reformation was a movement within the Roman Catholic Church which began in the 1500s. It covered the following five areas:

The Counter-Reformation began after Martin Luther's Reformation. In reaction, Catholics  reaffirmed some points of faith that the Protestants' objections had put in danger. These included the validity of the seven sacraments.  The Protestants had reduced the sacraments to only two, Baptism and the Eucharist. Protestants deny the doctrine of transubstantiation, which is seen as making Mass less important. Some reformation era groups had rejected the Mass entirely.   Luther's view was somewhere between that of the more radical reformers and the Catholic view.  Luther wrote that without faith neither Baptism nor the Eucharist is sufficient for salvation.  The Counter-Reformation specifically re-affirmed the Catholic understanding of the mass. 

On other issues, Catholics effectively accepted some of the Protestant complaints. Penance  became a private confession and repentance from sin instead of outward actions. This served to correct the corrupt practice of selling forgiveness. This type of forgiveness, called Indulgence was the immediate cause of Luther's protests against abuses in the Catholic church. 

As a result of the Counter Reformation, other abuses, such as Simony were also greatly curtailed. Thus the Protestant movement served not only to create new expressions of the Christian faith, but also to correct problems in the Catholic church which led to its revitalization. 

Catholic missionaries, especially Jesuits went across the world to spread the Catholic faith. The Congregation of the Holy Office of the Inquisition was also created, to revitalize the work of suppressing heresy.

[[Decolonization]]

CATEGORIES: Politics

Decolonization is when a colony of any country becomes independent. Thus, decolonization is the opposite of colonization. Sometimes, a colony may not get full freedom, but may become part of another country or even the part of the country which colonized it. This is also decolonization. 

In some cases, decolonization may result after non-violent discussion. In a relatively small number of cases, decolonization happens only after armed struggle and revolt. Decolonization is different from the break-up of traditional empires like the Mongol Empire or the Ottoman Empire. Decolonization generally means independence of non-Europeans from European rule. Thus, the break-up of the Union of Sweden and Norway and the independence of Manchukuo from the Empire of Japan were not decolonization. Major decolonization occurred in the 20th century. It began with the independence of Pakistan and India in 1947 from the British Empire. Soon after, many countries of Africa became independent from the rule of many countries of Europe.

[[History of the Soviet Union (1985-1991)]]

CATEGORIES: 1980s in the Soviet Union, 1990s in the Soviet Union

The history of the Soviet Union from 1985 to 1991 covers the dissolution of the Soviet Union. (Dissolution means ending or splitting up) The dissolution of the Soviet Union describes its end as a separate country.

The Soviet Union had many regions called "republics". They all belonged to the Russian Empire before 1917. All these "republics" were part of the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union was one country. After its dissolution, all of the republics became independent countries. The names of these countries are: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Georgia, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania.

Russia is a special case, because it still has a number of former republics inside its borders. That is why the country is called the Russian Federation. There are eight Federal Districts and 83 so-called "Federal Subjects" of the Russian Federation. Siberia, for example, has two huge federal districts.

The Soviet Union ended with the formation of the Commonwealth of Independent States. At the time of dissolution of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev was the president of the Soviet Union. He was in this position for a little over a year but he was leader of the Soviet Union from March 11th 1985. On 25 December 1991, he quit the post of the president of the USSR. By 31 December 1991, all organizations and departments of the Soviet Union stopped working. On that date, the Soviet flag flew for the last time on the Kremlin.

[[European Convention on Human Rights]]

CATEGORIES: Human rights, Council of Europe, Treaties and Conventions

Countries, which are members of the Council of Europe agreed on certain points written in a document to ensure human rights written in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. These points became the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. In its shorter form it is European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). The Convention also established the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), and the sentence of this Court has a force legal power by its Article 46. 

The ECHR was written on 4 November 1950. 

The ECHR has made many protocols, for example: protocol 2nd for right to education, 12th against all discrimination also by public authority and 13th for complete abolition of the death penalty. Protocols are set of rules. All member countries must follow these rules. 

The ECtHR can give decisions on complaints or cases which come to it. If a person thinks that a European country has abused his or her human rights, that person may take the matter to the judges of ECtHR. The judges will listen to the complaint and give their decisions. These decisions must be followed by the governments of the countries.

[[European Court of Human Rights]]

CATEGORIES: Human rights, Council of Europe, Courts (law)

The European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) hears and decides particular type of complaints. These complaints relate to abuse of human rights. ECoHR’s other popular name is "Strasbourg Court". Member countries of the Council of Europe created ECoHR to arrange all such complaints, listen to the complaints, and to give decisions. European Convention on Human Rights tells about many human rights. ECoHR sees that people should enjoy all these human rights.

ECoHR' has a number of judges. The number of judges is seven normally but at the case of dealing a great issue, the number will be 21 and the judges are equally from member countries of the Council of Europe. At present, there are forty seven member countries of the Council of Europe. Each country may have one judge in the ECoHR. But, judges work independently for the ECoHR, and not for their country.

Żagań is a town in the west part of Poland. 26,665 people lived there in 2004.  It is the main town of part of Poland called Żagań County.  

It is now part of the in the Lubusz Voivodship (a Voivoidship is part of the way Poland is organised into areas), before it was in Zielona Gora Voivodship (1975-1998). There is a castle called Sagan in the middle of an area that is  also called Sagan. The castle belonged to Wallenstein, a soldier and politician of the Thirty Years' War. Later, the castle belonged to the Bohemian family of Lobkowitz.  In 1786, the Sagan area was bought by Peter Biron, duke of Courland. In 1843, it went to his daughter Dorothea, the wife of Edmond de Talleyrand.

An act of the king of Prussia on January 6, 1845 made her  Duchess of Sagan. Napoleon III did the same in France, for her son Louis.  The double title, both Prussian and French, meant that the duc de Sagan was a neutral party in the Second World War. His house (the Château de Valençay) was a safe place to keep pictures and other things from the Louvre when German soldiers were in France. 

In the Second World War, the well-known war prison Stalag Luft III was there.

El Chupacabra (or El Chupacabras) is a cryptid said to live in Puerto Rico, Mexico, Chile, Brazil, Anaheim California. Gilbert Arizona.   Texas to Florida, Michigan, Maine and even Oregon. Its name comes from the Spanish translation of "goat sucker", because of its habit of attacking and drinking the blood of livestock, including goats. The legend was started in 1987 when there was a huge, gruesome massacre of livestock all over. All the animals had two puncture wounds on their neck in which the blood had been drained.

[[Hydra (animal)]]

CATEGORIES: Cnidarians

Hydra (animal) are simple invertebrates, with two layers of body cells. They live in fresh water. Their body is radially symmetric. They have a central cavity through which they take in food and expel waste. 

As Cnidaria they have stinging cells on their tentacles. They are hydrozoa, and belong to the same order as other polyps. Most Hydra are microscopic in size. Hydras can be found in almost any unpolluted body of water. Hydras reproduce by budding. In budding, the offspring forms as a lump on the parent and eventually becomes big enough to break off and live by itself. They can move if they need to by a kind of slow somersaulting motion. 

Recent research has found they produce an antimicrobial protein hydramacin, which protects their outer layer from bacterial infection.

[[Clownfish]]

CATEGORIES: Perciformes

The clownfish is a kind of fish. Clownfish habitat usually is a coral reefs. Clownfish live in the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean, from north west Australia, the coast of South East Asia as far north as Japan. Often, they live in a symbiosis with other animals, for instance the sea anemone. They live in anemones which are like plants under the sea. Anemones eat fish by killing them with their tentacles which are poisonous. Scientists believe that clown fish are protected from the poison because they are coated in a type of mucus.

Some kinds of clown fish can grow up and reach 18 centimeters (7.1 inches). Sometimes clownfish only grow 10 centimeters (3.9 inches). They can be orange, yellow or they may look a little red.

Clownfish eat small invertebrates that are dangerous to the anemones. That helps the anemones and the clownfish. This is called mutualism.

Many people like having clownfish in their aquarium because they are some of the easiest salt water fish to keep and care. They became particularly popular after the film Finding Nemo. There are 28 species of Clownfish. Clownfish are born male but when they grow older some develop into females.

Bruce Lee (November 27, 1940 - July 20, 1978) was a Chinese American, Hong Kong actor, martial artist, martial arts instructor, philosopher, movie director, movie producer, screenwriter, and founder of the Jeet Kune Do martial arts movement.

Lee is famous for making martial arts popular in the United States in the 1970s, when he played in a series of movies. This included the first ever martial arts movie in the United States - called Enter the Dragon. This was the most successful and famous, which was released after Bruce's death. He died in 1973 during the production of a movie called, The Game of Death. The movie was not finished, although some completed section were later released. Almost 20 years later his son, Brandon Lee would also die while making a movie. Lee also taught other people martial arts, including actors Huggo Chairres, Steve McQueen, James Coburn, and basketball player Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. He inspired many other actors who are famous for using martial arts in their movies including Jackie Chan, Jet Li, and Chuck Norris. Jackie Chan had a small part in 'Enter The Dragon' and Chuck Norris co-starred in Way of The Dragon.

Lee starred in five movies, including The Big Boss, Fist of Fury (also known as The Chinese Connection and The Iron Hand), The Way of the Dragon (also known as Return of the Dragon), Enter the Dragon and The Game of Death.

He is noted for his major contributions to both the Hong Kong and American movie industry during the 1970s, his martial arts movement and innovative ideas (including Jeet Kune Do), his philosophy, and his physical fitness ability. He is considered to be a cultural icon and is considered to be one of the most influential martial artists ever by social critics and other martial artists alike.

On the night of July 20, 1978, Lee aged 37, died at his home from cerebral edema, which is a buildup of fluid around the brain. This is believed to have been caused by a reaction to painkillers he was taking for a back injury.

[[Plastic Ono Band]]

CATEGORIES: English rock bands

The Plastic Ono Band was a rock and roll band formed by Yoko Ono with husband (and former Beatle) John Lennon. They were active from 1969 until 1974.

Lennon and Ono recorded their first single together, titled "Give Peace A Chance", in a Montreal hotel with a roomful of guests, including Tommy Smothers, Allen Ginsberg, Norman Mailer, Timothy Leary, and the local Hare Krishna chapter. The pair were in an auto accident before the single was to debut (be played in public for the first time), and they had to stay in the hospital. Not wanting to cancel the debut, they sent the first version of their "new band" – a set of plastic cases that held the sound equipment – which played in their place. It was a strange kind of debut for a new band, but the song (a protest against the Vietnam War) became a minor hit that year, in England and in the United States.

The second version of the Plastic Ono Band included Ono and Lennon in person, along with musicians Eric Clapton, Klaus Voormann and Alan White. They performed together at a rock concert in Toronto in September 1969, and it was the first time Lennon had played in public with a band other than the Beatles. The show went well, and helped Lennon decide to leave the Beatles, which he had thought about doing for some time. A second single, "Cold Turkey", was recorded with this lineup.

After the Beatles ended, Lennon decided he did not want to have another permanent band, and he and Ono used the Plastic Ono Band name to refer to any musicians who appeared on the records they made together. Even listeners were called a part of the band, especially when the band gave a concert. An advertisement for one of their records included a page from a telephone book, and the words "YOU are the Plastic Ono Band".

Ono and Lennon separated for a time during 1973 and 1974. Lennon still used forms of the band name on the two albums he released during their separation, while Ono's records of the time appeared under her name alone. When they got back together in 1975, Ono became pregnant, and both decided to retire from music to be parents. Their son Sean Lennon was born on October 9, 1975, which was Lennon's 35th birthday.

In 1980, Lennon and Ono decided to restart their music careers, but this time their records appeared under their own names, and the Plastic Ono Band name was retired.

[[Standard]]

CATEGORIES: Measurement

A standard is a basis for comparison. Standards are made either by many people that agree on something, or if some organisation makes it so. There are many different standards in many fields of daily life. Standards are important so that correct comparisons can be produced.

[[Mean]]

CATEGORIES: Statistics

In mathematics and statistics, the mean is a kind of average. Besides the mean, there are other kinds of average, and there are also a few kinds of mean. 

The most common mean is the arithmetic mean, which is calculated by adding all of the values together, then dividing by the number of values.

For example, if 1, 2, 2, 100, 100 is a set of numbers or scores. If we add all the numbers, the answer is 205.  By dividing this number by the number of numbers (5), we find that the mean is 41. The difficulty with this particular set of numbers is that no one in this group scored anything like a 41, and it does not tell us much about what kind of scores these numbers represent.

Irwin Allen Ginsberg (June 3, 1926 – April 5, 1997) was an American poet and author. He was part of the Beat Generation movement of poets in the 1950s. He was a friend of writers Jack Kerouac and William S. Burroughs, and later made friends with musicians Bob Dylan, Donovan, John Lennon and Yoko Ono, and many other celebrities.

Ginsberg's most famous work was called Howl. It was a long poem about the social conditions of the United States in the 1950s. It began with the words "I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness." It went on to describe the frustration felt by many Americans, young people and minorities in particular. There were problems in the country, such as prejudice and intolerance, that needed to be spoken about. Ginsberg published the poem, and also performed it at public poetry readings.

A few people did not like Howl, or the graphic language Ginsberg used. They tried to have Howl banned, and they wanted Ginsberg to be prosecuted (given a court trial, then either fined or put in jail). Ginsberg went to trial, and the judge decided Howl was an important work, and told the truth about America at the time. The judge rejected the ban and cleared Ginsberg, who could then continue to publish and perform the poem.

Ginsberg became involved in social causes through his work, and through the famous people he met. He grew up in the Jewish faith, but later became a Buddhist. He was a homosexual, and his longtime partner was another poet, Peter Orlovsky. He also had a long relationship with Neal Cassady, who appeared as "N.C., secret hero of these poems" in Howl.

[[Furniture]]

CATEGORIES: Furniture

Furniture is the word that means all the things like chairs, tables, cupboards, beds and bookcases, etc. 

In other words, furniture are all the things that are in the house and that people can use to sit, to lie on or that are supposed to contain smaller things like cloths or cups. Furniture is made of wood, particle boards, leather, screws etc.

Different rooms have different furniture for different purposes. Offices have office furniture such as desks and office chairs. Dining rooms have a table and dining chairs. Theaters and classrooms have rows of seats facing forward.

Bedroom furniture includes a bed covered by sheets, a bedspread and maybe a blanket and pillow . Next to the bed is the nightstand or night table. A lamp may be on the nightstand. The dresser has drawers for clothes. On top of a dresser may be a mirror.

[[Rhythm]]

CATEGORIES: Basic English 850 words, Music theory

Rhythm refers to the length of time between each major "beat", or accent, such as in a piece of music. It is the sequence of sounds and silences which make up the rhythm. The first beat of a group of regular, evenly spaced beats usually feels stronger than the others.  When we write music down, we put each group in bars (or “measures”). 

Rhythms can have different patterns which can be clapped or tapped.  In Western music, these patterns are common:  

A conductor will beat time.  The rhythm will fit in to this regular beat.

All musicians have to have a good sense of rhythm.  To play or sing rhythmically they must keep a steady beat in their head (if playing alone), listen to the others players (if playing in groups) or watch the conductor (if there is one).

People who are playing on their own can practise with a metronome to help them to play to a steady beat.  However, musicians also use rubato (rhythmic freedom), especially when playing music of a romantic nature.  One has to learn to let the music “breathe” in the right way.  This is not the same as playing unrhythmically (badly).  It is something one learns with experience.

Feeling the rhythm in music is basically human.  A person who has a stroke may lose language, but not the sense of rhythm.  Neurologist Oliver Sacks says that chimpanzees and other animals do not have a sense of rhythm.

[[Necessary]]

CATEGORIES: Basic English 850 words

If something is necessary, it is very important, otherwise something will be impossible, or it will not work as it should do.  The opposite is unnecessary.

Something that is necessary is a necessity.

The "bare necessities of life" are things like food, clothes and shelter (things you need to keep alive).

[[Inheritance]]

CATEGORIES: Death customs, Property

Inheritance is the practice of passing on property, titles, debts, and duties when someone dies. Those things usually go to family members. People have had laws about inheritance for thousands of years. Often the question is settled in a will.

If only sons and other male family members get the inheritance, it is called patrilineal succession.  If only daughters and other female family members get the inheritance, it is called matrilineal succession.

Cultural inheritance is called legacy. Genetic inheritance is called heredity.

The person who gets the property and other things when someone dies is called the heir (male) or heiress (female).

[[Consonant]]

CATEGORIES: Letters (alphabet)

All the letters in the alphabet are either consonants or vowels. A consonant is a speech sound in which the air is at least partly blocked, and any letter which represents this. Consonants may come singily (by themselves) or in clusters (two or more together), but must be connected to a vowel to form a syllable.

Notice that the consonant (C) and vowel (V) notation does NOT match the letters of English spelling in a one-to-one relationship (e.g. 'th' is one sound), but rather individual sounds.

Words with single consonants include:

Words with consonant clusters include:

Consonants have friction when they are spoken, mostly using the position of the tongue against the lips, teeth and roof of the mouth. b and p are plosives, using the lips to produce a tiny sharp sound. Phonetics texts give more details, with diagrams. Consonants may be voiced or unvoiced. The th in the is voiced, but in breath is not.

[[Vowel]]

CATEGORIES: Letters (alphabet), Linguistics

A vowel is a particular kind of speech sound made by changing the shape of the upper vocal tract, or the area in the mouth above the tongue. In English it is important to know that there is a difference between a vowel sound and a letter in the alphabet. In English there are five vowel letters in the alphabet.

The sounds of American English are written with letters in the English alphabet, as either vowels or consonants. All English words are written with vowel letters in them.

These letters are vowels in English:

It is said that Y is "sometimes" a vowel, because the letter Y represents both vowel and consonant sounds. In the words cry, sky, fly, my and why, letter Y represents the vowel sound /aɪ/. In words like myth and synchronize, Y represents the vowel sound /ɪ/. In words like only, quickly, and folly, Y represents the vowel sound /i/.

It can also be a consonant sound called a glide as in the beginning of these words: yellow, yacht, yam, yesterday. Y is a consonant about 2.5% of the time, and a vowel about 97.5% of the time.

The letter W can sometimes be the second part of a vowel sound as in words like such as cow, bow, or how. In these words the vowel has the sound of /aʊ/. The letter W can be used as a consonant sound at the beginning of in the words when, where, wet. In some languages, like Welsh, the letter W represents the vowel sound /ʊ/, like cwm (a kind of valley).

In written English the six vowel letters are used to represent the 13-15 vowel sounds (depending on the variety) in English. This means there are many more vowel sounds than letters in the English alphabet, and the English spelling systems doesn't always help us figure out what the English sounds are. This can be confusing.

[[Metronome]]

CATEGORIES: Music

A metronome is a small device that can be used by people who are practising instruments to help them to play in time. It is also something a composer can use to show the performer what speed to play.

A traditional metronome works by clockwork. It has a pendulum which makes a loud tick as it goes to and fro, like the pendulum of a grandfather clock. It has to be wound up after a few minutes of ticking. There is a weight on the pendulum which can be slid up or down and set to a particular speed. There are numbers on the metronome to which you can set it. These numbers mean the number of ticks per minutes. A speed of 60 will make it tick 60 times a minute (i.e. every second). The numbers usually go from 40 (slow) to 208 (very fast). Nowadays many people use electronic metronomes. These are very accurate, do not need to be wound and often have other helpful things like an A to tune to (see musical tuning). Some of them are hardly bigger than a credit card.

The metronome was invented by Dietrich Nikolaus Winkel in Amsterdam in 1812. A man called Johann Maelzel copied Winkel’s ideas and improved them. He made a small, portable metronome which was patented in 1816. 

The metronome made it possible for a composer to show the performer what speed he wanted. If the composer writes at the top of his music: Crotchet (quarter note) = 76, for example, then the metronome can be set at 76 and it will tick at the right speed for that piece of music. Sometimes they write "MM76". The "MM" stands for "Maelzel's Metronome". Beethoven was the first composer to use metronome markings, but he often gave very fast speed indications, and some people wonder whether he made mistakes or whether his metronome worked properly.

[[Military–industrial complex]]

CATEGORIES: Military-industrial complex

The military–industrial complex refers to the relationship between the government, the military, and the businesses that make things for the military. For example, the businesses can give money to politicians in elections.  Then, politicians give more money to the military.  Then, the military buys things from the businesses.  Each group gains something, so they try to keep doing the same thing.

The term was invented in the United States.  However, most countries have politicians and soldiers and people who make weapons and other military supplies; thus they have a military-industrial complex.

When there is a military-industrial complex, problems can happen.  The government can become corrupt.  A business might want the country to be at war because they make more money during war than during times of peace.

[[Europa (moon)]]

CATEGORIES: Jupiter's moons

Europa is a large moon of the planet Jupiter. It is a little smaller than Earth's Moon and it is the sixth largest moon in the solar system.

Europa's diameter is about 3000 kilometers. It probably has an iron core, and an atmosphere that's mostly oxygen. The surface is icy and very smooth. There are not a lot of craters, but there are some cracks and lines. Because the surface is so young and smooth, scientists believe that there is a liquid ocean under the surface, a so-called subsurface (below the surface) ocean, and that it is kept warm by tidal heating. In other words, Jupiter's strong gravitational pull on Europa makes it warm.

The moon Europa was found by Simon Marius in December 1609. Galileo Galilei first saw the moon in January 1610 (he did not know Marius had found it). Simon Marius was the one who had the idea of the name 'Europa'.

The moon Europa is named after a princess from Greek mythology who became the first queen of Crete. However, people usually called Europa 'Jupiter II' until the middle of the 20th century.

[[Taxi]]

CATEGORIES: Automobiles, Public transport

A taxi (taxicab or cab in the United States) is a car, or other vehicle which is used for public transport. People use them to get to where they want to go. This means  there are no stops in between where they get on and where they get off. Many big cities have taxis.

In most other types of public transport, such as a bus, tram, or train, the rider does not get to choose the locations where they want to get picked up or dropped off. These vehicles often take certain roads or follow a very specific route.  Because of this, they usually do not stop exactly where people want to go.

Riding a taxi is a lot like having your own car, but you don't drive it. You only tell the taxi driver where you want to go and he or she will take you there. How much you pay for the ride, in most cases, depends on how far you are going from where you get on. It is common for the price for a taxi ride to be more expensive than other forms of transport.

[[Certificate of deposit]]

CATEGORIES: Money

A certificate of deposit (CD) is a way to store money at a bank or credit union. A CD is written for a period of time: usually between three months and five years. The person who wanted the CD—the consumer—agrees to give the money to the bank for that period of time and may not take the money back until the time has expired. If the consumer takes the money back before the agreed amount of time, they will have to pay a penalty fee. Once your contract is over, you are given your money back plus the interest it earned. People open CDs instead of savings accounts because the interest is higher. A certificate of deposit (which is common only in the United States) is similar to a time deposit.

[[Robert Walpole]]

CATEGORIES: 1676 births, 1745 deaths, People from Norfolk, Whig party (UK) politicians, Prime Ministers of Great Britain

Sir Robert Walpole, 1st Earl of Orford was a British politician. He is regarded by many as the first  de facto Prime Minister of the United Kingdom (then called Great Britain). The position of prime minister was not actually official at that time.

Walpole He was born in Houghton, Norfolk on 26 August 1676. He died on 18 March 1745. Historians think he became England's first Prime Minister in 1721. He was then Prime Minister for a longer time than anyone who came after him. This long time is sometimes called "the robinocracy" (Robin is a common version of Robert).

Although the exact dates of Walpole's dominance are not entirely clear, the period 1721–1742 is often used. He dominated the Walpole–Townshend ministry, as well as the subsequent Walpole ministry, and holds the record as the longest-serving British prime minister in history. 

W.A. Speck wrote that Walpole's uninterrupted run of 20 years as Prime Minister "is rightly regarded as one of the major feats of British political history... Explanations are usually offered in terms of his expert handling of the political system after 1720, and his unique blending of the surviving powers of the crown with the increasing influence of the Commons".

[[Tolkāppiyam]]

CATEGORIES: Tamil language

Tolkaapiyam (தொல்காப்பியம்) is a book on grammar of the Tamil language.

Tol (தொல்) means Old and Kappiyam (காப்பியம்) means a literary work.

The name of the author could not be identified (usually referred as Tholkappiyar) and the work apparently relates to Grammar in Tamil.

It is learnt that the author was one of the 12 disciples of Sage Agastya the Father of Tamil Grammar. This sage was living in the south near Madurai, during the visit of Lord Ram to the south in search of his wife, abducted by the Lankan King Ravan.

The age of Lord Ram precedes that of Lord Krishna and hence the work can safely be said to precede 3000 BC (the ideal period of Mahabharat Yudh).

Lord Shiva and his Son Murugan is said to have laid the first tenets for the Tamil Language, probably long long time before sage Agastya could compile the same.

[[Great auk]]

CATEGORIES: Charadriiformes, Flightless birds, Extinct species

The great auk was a large bird, that could not fly. People hunted it for meat and feathers. It grew rare, because it was too easy to kill, and the ones left could not breed fast enough to make up for the lost ones. The last known great auks (there were two auks) were killed on June 3, 1844 in Iceland.  It lived mostly in the water, like a duck. 

Penguins got their name from the great auk. The word "penguin" was the Celtic word for "great auk". When sailors saw penguins for the first time, they thought they looked like great auks. 

The great auk was covered in black feathers, but had white feathers on its chest and abdomen. It had very short wings, like stubs, which meant it could not fly. On land it stood upright and was about 75 cm tall. They spent most of their time at sea, coming to shore in the summer to breed. They lived in large breeding colonies on low rocky islands in the north Atlantic Ocean from Canada to Norway. Females laid one egg on bare rock. In winter they went as far south as Florida and southern Spain.

[[Psychoanalysis]]

CATEGORIES: Psychology, Philosophical movements and positions

Psychoanalysis is a field of psychology and medical therapy. It is a set of theories and ways of treating mental disorders. It was started in the early 1890s by the Austrian psychologist Sigmund Freud, with experience from the clinical work of Josef Breuer and others.

Since then, psychoanalysis has expanded and been revised, reformed and developed in different ways. Freud's own colleagues and students, such as Alfred Adler and Carl Jung, had their own ideas. They went on to develop their ideas independently from Freud. Much later, Anna Freud and Melanie Klein used the ideas to treat troubled children.

The basic ideas of psychoanalysis are:

Windows 3.x was made better in 1992, with Windows for Workgroups 3.1x (1992-1993), that added networking support.

[[Woodwind instrument]]

CATEGORIES: Woodwind instruments

A woodwind instrument is an instrument belonging to the woodwind family.  Traditionally they were always made of wood, although some of them are now made of metal or plastic.

In an orchestra there are four main types of woodwind instrument.  Each of these also has related instruments of different sizes:

The piccolo is the highest of the four main instruments.  The lowest note is Middle C and it has a range of 3 octaves.  The piccolo is the smallest and highest instrument in the orchestra.  It plays one octave higher than the flute.  There is also an alto flute which sounds a fifth lower than the ordinary flute.  Flutes are still sometimes made of wood, but mostly they are metal.

The oboe can play slightly lower than the flute.  There is a larger version called the cor anglais (which means: “English horn”). This is a double reeded instrument. The clarinet plays nearly an octave lower than the flute.  The bass clarinet plays an octave lower than the clarinet. The bassoon is the lowest of the four.

The recorder is one of the oldest and most popular woodwinds and has been used to great effect by greats, such as Bach, Telemann and Vivaldi.  The general public is normally only familiar with the plastic, child's version of the recorder, but professional and high-quality recorders are still made of wood.

The saxophone may look like a brass instrument, but it is played like a clarinet and therefore it is a woodwind instrument.  It is usually played in bands and jazz groups.

Dumbo was made to make up for the damages of Pinocchio and Fantasia. The movie has been criticized in recent years as being "racist" (the leader crow in the movie was named "Jim Crow" and at some point in the 1950s was renamed "Dandy Crow" in attempt to avoid controversy, but the original name is still the one mostly known, although it was supposed to be just a sarcastic mockery to the Jim Crow laws in the Southern USA back then and was used only on the character's model sheets), yet is also considered to be one of Disney's best movies.

[[Bassoon]]

CATEGORIES: Double reed instruments

The bassoon is the lowest of the four main instrument of the woodwind family. Like the oboe, it has a double reed. The reed is attached to a curved metal mouthpiece called a "crook" or "bocal" which is joined to the main part of the instrument. This consists of two parts called ‘bass joint’ and ‘wing joint’ (or ‘tenor joint’). These two are joined at the bottom by a U-shaped piece called the ‘boot’. At the top of the instrument is the ‘bell joint’. The instrument is quite heavy. Some players have a neckstrap around their neck to support the weight, but usually they use a seat strap that connects at the bottom of the boot and goes across the floor. The bassoonist, a person who plays a bassoon, then sits on that strap. The bassoon is held to the right side of the bassoonist and the top of the boot joint is usually level with the players hip. The bassoon, when played right, can sound very beautiful. The bassoon has one of the largest note ranges, going from low B flat to a high F on the top line of the treble clef. The bassoon can also play in tenor clef, but usually plays bass clef.

Some bassoons have a white, ivory ring round the top of the bell joint. These are German bassoons (called ‘Heckel’). French bassoons (called ‘Buffet’) do not have this ring, and also sound quite different to German bassoons. Bassoons have keys to help the player to cover all the holes, but these keys do not use the Boehm fingering system like the other woodwind instruments. German bassoons use a system called the Heckel system, and French bassoons use the Buffet system..

The Bassoon is usually seen as a comical instrument, however it provides a very important role in the orchestra.In fact, the Saxophone was invented to replace the Bassoon and Oboe, however, was rejected because it didn't sound the same in the orchestra.

[[Octave]]

CATEGORIES: Music theory

An octave is the distance between two musical notes that have the same letter name.

If a musician sings or plays a scale (‘do-re-mi-fa-sol-la-si-do’) the first and last ‘do’ are an octave apart. It is called an ‘octave’ because there are eight notes in a scale (‘octo’ is Latin for ‘eight’).

If a musician sings or plays the first two notes of the song “Somewhere over the rainbow” (i.e. the word ‘Somewhere’) these two notes are an octave apart.

Two notes that are an octave apart sound very similar, almost like the same note. The scientific reason for this is that the top note vibrates twice as fast.  For example: if someone plays Middle C on a piano, a hammer hits the Middle C strings inside and makes them vibrate 256 times a second.  The C an octave higher will vibrate 512 times a second. 

Young children who learn the piano will not be able to stretch an octave with one hand, if their hands are too small. Most adults can stretch an octave easily (playing one note with the thumb, and the other with the little finger). Advanced pianists can practice.

It was thereafter announced Harper would resign as party leader and had requested an interim leader be chosen to serve until a leadership election can be held.

[[Tadpole]]

CATEGORIES: Frogs

A tadpole or polliwog is a young frog that breathes and lives in the water. They hatch from small eggs laid in a pond or lake by their mother.

Frog eggs are round and toad eggs are laid in long strings. There is enough food in each egg to last 21 days.

After a few weeks, they begin to grow back legs, then front legs. Soon after, the froglets begin to breathe air and lose their tails. They will grow larger, and in a few months, become adults.

Most types of tadpole eat only plants. Some types of tadpole eat plants and animals, even other smaller tadpoles.

During the tadpole stage of the amphibian life cycle, most breathe by means of external or internal gills. They usually do not have arms or legs until the change to adulthood. They have a large, flattened tail with which they swim by 'lateral undulation' (side to side), similar to most fish.

As a tadpole matures, it changes by gradually growing limbs, usually the back legs first. Then it gradually loses its tail by programmed cell death (apoptosis).  Lungs develop at the time of leg development: tadpoles late in development are often near the surface of the water, where they breathe air. During the final stages, the tadpole's mouth changes from a small mouth at the front of the head to a large mouth the same width as the head. The intestines shorten to accommodate the new diet. Most tadpoles are herbivorous, living on algae and plants. Some species are omnivorous, eating detritus and, when available, smaller tadpoles.

[[Digital rights management]]

CATEGORIES: Technology, Copyright

Digital rights management (DRM) is a way to make it difficult to copy music, movies, and computer programs. It is used to make people follow copyright laws. It works by using computer technologies.

Many companies use DRM to protect their properties from copyright infringement, such as Sony, Microsoft and the BBC. Other companies also use DRM.

Some people do not like digital rights management. They think that DRM makes copying harder than copyright laws allow. The Free Software Foundation suggested that 'digital restrictions management' is a better name.

People can break DRM. If someone breaks a DRM technology then copying is possible. All common DRM technologies have been broken. Making a DRM technology that can not be broken is very hard. Some people say that all DRM technologies can be broken. In the United States it is illegal to break a DRMThis is debatable at best.

[[Brown algae]]

CATEGORIES: Algae

Brown algae are a large group of multicellular algae.   All the brown algae are multicellular.  Most brown algae have fucoxanthin, a chemical that gives them a brown color. They inlude many seaweeds in colder waters of the Northern Hemisphere. Most brown algae live in marine environments, where they play an important role both as food and as a potential habitat. 

There are 2000 species of brown algae.  Most species live in the ocean. They are important as food and as homes for many animals and marine life.  Some brown algae are gathered by humans for food.  The giant kelp Macrocystis is a brown alga that forms underwater forests, and it may grow to 60 meters.  The Sargasso Sea gets its name from the Sargassum seaweed that floats on the surface. Many brown algae grow on rocks at the seashore.

Brown algae are unique among heterokonts in developing into multicellular forms with differentiated tissues. But they reproduce by means of flagellated spores and gametes that look like the cells of other heterokonts. Genetic studies show their closest relatives to be the yellow-green algae (Xanthophyceae).

The crown-of-thorns is also one of the largest starfish in the world, as it has a diameter of up to 3 feet. The crown-of-thorns lives in the warmer areas of the Pacific Ocean, Indian Ocean, and Red Sea.

It only feeds on coral polyps, and usually at night. The crown-of-thorns climbs over its prey, releases digestive enzymes to break down its food, and then absorbs the coral polyp, which has now turned into a liquid. What's left behind by the sea star is the leftover coral skeleton.

They are usually of subdued colours, pale brown to grey-green, but they may be garish with bright warning colours in some parts of their wide range. These bright colours warn animals that may want to eat it that it is venomous.

Sea urchins mostly feed on algae and small animals. They have a special chewing apparatus called Aristotle's lantern, after the Greek philosopher Aristotle who was fascinated by sea urchins. With this apparatus they can scrape organisms stuck to the surface over which the urchin is moving.

[[Brittle star]]

CATEGORIES: Echinoderms

Brittle stars are Echinoderms of the Class Ophiuroidea. The adults are superficially like starfish, but they are a different group, with different larvae. Like other echinoderms, they do have a skeleton of calcareous plates, and radial symmetry. There are about 1500 different species. 

Usually they have 5 arms, which can grow long, up to 60 cm, in the largest species. The central disk of brittle stars can be three to eight inches in diameter. Unlike starfish, they live deeper in the ocean. Ophiuroids are known even from abyssal (>6000 m) depths.  However, brittle stars are also common members of reef communities, where they hide under rocks and even within other living organisms. Generally, brittle stars live below 500m of depth. 

There are two related groups of Ophiuroids: the Ophiurida (brittle stars) and the basket stars (Eurialida). Basket stars usually live in the deeper parts of the range. Brittle stars are mostly scavengers and detrivores, able to catch some small prey on occasion.

[[Bivalve]]

CATEGORIES: Bivalves

The bivalves are a large class of molluscs, also known as pelecypods.

They have a hard calcareous shell made of two parts or 'valves'. The soft parts are inside the shell. The shell is usually bilaterally symmetrical.

There are over 30,000 species of bivalves, including the fossil species. There are about 9,200 living species in 1,260 genera and 106 families. All of them live in the water, most of them in the sea or in brackish water. Some live in fresh water. All are filter feeders: they lost their radula in the course of evolution. A few are carnivorous, eating much larger prey than the tiny microalgae eaten by other bivalves.

The best known examples of bivalves are clams, mussels, scallops and oysters.

[[Bishop]]

CATEGORIES: Christian religious occupations

Bishop is a type of clergy in some Christian churches. The bishop is the leader of the Christians and the Christian priests in each diocese. The diocese which a bishop governs is called a bishopric. Episcopal is the adjective for bishops. A cathedral is the church building where the bishop has an episcopal throne. The cathedral is the main church of the diocese and the bishop's see. A bishop may be given the rank of archbishop in an archdiocese. 

Christian priests in some denominations must be made priests by bishops. In these denominations, bishops are above parish priests in the hierarchy of the church's organization. However, some Protestant denominations have no bishops or archbishops. The Presbyterianism is an example. The leader of the Church of Scotland is the Moderator. The General Assembly elects the Moderator of the Church of Scotland each year. Other Christian movements have neither bishops nor priests: Quakers are one example.

In the Catholic church, the Pope is chosen by all the cardinals from amongst their number. According to church law, this does not have to be the case: any male, unmarried, baptized Christian who is judged fit for the office can become pope. However, the last pope who was not a bishop was Urban VI (elected in 1378).

The pope is also 'the Bishop of Rome'.  In fact he rules an independent state within Rome, called the Vatican.  All Roman Catholic bishops answer to the pope (or to patriarchs in some orthodox churches).  In the Anglican church, bishops are governed by Archbishops.

Usually a bishop can be identified by a special hat, called a mitre.

[[Tray]]

CATEGORIES: Basic English 850 words

A tray is a shallow container designed for carrying things.

Trays are flat, but with raised edges to stop things from sliding off of them. They are often rectangular, and may or may not have handles with which to carry them.

His brother Charles Wesley was a famous writer of Church music.

[[Salivary gland]]

CATEGORIES: Mouth, Exocrine system, Glands

The salivary glands make saliva. Saliva keeps the mouth and other parts of the digestive system wet and slippery. It also helps break down food when you are chewing. This helps food go down the throat to the stomach.

There are three main pairs of salivary glands. They are

There are also many small glands in the tongue, cheeks, lips and palate. All of those glands make mucous.

[[Vas deferens]]

CATEGORIES: Anatomy of the male reproductive system

The vas deferens (or ductus deferens)   is a duct in a man’s body.  It is also present in other male vertebrates. Its function is to carry sperm away from the testes, towards the penis.

There are two of these ducts, which are tubes surrounded by smooth muscle.  They connect the left and right epididymis to the ejaculatory ducts in order to move sperm. Each tube is about 30 centimeters long. During ejaculation the smooth muscle in the wall of the vas deferens contracts. That pushes the sperm toward the penis. The sperm go from the vas deferens into the urethra. Other male sex glands push out at the same time.

[[Whisker]]

CATEGORIES: Facial hair, Animal anatomy

A whisker is a long, thick hair around the mouth of some animals, mostly mammals such as cats and mice, that the animal uses to feel its surroundings. Some animals, such as cats, also have whiskers above their eyes and on the backs of their legs. Unlike other hair, whiskers should never be cut or trimmed, as this can confuse the animal.

Whiskers can also mean a beard or mustache.

[[Magma]]

CATEGORIES: Volcanology

Magma is the melted rock under the ground. 

There are different types of magma. One is called felsic magma. Felsic magma is thick and has silica minerals. It mostly makes light-coloured rocks. Another type is called mafic magma, which is runny and has less silica. It usually makes dark-coloured rocks. Magmas can be intermediate between both types. 

Magma may become solid  by cooling slowly below the surface. This makes "plutonic" rocks such as granite. When magma comes out from the ground in a volcano it is called lava. Lava cools quickly, and forms other kinds of rock such as basalt. 

Magma is produced by melting of the Earth's mantle or the crust. It happens at tectonic settings, such as subduction zones, continental rift zones, mid-ocean ridges and hotspots. 

Melted material from the mantle and crust moves up through the crust and collects  in magma chambers. 

When they come up through the crust, magmas may feed a volcano and come out  as lava. But they may solidify underground to form an intrusion. Intrusions eventually cool down and become igneous dikes or  sills. 

The study of magma is usually done in lava flows. However, magma was found under the ground three times in geothermal drilling projects—twice in Iceland and once in Hawaii.

[[Yenisei]]

CATEGORIES: Rivers of Russia, Mongolia, Siberia

The Yenisei (Енисе́й) is a river in Siberia. It belongs to the greatest river system that flows into the Arctic Ocean. The Yenisei is the fifth-longest river in the world. It is a little shorter than the Mississippi River, but with 1.5 times the flow. It comes from Mongolia and follows a northern course to the Kara Sea. The river drains a large part of central Siberia. The longest stream following the Yenisei-Angara-Selenga-Ider is about 5539 km long. Its watershed, which includes the world's largest (by volume) lake, Lake Baikal, holds more water than any other river system.

The upper parts of the system have rapids and flooding, and pass through areas where very few people live. The middle section is controlled by a series of large hydroelectric dams. The dams were built to supply a major Russian primary industry. Partly built by gulag labor in Soviet times, industrial contamination is a big problem in the area. The area is very hard for the police to watch. Moving on through sparsely populated taiga, the Yenisei grows with many tributaries and finally reaches the Kara Sea in desolate tundra where it is covered with ice for more than half the year. As with other Siberian rivers, the flow has increased lately. People think this is because of global warming. A concern was also raised that a change in the salt in the Arctic may have a global impact on ocean currents.

Bartolomeu Dias(or Bartholomew Dias, 1450 - May 29, 1500) was a Portuguese explorer who was the first European to sail past the Cape of Good Hope now Cape Town. 

In 1487, King John II of Portugal asked  Dias to find a new route for the spice trade and to find a legendary Christian king named Prester John in the east. In 1488 Bartholomew and his sailors sailed along the western coast of Africa. They got caught in a storm and landed at a cape in southern Africa and they could not sail beyond that point. They named it "Cape of Storms" and later returned to Portugal. The king of Portugal considered it as a victory gained by the Portuguese adventurers and named it as "Cape of Good Hope". Because Prester John did not really exist, they did not find his country but the route from the Atlantic Ocean to the Indian Ocean leading to Asia turned out to be valuable. 

Commanding a ship in Pedro Álvares Cabral's later expedition to Brazil he died at sea in 1500 during a storm. There was a statue made for him later in Cape Town, South Africa.

[[CD-R]]

CATEGORIES: Compact Disc

A CD-R (also called Compact Disc Recordable) is a compact disc that can be recorded once. When people record a compact disc, they put either music or data on it.

A compact disc that can be recorded multiple times (and erased) is the CD-RW.

When you put data onto a CD, it is called burning a disc. A laser "burns" pits into a dye layer on the disc, making them transparent. These transparent pits can later be read back by the CD drive or audio CD player as data or music.

There are three types of dye used in CD-R discs. The most common is phthalocyanine, and it is usually light green. CMC Pro (formerly Taiyo Yuden) uses cyanine dye. It is usually teal or dark green. Verbatim uses phthalocyanine dye on some discs, and AZO dye on others. AZO dye is usually dark blue or blue-ish silver. The metal layer on the disc is usually made of silver. Archival discs and some professional audio discs use a gold top layer. Verbatim UltraLife discs have a silver main layer, and a gold upper protective layer, providing the reflectivity of silver and the chemical stability of gold. Early cyanine discs could decay and become unplayable within a few years. Recent cyanine discs have preservatives added to the dye to prevent this from happening. AZO and phthalocyanine dyes do not need preservatives and do not decay easily.

[[Krill]]

CATEGORIES: Krill

Krill are small shrimp-like crustaceans  about an inch or so long, found in all the oceans of the world. In areas with nutrients, they occur in huge swarms, with more than 10,000 krill per cubic meter. They feed on phytoplankton and to a lesser extent zooplankton. 

Krill are ecologically very important, because they are near the bottom of the food chain. They make up the largest part of the diet of  many animals. In the Southern Ocean, one species, the Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, makes up an estimated biomass of over 500000000, roughly twice that of the human race. They are eaten by many animals, including whales, seals, penguins, birds, fish, squid, and whale sharks. Of this, over half is eaten by each year, and is replaced by growth and reproduction. 

Most krill species make large vertical migrations. They are distinguished from other crustaceans such as true shrimp by their externally visible gills.

[[Carpet]]

CATEGORIES: Cloth

A carpet is a rectangular piece of woven textile.

Generally, carpets are used to make spaces more beautiful and to make walking on the floor quieter. Carpets are warmer and softer than hard floors such as hardwood, tile, or concrete. Carpets may be many different sizes. Rugs and carpets originated in Central Asia, but the idea of machine manufacture was invented in Europe. The oldest known carpet was found in the year of 1947 at excavations in Siberia. So there are two different kinds of things: one is hand-made by traditional methods, and the other woven by machine. This accounts for the very great difference in style and price between traditional rugs and modern wall-to-wall carpeting.

The name "carpet" comes from Old Italian carpita, "carpire" means to pluck. The term "carpet" is used mostly to describe textiles placed on the floor most of the times stretched from wall to wall.

Rugs are smaller in size, often placed over a carpet, and often decorated. In Islam, rugs are used as prayer mats, for people to kneel on when they pray.

It is common, especially in the Middle East, for rugs and carpets to be used as wall decoration, and they are designed with decoration in mind. Mass-manufactured carpets in western countries are utilitarian: for hard use on the floor, and usually self-coloured (that is one color over the whole carpet). Traditional rugs from the Middle East are hand-made and may be very expensive by the time they reach shops in the western world.

In some countries carpets are designed in a way to tell stories. They can tell history of family or something important that happened.

[[Digon]]

CATEGORIES: Shapes, Polygons

In geometry, a digon  is a polygon with two sides (edges) and two vertices. Its construction is degenerate in a Euclidean plane because either the two sides would coincide or one or both would have to be curved; however, it can be easily visualised in elliptic space.

A regular digon has both angles equal and both sides equal and is represented by Schläfli symbol . It may be constructed on a sphere as a pair of 180 degree arcs connecting antipodal points, when it forms a lune.

The digon is the simplest abstract polytope of rank 2.

A truncated digon, t is a square, . An alternated digon, h is a monogon, .

[[Great circle]]

CATEGORIES: Shapes

A great circle the largest possible circle that can be drawn on a sphere, one that divides the surface into equal halves, called hemispheres. It is a circle that has the same diameter as the sphere it was drawn on. These curves are geodesics in the sphere and all have the same circumference, that is, the length of the circle.

There are an infinite number of great circles that can be drawn on any perfect sphere.  The longitude lines on a globe all form great circles that pass through the same two points (the North Pole and the South Pole). The Equator is another great circle.

Great Circles can be used to determine the shortest surface distance between two points on a sphere (or on the earth).

A straight line from plane Euclidean geometry corresponds to a Great Circle in non-Euclidean spherical geometry.

[[Medicine man]]

CATEGORIES: Native American, Religious people, Health care

A medicine man is a traditional Native American healer. Healing was only part of their function. Another part of their role was as guardian of their belief system, and their rituals. 

A very similar role was played in many other mesolithic and neolithic societies, such as pre-modern Africa and New Guinea. This person, man or woman, might help cure physical, mental, or spiritual health problems. A term such as shaman or witch doctor reflects the supernatural element in such roles.

[[Basement]]

CATEGORIES: Construction

The basement is the lowest room in some buildings, almost always below the ground. There is another type of basement, called a subcellar. A subcellar is just like a basement, but more below it.

Most basements have lights.

[[Landfill]]

CATEGORIES: Waste

A landfill is a place where waste is kept. Waste is usually buried in landfills, but it may first be sorted to remove any recyclable materials.

Landfills have a bad smell and look bad, therefore are usually located far away from where people live. 

Once the waste is crushed into very small pieces, it is buried, but without oxygen, a dangerous gas called methane is created. This process is called anaerobic digestion. In some countries, the methane from landfills is used to generate energy.

[[Human reproductive system]]

CATEGORIES: Reproductive system

A reproductive system is the part of an organism that makes them able to sexually reproduce. Humans and other animals use their reproductive systems to have sexual intercourse as well as reproduce. The reproductive system is one of the human organ systems. 

The illustrations here show only human reproductive systems. Other mammals have similar reproductive systems.

[[Rectum]]

CATEGORIES: Anatomy of the digestive system

The rectum is a part of the large intestine which forms a part of the gastrointestinal system. The rectum ends in the anus which is the end of the gastrointestinal system. It is where feces or stools are stored temporarily before coming out of the anus.

Body temperature can also be taken in the rectum. Rectal temperature can be taken by inserting a medical thermometer not more than 25 mm (1 inch) into the rectum via the anus. Normal rectal temperature generally ranges from 36 to 38 °C (97.6 to 100.4 °F) and is about 0.5 °C (1 °F) above oral (mouth) temperature and about 1 °C (2 °F) above axilla (armpit) temperature and 3 degrees warmer than vaginal temperatures. 

The rectum was featured in film series, 'The Human Centipede,' a horror movie about the face of loss in a world of deep connection and interesting cuisine. Within the film it is stated that, "Humans have a profound desire for other rectums." Often this is due to the G-stop for men being located between the Anus and the testicles, giving men a desire to be anally penetrated in the rectum, this form of rectal pleasure first ever documented in the journal of Henry IV. 

[[County seat]]

CATEGORIES: Local government, County seats in the United States

A county seat is the location of a county government, and is usually the largest, oldest, or most central town or city within a county. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, the name county town is used rather than county seat.

[[Pacific Islands]]

CATEGORIES: Pacific islands

Pacific Islands are islands that are in the Pacific Ocean. There are about 20,000 or 30,000 of them. These islands are sometimes called Oceania. The Pacific Islands are in three groups. These groups are Polynesia, Melanesia, and Micronesia. People who live on these islands are called Pacific Islanders. These islands can be made by volcanoes or made on coral reefs. The islands made by volcanoes are bigger, and more people can live on them. The islands made on coral reefs are smaller, and fewer people can live on them. One of Oceania's biggest economic advantages are tourism. As many vacationers come to see the wildlife and the beautiful beaches that span the islands. Major countries and territories include Samoa, Hawaii (U.S), Federal States of Micronesia and French Polynesia. 

Island countries in the Pacific Ocean, such as Malaysia, Philippines, East Timor, Japan, Taiwan and most of Indonesia are not considered Pacific Islands since they do not lie in any of the three Oceanic regions. People inhabiting those islands, therefore are not Pacific Islanders. 

[[Large intestine]]

CATEGORIES: Anatomy of the digestive system

The large intestine is also called the colon or large bowel. It connects the small intestine to the rectum and anus. It is about 1.5 meters long or 5 feet. It is shorter than the small intestine, but its diameter is larger.

Water is absorbed here and the remaining waste material is stored as faeces before being removed by defecation.

[[Urine]]

CATEGORIES: Urinary system

Urine is a liquid created by the body in the kidneys. It is stored in the bladder and comes out of the human body through the urethra, a tube which leads from the bladder to the urethral meatus (meatus is an opening in the body), at the tip of the penis (men) or the vulva (women). Urinating is how the body gets rid of unwanted or unneeded substances in the blood. Urine is the liquid that these substances are put in. After the blood has circulated through the body, its composition has changed, because some substances in the blood have been absorbed by the body, and because the body has released other substances into the blood. The blood has also absorbed substances produced from our food. The liver removes many toxins (harmful substances) and adds other substances that the blood needs (amino acids, proteins, coagulation factors, hormones, etc.). Then the kidneys remove excess amounts of urea, salts, etc. by putting them into the urine. After the blood has passed through the liver and the kidneys, it has the correct composition that the body needs.

Urine is mostly water, and contains mineral salts, and about 2% urea, which is produced in the liver to remove ammonia, which is a very toxic substance. Urea has a very low toxicity, although a continuous high level of urea in the blood (a condition called hyperuremia) can cause disease.

The color of urine normally ranges from colourless to yellow. The yellow color is caused by urobilins, which are produced by the breakdown of hemoglobin, the substance that gives blood its red color. If a person is dehydrated, less urine will be produced (maybe less than one liter per day), and it will be more concentrated. If a person drinks a lot of water, more urine will be produced (maybe as much as two liters per day) and it will be less concentrated.

Urine lets the body get rid of:

Some slang terms for urine are "pee" and "piss".

[[Auschwitz concentration camp]]

CATEGORIES: 1940 establishments in Europe, Nazi concentration camps in Poland, World Heritage Sites in Poland, 20th century establishments in Poland

Auschwitz was a group of concentration camps run by Nazi Germany during World War II. There were three large camps at Auschwitz, and 3 smaller ones. Auschwitz I was the main camp, which held prisoners from 1940-1945. Auschwitz II (Birkenau) was the largest extermination camp (death camp) run by Nazi Germany during The Holocaust. Auschwitz III (Monowitz) and the subcamps were forced labor camps where prisoners worked as slaves. These camps were established because there were too many Polish prisoners and not enough room in "local" prisons to hold them in.

The Auschwitz camps were in a town in Poland called Oświęcim. ("Auschwitz" is the German name for "Oświęcim.") In German, Auschwitz was called Konzentrationslager Auschwitz (KZ Auschwitz), which means "Auschwitz concentration camp."

The Schutzstaffel (SS), led by Heinrich Himmler, ran the death camps and concentration camps in Nazi Germany.

No one knows exactly how many people were sent to Auschwitz, or how many died there. However, historians estimate that between 1940 and 1945, the Nazis sent at least 1.3 million people to Auschwitz. About 1.1 million of these people died or were killed at Auschwitz.

[[Common wombat]]

CATEGORIES: Marsupials of Australia

The common wombat, Vombatus ursinus, is one of three wombat species living in Australia. It is found the mountains and hills of southeast Australia, Tasmania, and Flinders Island in Bass Strait. They look like a small bear, which is what the name ursinus means. It is a marsupial, a type of mammal that carried its young in a pouch. It is the largest burrowing plant-eating mammal in the world. Its closest living relative is the koala.

[[Chimpanzee]]

CATEGORIES: Hominins

The common chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), or robust chimpanzee, is a species of great ape. The common chimpanzee is often called the chimpanzee (or "chimp"), though this can be used to refer to both species in the genus Pan: the common chimpanzee and the closely related bonobo. Evidence from fossils and DNA sequencing show both species of chimpanzees are the closest living relatives to modern humans.

The common chimpanzee is more robust than the bonobo, weighing between 40 and measuring approximately 1.3 from head to tail. Its gestation period is eight months. The infant is weaned at about three years old, but usually maintains a close relationship with its mother for several more years; it reaches puberty at the age of eight to 10, and its lifespan in captivity is about 50 years.

The common chimpanzee lives in groups which range from 15 to 150 members, although individuals travel and forage in much smaller groups during the day. The species lives in a male-dominated, strict hierarchy, so disputes can generally be settled without the need for violence. Nearly all chimpanzee populations have been recorded using tools, modifying sticks, rocks, grass, and leaves and use them for acquiring honey, termites, ants, nuts, and water. The species has also been found creating sharpened sticks to spear Senegal bushbabies out of small holes in trees.

The common chimpanzee is listed on the IUCN Red List as an endangered species. Between 170,000 and 300,000 individuals are estimated across its range in the forests and savannahs of West and Central Africa. The biggest threats to the common chimpanzee are habitat destruction, poaching and disease.

[[Bonobo]]

CATEGORIES: Hominins

The bonobo (Pan paniscus) is a great ape and the smaller of the two species making up the genus Pan (the other is Pan troglodytes, the common chimpanzee). The bonobo is sometimes called the dwarf or pygmy chimpanzee. Although the name "chimpanzee" is sometimes used to refer to both species together, it is usually understood to mean the common chimpanzee, while Pan paniscus is usually referred to as the bonobo.

The bonobo lives in rain forest, in a 500000 area south of the Congo River. This is in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Central Africa.

The bonobo has high levels of sexual behavior. Sex functions in conflict appeasement, affection, social status, excitement, and stress reduction. It occurs in virtually all partner combinations and in a variety of positions. This may explain the lower levels of aggression in the bonobo as compared to the common chimpanzee and other apes. Bonobos are matriarchal and a male's rank in the social hierarchy is often determined by his mother's rank.

The two chimpanzee species are separated by the huge Congo River. Its formation 1.5–2 million years ago may have led to the speciation of the bonobo. Their population is between 29,000 and 50,000 individuals. The species is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List. It is threatened by habitat destruction, human population growth and commercial poaching. The bonobo lives for about 40 years in captivity, though its lifespan in the wild is unknown.

[[Kalahasti]]

CATEGORIES: Hindu mythology

Kalahasti is a place in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. It is a place of pilgrimage for Hindus. In Kalhasti, there is a famous and ancient temple of Shiva, a god of Hindus. The temple is one of the five such temples of Shiva in south India collectively known as Pancha Bootha Sthalams. The other four such temples are at Kanchipuram, Thiruvanaikaval, Tiruvannamalai, and Chidambaram.

In this temple, people worship Shiva in the form of a linga. There are many mythological stories about this linga. One of the stories tell that an elephant, a snake, and a spider used to worship this linga. The god Shiva blessed them with moksha (liberation).

Another story tells about a saint named Kannappa. He took out his eyes and offered the same to the linga. At this supreme sacrifice, Shiva became very happy. He appeared in the form of a human being, and restored the eyesight of Kannappa. Kannappa is worshipped as one of the 63 saiva saints in Tamil Nadu.

Sri Kalahasti temple, 36 km away is famous for its Vayudeva temple, which is the only shrine of the god of wind in India. Constructed in the 12th century by the Chola king, Rajarajendra, Vayu is incarnated as Lord Shiva and worshipped as Kalahasteeswara.

This is an important temple dedicated to Lord Shiva. This temple has one of the elemental lingas, the vayu (air) linga. There is a lamp inside the inner sanctum that is constantly flickering despite the lack of air movement inside. The air-linga can be observed to move even when the pujaris close off the entrance to the main Deity room, which does not have any windows. You can see the flames on several ghee lamps flicker as if blown by moving air. The linga is white and is considered Swayambhu, or self-manifested.

Kalahasti is surrounded by two sacred hills. The Durgamba temple is on the northern hill. On the south hill there is the shrine of Kannabeswara, in memory of the Sage Kannappa, who offered an eye to the Lord. When he tried to offer his other eye as well, the Lord mercifully stopped him. There is also a temple dedicated to Subramanya on one of the surrounding hills.

The main linga is untouched by human hands, even by the priest. Abhisheka (bathing) is done by pouring a mixture of water, milk, camphor, and panchamrita. Sandal paste, flowers and the sacred thread are offered to the utsava-murti, not the main linga. 

This temple is one of the most impressive Siva temples in India. It features an enormous, ancient gopuram (tower) over the main gate. The tower is 36.5m (120 feet) high. The entire temple is carved out of the side of a huge stone hill. It was built in1516 by King Krishnadeva Raya.

The temple is run by neatly dressed Saivite Brahmins.

[[Rishi]]

CATEGORIES: Hindu mythology

Rishi is a word used in many Hindu scriptures. A simple translation of the word into English would mean a sage. Hindu scriptures and Hindu mythology tell about a number of rishis. They describe a rishi as an old person, with a lot of knowledge and wisdom. They also say that some of the rishis had great powers, and sometimes even some gods of Hindus like Indra were afraid of rishis. Some of the rishis were famous for becoming angry very quickly and easily. Their anger sometimes resulted in the rishis cursing people. 

Rishis used to live in deep forests. Many young men from villages and towns also lived with them as their students and disciples. Rishis taught them in schools called Gurukuls. After education, these young men returned to live with their families. However, some of them shall always remain with the rishis as their disciples. Sometimes, even kings and other members of the ruling families would go to them to seek advice and blessings. Sometimes these rishis and their disciples would go to the royal courts and participate in discussions there. 

Seven such rishis were the most famous. Hindu scriptures have named them as saptarishis, that is, the seven sages. The seven sages were Kashyapa, Atri, Vashitha, Vishvamitra, Gautam, Jamdagni, and Bharadvaja. According to Hindu mythology, these seven sages had become like divine beings. Ancient astrology of Hindus identified these seven sages with the stars of the sky, the Great Bear. Their wives formed the Pleiades.

[[Down syndrome]]

CATEGORIES: Trisomies

Down syndrome (or trisomy 21; old name mongoloid idiocy) is a genetic disorder. People with Down syndrome have an extra copy of chromosome 21, or part of it.

Down syndrome causes a mental handicap. It may be mild or severe. The average IQ of a young adult with Down syndrome is 50, equivalent to the mental age of an 8- or 9-year-old child, but it truly depends on the person. This can vary widely, but most individuals need supervision if they are to live their lives in a satisfactory way. Children who have this condition take more time to learn new things.

The condition is named after John Langdon Down, the British doctor who first described it in 1866. He called it mongoloid idiocy because he thought that children with Down syndrome had faces like that of Blumenbach's Mongolian race. Idiocy meant intellectual disability. People do not use the term "mongoloid idiocy" today. It is a rude term.

There is sometimes discrimination against people with Down syndrome, both in the education system and in society in general. Some people with the condition have average intelligence, but may have other problems with development instead. People with Down syndrome often have a different shape of eyes than most people. A few people with the condition have severe learning difficulties.

Of every 800 to 1000 babies that are born, one is diagnosed with Down syndrome. Older women have a higher chance of having a baby with Down syndrome. If they have a procedure known as amniocentesis, pregnant mothers can be told whether their foetus has Down syndrome. Sound scans may also diagnose the presence of Down Syndrome. Mothers whose foetus is diagnosed as having Downs syndrome may choose to have an abortion. In the United Kingdom and Europe 92% of such cases are aborted.

[[Genetic disorder]]

CATEGORIES: Genetic disorders

A genetic disorder is a health problem caused by abnormalities in the genome. They are heritable, and may be passed down from the parents' genes to their children and to later generations. If a genetic disorder is present from birth, it is described as a congenital defect. Some defects only show up in later life.  

The mutation responsible can occur spontaneously before the embryo develops, or it can be inherited from parents who are carriers of a faulty gene.

Most genetic disorders are quite rare and affect one person in every several thousands or even millions. Sometimes they are relatively frequent in a population. If they are frequent, it suggests these recessive gene disorders give an advantage in certain environments when only one copy of the gene is present. Sickle cell anaemia is an example of this.

The same disease, such as some forms of cancer, may be caused by an inherited genetic condition in some people, by new mutations in other people, and by nongenetic causes in still other people. A disease is only called a genetic disease if it can be inherited.

[[Vulva]]

CATEGORIES: Anatomy of the female reproductive system

The vulva is the part of the body of female mammals (including women) where the outside parts of the reproductive system can be seen. The parts of the vulva that can be seen are the:

The mons pubis is the area of skin and fat above the other structures. It protects the other structures below it. The labia majora are thick areas of skin and fat located to the side of the urinary and vaginal openings. Smaller and thinner labia are the labia minora. These structures are connected to the hood of the clitoris . They are close to the vagina. Many people call the vagina when they mean the vulva. The vagina is the tube connecting the internal parts (the womb) to the vulva.

[[Congruence]]

CATEGORIES: Geometry

More formally, two sets of  points are called congruent, if and only if one can be transformed into the other by isometry. For isometry, rigid motions are used.

This means that two geometrical figures are congruent if one object can be repositioned, rotated or reflected—but not resized—so that it coincides exactly with the other object. if one can be moved or rotated so that it fits exactly where the other one is, then the two figures are congruent. If one of the object has to change its size, then the two objects are not congruent: they are just called similar.

As an example, two distinct plane figures on a piece of paper are congruent if we can cut them out and then match them up completely (turning the paper over here is permitted).

Congruent polygons are polygons that if you fold a regular polygon in half that is a congruent polygon.September 2020

[[Deism]]

CATEGORIES: Theology

Deism is the belief that a higher being (like the Christian God) exists, but that the only revelation of God is in nature and reason, not in sacred books or prophets. Deism says that people should rely on logic and reason, and not traditions of a religion that is based on a holy book. People who follow deism are called deists.

Deists believe that a Higher Power created the world. They do not believe that the creation of the universe happened because of a spontaneous event. They usually reject supernatural events like miracles, and believe that God has set up natural laws, which govern how the universe works and how people should act, and does not interfere with these laws. Most deists also see holy books, such as the Bible and Qur'an, as writings made by people, rather than the writings of God.

Famous deists from history include American political leader and inventor Benjamin Franklin, French conqueror Napoleon Bonaparte, French philosopher Voltaire, British philosopher Thomas Paine, and French revolutionary leader Maximilien de Robespierre. Many historians think Thomas Jefferson was a deist, though he didn't say so. 

[[Cleveland Indians]]

CATEGORIES: Cleveland Indians

The Cleveland Indians are a Major League Baseball team. They are part of the American League Central Division. The Indians won two World Series championships in 1920 and 1948.  Currently, they hold the longest championship drought in baseball.

In their early years, they were often called the Cleveland Naps, in honor of the player-manager Nap Lajoie. After he retired, the team looked for a new nickname. They settled on "Indians" for the 1915 season, partly in honor of the Boston Braves who had won the 1914 World Series. In more modern times, their nickname is often thought to be a poor choice. It is considered offensive to name a team for a race or ethnic group. However, there has been no serious effort to change the name.

In the 1990s, the Indians were in the postseason several times.  They made it to the World Series in 1995 and 1997 but lost to the Atlanta Braves and the Florida Marlins respectively.  They returned to the World Series in 2016, and again they lost, this time to the Chicago Cubs in seven games.  In 2017, they set an American League record of winning 22 straight games.  They won 102 games during the season.  However, they lost to the New York Yankees in the Division Series.

[[Occitan language]]

CATEGORIES: Romance languages, Languages of Europe

Occitan (lang; ɔk.si'tɑ̃; utsiˈta), known also as lenga d'òc by its native speakers (ˈleŋɡɔ ˈðɔ(k); langue d'oc), is a Romance language spoken in the south of France, the Occitan Valleys of Italy, the Val d'Aran of Catalonia and Monaco. The regions together are sometimes known unofficially as Occitania.

Occitan took a different path from Latin to the main official languages. It is sometimes called lenga d'òc ("language of oc", French: langue d'oc) because its word for yes is òc, as opposed to oil (oui) or sì in other languages. That is one way to classify Romance languages.

Occitan is an official language of Catalonia. Since September 2010, the Parliament of Catalonia has considered Aranese Occitan to be the officially preferred language for use in the Val d'Aran.

[[Bass (singer)]]

CATEGORIES: Vocal ranges

A singer who is a bass is a man with a low singing voice.  Some basses may be able to sing down to C two octaves below middle C.  Even low A is sometimes needed in Russian church music.

In opera, basses often have the part of the villain, or the king, or a priest. A buffo-bass is a character role in which the bass singer needs a wide range for the comedy of the part.  The part of Leporello in Mozart's Don Giovanni needs a buffo bass.  The lowest kind of bass is called a basso-profondo.  An example is the priest Sarastro in Mozart's Magic Flute.

Feodor Chaliapin (1873-1938) was a famous Russian bass.

Southern gospel singer J.D. Sumner held the world record for lowest bass singer for a number of years, from 1988 until he was beaten by Tim Storms in 2016

A baritone is a voice between tenor and bass in range, but some low baritones describe themselves as bass-baritones. Wotan in Der Ring des Nibelungen is a bass-baritone part. Bryn Terfel is a famous Welsh bass-baritone.

Johnny Cash is well-known for his bass-baritone voice 

[[Plankton]]

CATEGORIES: Biological oceanography, Ecology

Plankton are drifting organisms that live in the surface layers of the ocean. They live in the top layer of the ocean, called the epipelagic zone. They are not strong enough to swim against ocean currents. The term is in contrast to nekton, who can control their movements. There are three groups:

Plankton are important in the ocean's food chain. They are the main source of food for almost all fish larvae as they switch from their yolk sacs to catching prey. Basking sharks and blue whales feed on them directly; other large fish feed on them indirectly, by eating fish of smaller size, such as herrings.

The distribution of plankton is governed more by nutrients than by temperature. Large tracts of ocean are blue and sterile. The reason is that these areas lack one or more crucial nutrients for the photosynthetic plankton, upon whom all the others depend. Broadly speaking, areas near land masses get nutrients by rivers and wind. The key nutrient lacking in the Pacific ocean is iron, essential in molecules such as ferredoxins, iron-sulfur proteins which do electron transfer in a range of metabolic reactions.

[[Pharmacology]]

CATEGORIES: Drugs, Pharmacology

Pharmacology is the study of how medicine and other things have an effect on living organisms and change how they function. Pharmacology could also be defined as the study of how medicine actually works.

Pharmacology is not exactly the same as pharmacy, and a pharmacologist is not exactly the same as a pharmacist. A pharmacologist is a scientist who studies how medicine actually works, and usually works in a science lab.  A pharmacist is a health care provider who usually works at a pharmacy.  However, there is quite a bit of overlap between these two fields. A pharmacist could be considered a type of pharmacologist. While in school, pharmacists do take many classes in pharmacology.

[[Indo-European languages]]

CATEGORIES: Indo-European languages

The Indo-European languages are the world's most spoken language family. 

Linguists believe they all come from a single language, Proto-Indo-European, which was originally spoken somewhere in Eurasia. They are now spoken all over the world.

The Indo-European languages are a family of several hundred related languages and dialects, including most major languages in Europe, the Iranian plateau, and South Asia.

Historically, the language family was also important in Anatolia and Central Asia. 

The earliest Indo-European writing is from the Bronze Age in Anatolian and Mycenaean Greek. The origin of Proto-Indo-European is after the invention of farming since some of its words have to do with farming.

Although it may have fewer languages than some other language families, it has the most native speakers, about 2.7 billion. 

Of the 20 languages with the most speakers, 12 are Indo-European: English, Spanish, Hindi, Portuguese, Bengali, Russian, German, Sindhi, Punjabi, Marathi, French, and Urdu.

Four of the six official languages of the United Nations are Indo-European: English, Spanish, French, and Russian.

[[Pneumonia]]

CATEGORIES: Infectious diseases, Pulmonology

Pneumonia is a disease of the lungs and the respiratory system. The lung contains many small bulbs, or sacs, called alveoli. These help to take out oxygen from the air. In the case of pneumonia, these bulbs become inflamed. They fill up with a fluid which is called pus, and can no longer absorb as much oxygen as before. This makes it hard for the person with pneumonia to breathe. They may feel out of breath, or like they are drowning.  They may also feel pain when they breathe.  Sometimes people die of pneumonia, even when they go to a hospital and take medicine.

[[Pathogen]]

A pathogen is an infectious thing, such as a virus, bacteria, fungi or parasite, which causes a disease. This ability is called pathogenicity.

The body has many ways to defend against some of the common pathogens (such as Pneumocystis) in the form of the human immune system and by some "helpful" bacteria present in the human body's normal human flora. However, if the immune system or "good" bacteria is damaged in any way (for example, chemotherapy, HIV, or antibiotics being taken to kill other pathogens), pathogenic bacteria that were being held back can grow and cause harm to the host. Such cases are opportunistic infections.

Some pathogens cause epidemics. These include the bacterium Yersinia pestis which may have caused the Black Death, the Variola virus, and the malarial protozoa. They hurt or even kill large numbers of people. 

The most famous and lethal outbreak was the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic (type A influenza, H1N1 subtype), which lasted from 1918 to 1919. It is not known exactly how many it killed, but estimates range from 20 to 100 million people. This pandemic has been described as "the greatest medical holocaust in history" and may have killed as many people as the Black Death. 

The huge death toll was caused by an extremely high infection rate of up to 50% and the extreme severity of the symptoms. One observer wrote, "One of the most striking of the complications was hemorrhage from mucous membranes, especially from the nose, stomach, and intestine. Bleeding from the ears and skin also occurred". The majority of deaths were from bacterial pneumonia, a secondary infection caused by influenza, but the virus also killed people directly, causing massive bleeding and oedema in the lungs.

In plants, fungi are the main cause of infectious disease.

[[Pesticide]]

CATEGORIES: Poisons, Gardening

A pesticide is a chemical that is used to kill or prevent small animals (or organisms) which are considered to be unwanted. These organisms are called pests. Some of these pests that people do not want are insects, microbes that destroy plants, and other things that affect humans in a bad way and it may kill humans too. Many pesticides are poisonous, and are bad for not only the organisms they kill, but for humans too. A pesticide also affects the environment

and the atmosphere. 

The Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants lists chemicals that are very hard to destroy, or very toxic. In total, twelve chemicals are listed. Nine of them can be used as pesticides.

[[Inhalation]]

CATEGORIES: Respiratory system

Inhalation is half of what occurs when people or animals breathe. Air is moved from the outside through the respiratory system into the lungs. The lungs take out some oxygen and put it into the blood. Drugs can also be inhaled with an inhaler to put them into the blood. The air is then moved out of the lungs again. This is the other half of breathing, called exhalation.

[[Severe acute respiratory syndrome]]

CATEGORIES: Diseases caused by viruses, Pulmonology, Coronaviruses, Zoonoses

Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)  was an atypical pneumonia. It started in November 2002 in Guangdong Province, in the city of Foshan, of the People's Republic of China. The disease was caused by the SARS coronavirus (SARS CoV), a new coronavirus. It was also a part-time STD, it can be spread through both sexual and casual contact. 

SARS is a zoonosis: it is a disease which comes from animals: it came from  Asian palm civets to cave-dwelling horseshoe bats. Exactly how the virus got to humans is not known.

SARS was first reported in Asia in February 2003. Over the next few months, the illness spread to more than 24 countries in Asia, North America, South America, and Europe before the SARS global outbreak of 2003 was contained. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), a total of 8098 people worldwide became sick with SARS during the 2003 outbreak; 774 of these died. 

After the Chinese government suppressed news of the SARS outbreak, the disease spread rapidly, reaching Hong Kong and Vietnam in late February 2003, and then to other countries via international travellers. The last case in this outbreak occurred in June 2003. There were a total of 8437 known cases of the disease, with 813 deaths (a mortality rate of 9.636%).

In May 2005 the disease itself was declared 'eradicated' by the WHO and it became the second disease in mankind to receive this label (the other was smallpox). The New York Times reported that "not a single case of severe acute respiratory syndrome has been reported this year or in late 2004. It is the first winter without a case since the initial outbreak in late 2002. Also, the epidemic strain of SARS that caused at least 813 deaths worldwide by June of 2003 has not been seen outside a laboratory since then."

Rudolf Christian Karl Diesel (March 18, 1858 – September 30, 1913) was a German engineer and inventor. His best known invention is Diesel engine. He was born in Paris and died on the English Channel.

He had the idea to develop an engine which relied on a high compression of the fuel to ignite it. With this he could do without a spark. The technique with a spark was developed by Niklaus Otto. The engine based on this is called internal combustion engine.

In 1892 he got a patent for the engine.

He got a lot of money from licensing his invention.

[[Cloudberry]]

CATEGORIES: Rubus

A cloudberry (Rubus chamaemorus) is a herbaceous plant in alpine, tundra and boreal forest. The fruit is an amber-colored edible fruit similar to the raspberry or blackberry.

Despite great demand as a delicacy (particularly in Russia, Norway, Sweden and Finland) the cloudberry is not widely cultivated. It is mainly a wild plant. Wholesale prices vary widely by the size of the yearly harvest, but cloudberries have gone for as much as €10/kg (in 2004). 

The ripe fruits are golden-yellow, soft and juicy, and are rich in vitamin C. When eaten fresh, cloudberries have a distinctive tart taste. When over-ripe, they have a creamy texture somewhat like yogurt, and a sweetened flavour. They are often made into jams, juices, tarts, and liqueurs. They are very popular in Scandinavia.

The plant spreads by two means. Its seeds are spread by birds and mammals. Locally, its rhizomes develop into wide berry patches.

[[Migration]]

CATEGORIES: Ecology, Zoology, Ethology, Migration

Migration is when animals move on a regular cycle. For example, caribou in the Arctic go south in winter and return in summer when it is warmer. Many birds migrate, such as geese and storks.

Migration is the travelling of long distances in search of a new habitat. The trigger for the migration may be local climate, local availability of food, or the season of the year. To be counted as a true migration, and not just a local dispersal, the movement should be an annual or seasonal event.

Many birds fly to warmer places for the winter, as do some insects such as the migratory locust. Young Atlantic salmon leave the river of their birth when they have reached a few inches (cm) in size.

Many species in the sea have a daily migration. Plankton go up for the day where there is light, and down at night, where they are less easy to find. The many species which feed on them follow them up and down.

Migration is an evolutionary force. This is because it is a major source of natural selection. The success of migratory animals to make the journey is usually needed for them to reproduce.

Many parts of the world have a strongly seasonal climate. In order to survive, many species need to breed in one place and, later, eat in another place. The simplest example is the African herbivores, who follow the growth of grass in East Africa. This region has seasonal rainfall, and so it has seasonal growth of grass. Their predators follow them.

[[Original sin]]

CATEGORIES: Christian theology

The concept of original sin refers generally to the Christian belief in the universal nature of sin. Original sin is considered to be the result of the story of Adam and Eve in The Bible.  In that story (Genesis 3), God only made one rule for them: They must not eat fruit from the tree of knowledge of good and evil. But the snake told Eve, that eating the fruit would make Eve like God. Eve then persuaded Adam to eat the fruit. After they had broken  God's only rule, they were removed from the Garden of Eden.

Then Genesis tells the story of how their oldest son Cain killed his brother Abel. Based mostly on this and many other stories and passages in the Bible and Saint Paul's statement in Romans 5:12 (Sin entered the world because one man, Adam, sinned, and death came because of sin. Everyone sinned, so death came to all people.--NIV), Christians traditionally believe that no human is without sin.  

More specifically the term "original sin" refers to the state of being part of the human race. This was first explained fully by Saint Augustine in his writings against the Pelagians. The Eastern Orthodox Churches do not believe in this specific doctrine of Original Sin.

[[Genetic engineering]]

CATEGORIES: Genetic engineering

Genetic engineering (GE), also called genetic modification, is a branch of applied biology. It is the changing of an organism's genome using biotechnology. These methods are recent discoveries. The techniques are advanced, and full details are not given here.

This is an overview of what can be done: 

An organism that is altered by genetic engineering is a genetically modified organism (GMO). The first GMOs were bacteria in 1973; GM mice were made in 1974. Insulin-producing bacteria were commercialized in 1982. Genetically modified food has been sold since 1994, including crops.

Genetic engineering techniques have been used in research, agriculture, industrial biotechnology, and medicine. Enzymes used in laundry detergent, and medicines such as insulin and human growth hormone are now manufactured in GM cells. GM animals such as mice or zebrafish are being used for research purposes.

Critics have objected to use of genetic engineering on several grounds, including ethical concerns, ecological concerns. Economic concerns are raised by the fact GM techniques and GM organisms are subject to intellectual property law. Ecological concerns are more subtle. There is a risk that some genetically modified (GM) organisms may be better adapted to some niche in nature, and will take away some the habitat of the regular species.

[[Hunting]]

CATEGORIES: Sports involving animals, Animal rights, Hunting

Hunting is going out to find and kill animals. Animals and some humans, hunt for food. People have hunted at least since the stone age. They used spears, and now people mostly use guns and bows. Some people kill the animals for fur, to make clothes and shelter, or to decorate their homes, or to sell. Fox hunting is sometimes a sport.

Many places have rules that limit hunting. Hunting can be good by keeping animal populations from getting too high. Hunting too much, though, can kill off species of animals, making them extinct. Hunting once made the dodo, a bird, become extinct.

Before they invented herding people got meat by hunting.  Boar hunting and fox hunting became became popular in early modern times.  Another form of hunting is not to use guns, bows and arrows or spears, but by animal trapping.   

Animal rights activists oppose to hunting. Anti-hunting laws (English Hunting Act 2004) strive to reduce hunting.

[[Tycho Brahe]]

CATEGORIES: 1546 births, 1601 deaths, Astrologers, Astronomers, Danish scientists

Tycho Brahe  (14 December 1546 — 24 October 1601) was an astronomer from Denmark. He observed the night sky before the invention of the telescope. He built a large observatory called Uraniborg on the island of Hven in Denmark. 

He discovered that the universe outside the Solar System could change when he studied a supernova and a comet. Johannes Kepler was his assistant. Tycho made very careful observations of the planets. When Tycho died in 1601, Kepler continued Tycho's work.

Tycho was not a modern scientist. He believed in astrology, and his astronomy was a strange mixture of scientific observation and religious belief. Although he rejected the Ptolemaic system, he also rejected the Copernican system. He developed a geocentric theory that imagined the Sun and Moon orbited the Earth, but the other planets orbited the Sun. 

Unlike most astronomers of his time, he did not believe in the unchanging celestial realm or spheres. Tycho's Nova, now called SN 1572,proved that changes did take place. Also, he worked out that comets were real celestial objects, and that their orbits were different to those of the planets.

[[Ellipse]]

CATEGORIES: shapes, Conic sections

An ellipse  is a shape that looks like an oval or a flattened circle. 

In geometry, an ellipse is a plane curve which results from the intersection of a cone by a plane in a way that produces a closed curve.  

Circles are special cases of ellipses, obtained when the cutting plane is perpendicular to the cone's axis.  An ellipse is also the locus of all points of the plane whose distances to two fixed points add to the same constant.

A circle has one center, called a focus, but an ellipse has two foci. 

An ellipse is simply all points on a graph that the sum of the distances from 2 points are the same. For example, an ellipse can be made by putting two pins into cardboard and a circle of string around those two, then putting a pencil in the loop and pulling as far as possible without breaking the string in all directions. The orbits of the planets are ellipses, with the sun at one focus and nothing at the other.  

where the center of the ellipse is (h,k). 2A is the length from each end of the longer skinnier side.  2b is the length of the 2 ends of the short side.  A²-B²=C² for c is the length between the foci and the center.

[[Mantra]]

CATEGORIES: Hinduism, Hindu mythology

In Hinduism and Hindu mythology, Mantra means a group of words. There are many such groups of words. Some mantras have meanings. However, there are many mantras which are just syllables, with or without any words. Such mantras do not carry meanings. From the ancient times, Hindus, as well as in many cases, texts of Buddhism and Jainism contain many mantras.

Traditionally, people associate the mantras with various powers. However, it is more a matter of individual faith and experience than a fact of science.

The earliest examples of mantras are many hymns and verses of Vedas. People read them aloud. They thought that by doing so they would get the blessings of the gods and other beings. The system continued in Hindu practices of worship and meditation. Even now, many Hindus believe in the power of mantras to gain health and wealth. Mantras may form part of worship or people may simply recite them loudly or slowly. Some time no recitation may take place, and the person would just think of the mantra silently for long time.

The line originally marked the military front when the two countries declared a ceasefire on 1/2 January 1949. The fronts gradually became a solid boundary. It was formally named the Line of Control after the Simla Agreement, which was signed on 3 July 1972.

All of Kashmir was previously the princely state of Kashmir and Jammu. The part of the region that is now under Indian control is known as the State of Jammu and Kashmir.

[[Microcode]]

CATEGORIES: Microprocessor design

Microcode is the name for a number of instructions or data structures which are involved in implementing higher-level machine language in many processors, especially microprogrammed ones. Microcode is on memory that is very fast to access. When a machine level instruction needs to be executed, microcode tells the processor what electronic circuits should be used. When a new processor is designed, an engineer also writes the microcode for the instructions of machine language. This is called Microprogramming, the resulting code is called a microprogram. 

In early processors, each instruction was hard-wired. This has several drawbacks, the most obvious is that correcting an error in processor design means that the processor needs to be replaced. 

[[Computational complexity theory]]

CATEGORIES: Theoretical computer science

Computational complexity theory is a part of computer science. It looks at algorithms, and tries to say how many steps or how much memory a certain algorithm takes for a computer to do. Very often, algorithms that use fewer steps use more memory (or the other way round: if there is less memory available, it takes more steps to do). Many interesting algorithms take a number of steps that is dependent on the size of the problem.

[[Average]]

CATEGORIES: Mathematics

An average is the "normal" number of a group of numbers made by mixing the group of numbers.

[[Romanization]]

CATEGORIES: Romanization, Culture

Romanization, or Latinization, is the process by which words and languages that normally do not use the Latin alphabet are converted into Latin letters. That allows people who do not know the original writing system to read the sounds of the language. Romanization is one way to show the pronunciation of the language's words.

There are often several standards for romanizing one language. For the Russian language ,the Soviet Union invented several systems, and the United Nations and the International Organization for Standardization invented two of the others. Methods for Arabic, Japanese, and Chinese are similarly diverse. Some romanization systems are based on transcription, some are based on transliteration, and some are based on both.

Transcription occurs when the effect at the end is that both the original and the transcribed version sound the same, whether or not each letter alone in one text matches the corresponding letter in the other one.

Transliteration occurs when the effect at the end is for the letters to match one to one, whether or not the sound is the same.

[[Diaspora]]

[[Sequence]]

CATEGORIES: Mathematics, Words

A sequence is a word meaning "a set of related events, movements or items that follow each other in a particular order".

It is used in mathematics and other disciplines. In ordinary use, it means a series of events, one following another. In maths, a sequence is made up of several things put together, one after the other. The order that the things are in matters. For example, both (Blue, Red, Yellow) and (Yellow, Blue, Red) are sequences, but they are not the same. Sequences made up of numbers are also called progressions.

There are two kinds of sequences. One kind is finite sequences, which have an end. For example, (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) is a finite sequence. The other kind is infinite sequences, which means that they keep going and never end. An example of a sequence that is infinite is the sequence of all even numbers, bigger than 0. This sequence never ends: it starts with 2, 4, 6, and so on, and one can always keep on naming even numbers.

For example, the rule could be that the thing in the n-th place is the number 2×n (2 times n). This tells us what the whole sequence is, even though it never ends. The first number is 2×1, which is 2. The second number is 2×2, or 4. If we want to know what the 100-th number is, we can simply calculate 2×100 and get 200. No matter which thing in the sequence we want, the rule can tell us what it is.

[[OpenGL]]

CATEGORIES: Free software, Graphics software

OpenGL (Open Graphics Library) is a programming interface for 3D graphics which helps computer programmers make their 3D graphics perform better and faster by running parts of their programs on a video card (GPU) rather than just the central processor (CPU). Programming interfaces like OpenGL are usually called an "API," which stands for "Application Programming Interface".

OpenGL is often compared to Direct3D, an API for 3D graphics on Windows. Programming for Direct3D is different in some ways because the APIs use different naming schemes for talking to a computer's graphics driver, which means that programmers need to write different code for OpenGL and Direct3D to do the same things.

OpenGL is owned by the Khronos Group, and is an example of open source software. This means that all of OpenGL's programming, and the explanations for how the programming all works, can be viewed, copied, revised, and re-released by anyone.

[[Māori]]

[[Māori language]]

CATEGORIES: Austronesian languages, Languages of Oceania, Māori language

The Māori language (Te Reo Māori, shortened to Te Reo) is the language of the Māori and an official language of New Zealand. It is an Austronesian language.

Although it is an official language, not many people speak it fluently. In the 2013 census, about 149,000 people, (3.7% of the population) said that they could have a conversation in Māori about a lot of everyday things. 

The language can be seen everywhere throughout New Zealand, as many of the placenames are Māori, such as Whangarei, Rotorua, and Timaru. Lots of government or city buildings use te reo on their signs as well as English, and most of the public schools have a Māori name as well as an English one.

Te Reo Māori did not have a writing system until the Europeans arrived. In 1817, a Ngāpuhi chief, Tītori, and his relative Tui worked with Professor Samuel Lee and prepared a writing system for te reo.

McCarthyism is the term describing a period of intense anti-Communist suspicion in the United States that lasted roughly from the late 1940s to the mid to late 1950s. The term gets its name  from U.S. Senator Joseph McCarthy, a Republican of Wisconsin. The period of McCarthyism is also referred to as the Second Red Scare. It happened at the same times as increased fears of Communist influence on American institutions, espionage by Soviet agents such as the Rosenbergs, heightened tension from Soviet control over Eastern Europe, the success of the Chinese Communist revolution (1949) and the Korean War (1950-1953). There is a play called 'The Crucible' which is about the beginning of the Salem witch trials but also McCarthyism.

[[Syphilis]]

CATEGORIES: Sexually transmitted diseases, Diseases caused by bacteria

Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection caused by a bacterium called Treponema pallidum.  Syphilis is usually spread by sexual contact.  However, a fetus can get syphilis from its mother while she is pregnant or during childbirth.  This is called congenital syphilis.

There are four stages of syphilis: the primary, secondary, latent, and tertiary stages.  In each stage, the signs and symptoms of syphilis are different.

In the primary stage, a person usually just has a wound on their skin, called a "chancre."  In the secondary stage, a person usually gets a rash.  In the "latent" stage, syphilis has few or no symptoms.  If syphilis reaches the tertiary stage, which is the most severe, it causes many serious symptoms.  These can include problems with the nervous system (the brain and nerves) and problems with the heart.  Eventually, many people with tertiary syphilis will die if they do not get medical treatment.

Syphilis is usually diagnosed with blood tests.  The bacteria that causes syphilis can also be seen under a microscope.  Most people who have syphilis can be treated and cured with antibiotics.

By 1999, more than 12 million people around the world had gotten syphilis.  More than 90% of these people (10.8 million) lived in the developing world.  Syphilis got much less common after penicillin became available in the 1940s.  At that time, penicillin was used as a treatment for syphilis, and often cured the disease.  However, since 2000, syphilis is becoming more common again.

Syphilis can be a very dangerous disease if it is not treated.  Without treatment, 8% to 58% of people with syphilis die from the disease.  Syphilis also makes a person two to five times more likely to get Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).

[[Gonorrhea]]

CATEGORIES: Sexually transmitted diseases, Diseases caused by bacteria

Gonorrhea is a disease. It is transmitted by having sex. It is among the most widespread sexually transmitted diseases.  Gonorrhea is also sometimes called "the clap."  Gonorrhea can be cured using antibiotics but the entire course of antibiotics must be used.

[[Dozen]]

CATEGORIES: Numbers

A "dozen" is a unit of measurement. It means twelve (12) items of something. The term goes back to duodecim, which means 12 in  Latin. Humans might have started to count on a base 12 because there are approximately 12 cycles of the moon in one cycle of the sun. In other words, a solar year has 12 months. The first to have used the unit were probably the Mesopotamians.

12 dozen  (144 items) are a gross. 12 gross (1728 items) are called a great gross. 

A great hundred is 120 or ten dozen (a dozen for each finger on both hands).

The dozen is convenient because its multipliers and multiples are convenient: 12 = 3 × 2 × 2, and 360 = 30 × 12. The French word douzaine means "about twelve" and is part of a family of words with similar meanings, e.g. vingtaine – "about 20"  centaine – "about 100"  etc. A baker's dozen, also known as a long dozen, is thirteen.

Examples:

I have a dozen doughnuts 

there is a dozen of members in a team

[[Atlantic herring]]

CATEGORIES: Clupeiformes

The Atlantic herring is a kind of herring, a fish. It can be found on both sides of the Atlantic. It can grow up to 45cm in length, weighing more than half a kilogram. It is a swarm fish, meaning many fish come together and form a school (or swarm) of fish. Swarms of up to 4 cubic kilometers in size have been measured of atlantic herring, with an eastimated 4 billion individual fish. Like with so many other fishes though, commercial overfishing is posing a problem. Stocks of herring have been collapsing. 

Their natural predators are seals, cod, other large fish as well as some kinds of whales. 

The current reason for the overfishing is the need of the Omega Fatty Acid, which helps increase memory, and brain functions.

[[Florence Nightingale]]

CATEGORIES: 1820 births, 1910 deaths, Nurses, Unitarians, Order of Merit, People from Florence, People from London

Florence Nightingale, OM (12 May 1820 – 13 August 1910), was an English nurse. She helped create the modern techniques of nursing. She became a leader of the team of nurses who helped wounded soldiers during the Crimean War. 

She was the first female to receive the Order of Merit, one of the highest honours awarded by the British monarch. As a nurse she was given the name 'The Lady with the Lamp' because at night, she checked on the wounded soldiers and always carried 'The Lamp' with her. Florence Nightingale was a wonderful woman, coming from a wealthy family she refused the aristocrat lifestyle her family expected from her and instead focused on helping the poor, the injured and the sick. She helped make modern nursing possible. Nightingale was a prodigious and versatile writer, and lived to be 90 years old.

In her lifetime she was concerned with spreading medical knowledge. Some of her books were written in simple English so that they could easily be understood by those with poor reading skills. She also was an early user of graphs  and diagrams to display data.

Nightingale was helped to understand statistics by her country's leading expert on public statistics, William Farr. He was a founder of medical statistics, and epidemiology. Farr worked with her on all the statistics from the Crimean War, which she publicised in her writing. She proved that more men had died from disease than fighting, a very important piece of information. The disease in question was mostly cholera. Cholera is caused by a bacterium spread by people drinking water contaminated by sewage. Unfortunately, both she and Farr believed the disease was caused by foul air: this was called the miasma theory.

The miasma theory was refuted by John Snow, who discovered the real cause of an outbreak in London. The cause was foul water from a water pump in Broad Street, London. Snow's work was published in 1855, but it was 30 years before the germ theory was generally accepted. Farr publicly acknowledged he was wrong in 1866, but Nightingale never really gave up the miasma idea. London's cholera epidemics stopped once the authorities built sewage treatment plants, delivered cleaner water, and built a system of underground pipes that kept sewage from seeping into the water supply.

Apocalypse Now is a 1979 American epic drama movie directed by Francis Ford Coppola.

It tells a fictional story which takes place in the 1960s during the Vietnam War. It tells the story of an Army Captain who is sent on a boat deep into the Cambodian jungle to capture a Special Forces colonel who, it is suggested, has gone insane. It was partly based on Joseph Conrad's novel about a journey down the Congo River, Heart of Darkness.

It is now thought to be a great movie, but in the making it ran into problems. Its key star Martin Sheen, is on the screen for almost all the movie. He had a breakdown, and a heart attack. Editing the mile plus of film took years. It was unfinished when it was shown in the Cannes Film Festival.

Apocalypse Now is today considered to be one of the greatest films ever made. It was nominated for eight Academy Awards at the 52nd Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director (Coppola), and Best Supporting Actor for Robert Duvall. It went on to win for Best Cinematography and Best Sound. It ranked #14 in Sight & Sound's greatest films poll in 2012, and #6 in the Director's Poll of greatest films of all time.

The film as now shown on streaming channels is the Director's "Final Cut". This was first shown in 2019 at the Tribeca Film Festival. It runs for 3 hours, 3 minutes.

Cincinnati is a city in the southwestern corner of the state of Ohio near the states of Kentucky and Indiana. The city is in Hamilton County, Ohio. Cincinnati is home to major sports teams including the Cincinnati Reds and the Cincinnati Bengals, as well as events like the Cincinnati Masters and the Thanksgiving Day race. The University of Cincinnati traces its foundation to the Medical College of Ohio, which was founded in 1819.

Cincinnati was named after the Roman leader Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus and was an early major city in the midwestern United States. Many Germans settled in the city and the Over-the-Rhine neighborhood gets its name from the river in Germany. Soap and machine tools are major industries in the area, which is home to the company Procter & Gamble as well as Macy's. Cincinnati's economy and population declined in the late 1900s, but the city is on the upswing. The Over-The-Rhine neighborhood has seen a lot of new businesses and development in recent years.

[[Castrato]]

CATEGORIES: Vocal ranges

A castrato (plural castrati) was a type of male singer with a very high voice. The effect was produced either through castration, or because of some hormonal problems. The word castrato literally means castrated. Such singers were very sought after in the early days of the opera. Most of the main soprano roles in operas by Handel and other composers of that time were written for castrati. Nowadays they are almost always sung by female sopranos, since there are no castrati left.

The practice of castrating young boys who had good singing voices was quite common in Italy in the 17th century. When castration is done before puberty, the usual effects of puberty will not happen. These include the vocal cords enlarging and growing bigger, and the voice getting deeper as a consequence. 

Even though castration was illegal in many parts of Italy, it was often performed. Many families who were poor had their children castrated because it might give them a better future. 

Once a boy was castrated he would go to a special music school where children learned singing and musical instruments. The castrati pupils were given special treatment. They were fussed over and kept warm to stop them from getting colds. When they grew up they hoped to become famous opera singers. A few of them had very successful careers in opera. They were the great stars of their day, and audiences came to the opera to cheer on their favourite singers. Those who were not good enough to make a career in opera joined church choirs instead.

It is impossible now for us to know what these great castrato voices sounded like, but they must have had very powerful voices and many of the singers were very skilled in singing and adding musical ornamentation to the songs. In the 18th century Italian opera became very popular in England. This was largely due to the German-born composer Georg Friderich Händel who moved to England in 1709 and wrote lots of Italian operas. Many singers who sang in London came from Italy, and many were castrati. The most famous one was called Farinelli. 

The popularity of castrato singers died out in the 19th century when operas became less artificial and more like real life. By the mid-19th century they were no opera castrati left, although a few castrati still sang in church choirs. The last one, a man called Alessandro Moreschi, died in 1922 aged 64. There is a recording of his voice made in 1902 which can be heard online, but he may not have been a good singer and he was old when he made the recording, so we cannot judge whether the castrato voice was beautiful by that recording.

[[Falsetto]]

CATEGORIES: Vocal ranges

A falsetto voice is a special way of speaking or singing. If a man tries to imitate a woman’s voice he does it by speaking in a falsetto voice. When a man sings with a falsetto voice it sounds high like a soprano. Actors do this sometimes, e.g. Robin Williams in the film Mrs Doubtfire or Kevin Clash when voicing the character Elmo in Sesame Street and Barry Gibb of the Bee Gees, with his R&B falsetto. Also, Kellin Quinn from the band sleeping With Sirens uses falsetto sometimes.

Women can also use falsetto, but when they do there is not as big of a change in sound from their normal voices as there is in men. When women use falsetto the voice sounds lighter or weaker than it does when they speak or sing normally.

It is like stretching the mouth out into a wide smile and saying 'ee', except it is sung.

[[Countertenor]]

CATEGORIES: Vocal ranges

A countertenor is a male singer who uses a falsetto voice to sing high notes like a female contralto or mezzo-soprano.

Countertenors were used a lot in the Renaissance and Baroque periods when females were not allowed to sing in church choirs. They did not have big, dramatic voices like castrati, so they were not normally used in opera. People forgot about this way of singing in the 18th and 19th centuries, although male altos continued to sing in English cathedral and church choirs. In the 20th century an English countertenor called Alfred Deller became very famous. He sang many songs from the Baroque period that had been written for the countertenor voice, for example songs by Henry Purcell who sang countertenor himself. Today there is a lot of interest again in using this type of voice for performing early music like Renaissance and Baroque music.

[[Breeches role]]

CATEGORIES: Cross-dressing, Opera terminology

A breeches role is a part in an opera in which a woman plays the role of a man. It is also called a trouser role (British) or pants role (U.S.) or travesti role (the Italian word). It is called a breeches role because breeches are tight-fitting, knee-length trousers. These used to be worn by men at the time that breeches roles became popular. Sometimes breeches roles are in plays, but they are usually in opera.

Breeches roles are usually female singers acting the role of a young man. They are normally sung by mezzo-sopranos or contraltos with light voices because they can often sound boyish. In the 17th and 18th centuries it was normal to have actors and actresses who cross-dressed. It was the time when castrato singers were popular. These castrati were men pretending to be women, but there were also women pretending to be men (especially when the actress was trying to deceive another character) and the audiences were used to this kind of thing. As they gradually stopped the horrible practice of castrating young boys in the late 18th century these male characters started to be sung by mezzo-sopranos instead.

Mozart wrote an opera called The Marriage of Figaro. In this opera the role of Cherubino, a young page boy, is sung by a mezzo-soprano. Other famous examples include the role of Siebel in Dvořák’s opera Rusalka and the role of Prince Orlofsky in Johann Strauss’s opera Die Fledermaus.

Composers from the 20th century do not usually have breeches roles in their operas. There is the role of Oktavian in Richard Strauss’s opera Der Rosenkavalier (1911), but this opera was deliberately trying to produce the old-fashioned atmosphere of Mozart’s time. Benjamin Britten wrote an opera called Midsummer Night’s Dream, based on Shakespeare’s play. There is no breeches role here. Instead, the part of Oberon is written for a countertenor: a man with a high, falsetto voice.

There is also a term called a skirt role. This is the opposite of a trouser role: it is a man acting the part of a woman. Benjamin Britten uses one in the role of the Madwoman in Curlew River. The witch in Humperdinck’s Hansel and Gretel is also sung by a man. In both cases it makes the characters more dramatic, but the first is very serious while the second is supposed to be humorous.

[[Treble (singer)]]

CATEGORIES: Vocal ranges

The word treble is used, especially in British English, to mean the singing voice of a boy or girl.  Often it is called boy soprano, but since there are also many girls who sing in cathedral and church choirs these days, the word treble is now used to describe the voice of either sex.

A boy can sing treble until he reaches puberty.  At puberty he starts to become a man and his voice range will go down (we say that his voice “breaks”).  He will then become a tenor, baritone or bass, or he may even train to be a countertenor.  A girl’s voice also changes when she reaches puberty, but the change into a grown-up female voice is more gradual than with a boy, and it is still within the soprano or  alto range.

Boys who join a cathedral choir or the choir of a large church will have to work hard to develop their voice and learn to sing musically.  They often start this training aged 7 or 8, and they may only have four or five years before their voice starts to break.  They do not usually become famous as soloists, but the Welsh treble Aled Jones became very famous for about three years and made many recordings before his voice broke in 1987.

The word ‘treble’ is used for children singing in a Classical Music style, especially church music.  Although children do not usually sing in opera, occasionally a treble is used for the part of a very small boy, e.g. in  Debussy’s opera Pélléas et Mélisande.

[[Claque]]

CATEGORIES: Opera terminology

A claque (pronounce: ‘clack’) is a small group of people in an opera house who deliberately either clapped loudly (applauded) or shouted boo for a particular singer. Usually it means an organised group who know in advance what they are going to do.

In the 19th century there was very often a claque at performances of an opera. Someone who liked one of the singers and wanted them to have lots of applause would pay a group of people to sit near the back of the opera house and to clap and shout enthusiastically whenever that singer had finished a song. This would encourage the rest of the audience to clap loudly too. Sometimes the claque would be paid to do the opposite: they would be told to hiss and boo when the singer had sung.

Very often a singer would have to pay some money to the claque so that they would applaud him (or her). If the singer did not pay, the claque would hiss and boo. This was, of course, a nasty form of blackmail. In the early 20th century, when the world-famous tenor Enrico Caruso refused to pay the claque in Naples a bribe, they hissed during his singing of the great aria Una furtiva lagrima.

Groups of supporters at football ('soccer') matches do much the same thing without being paid. Abuse of match officials is also quite common. Abuse between rival groups of fans is also common. Clubs are required to keep away fans in different sections from home fans. 

[[Leech]]

CATEGORIES: Annelids

Leeches are annelids, a kind of worm (ground creature) that lives in wet places. All leeches are carnivorous, that is, they eat mainly meat, but some are also haemophagic; this means they drink the blood of other animals. They are sometimes helpful in medicine. They are often used to reduce blood clots. They were used to suck the blood of patients a long time ago, before we knew about germs and that losing blood is bad for health.

[[Chemotherapy]]

CATEGORIES: Cancer treatment

Chemotherapy, or 'chemo', is the use of chemical substances to treat diseases. The word "chemotherapy" is often used for a type of medicine used to treat cancer. The drugs are cytotoxic, which means they are toxic to the body's cells.

There are many types of chemotherapy. and doctors chose the medication that will treat each types of cancer in the best way. Often, chemotherapy drugs are combined with each other and with other drugs when a person is treated for cancer.

When a person has surgery to remove a tumor, chemotherapy may be given before or after. 

Chemotherapy can also be used to treat other diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis.

[[Transylvania]]

CATEGORIES: Transylvania

Transylvania is a historical region in Central Europe. In the past, it was a part of Hungary, was an independent principality, belonged to the Ottoman Empire or was a province of Austria-Hungary.  It has been part of  Romania since 1918.

The borders was made up by the Siret River from east, river Tisza from west of north and south by the Carpathian Mountains. 

Transylvania's main city, Cluj-Napoca, is seen as the region's informal capital. But Transylvania was also ruled from Alba Iulia during its dependence from the Ottoman Empire, and the seat of the Transylvanian Diet was moved to Sibiu for some time in the 19th century.

In popular culture, Transylvania is mainly known as the seat (and origin) of Count Dracula. This vampire story by Bram Stoker is based on a local nobleman Vlad III the Impaler, known for his cruelty. It also was the home of Elizabeth Báthory.

Southwest Airlines is a airline based in Dallas, Texas that has a reputation for low fares. The airline started in 1971. It flies mostly among about a hundred airports within the United States but also to flies from the United States to airports in the Caribbean Sea and Mexico. 

Originally, many of Southwest's flights were to airports in the Southwestern United States, such as Dallas Love Field and Houston Hobby Airport, but it also flies to airports in other parts of the country, such as Chicago Midway Airport and Baltimore/Washington International Airport.  Southwest Airlines controls most of the gates at Dallas Love Field and most other airlines cannot fly from there.

In 2014, it started international flights. 

The company flies about 700 Boeing 737 aircraft. This is more than any other airline. It only flies the Boeing 737. By 2019, 13 were the newest kind, the Boeing 737 MAX.

Southwest Airlines bought the smaller AirTran Airways in 2010 and discontinued the AirTran name. For several years, Southwest was the largest airline in the United States based on number of passengers, but it was not the largest based on distance traveled. 

In 2018, an engine exploded on a Southwest Airlines flight, killing one passenger. That was the first death of a passenger from an aircraft accident on Southwest (earlier passenger deaths were from other causes, such as heart attack and drug overdoses).November 2019

[[Graphic design]]

CATEGORIES: Written communication, Graphics, Typography, History of printing

Graphic design is a practical art which helps in communication. Visual information is formed in a way that produces a message.  This can be done by placing words and pictures in ways that will get the attention of others.  People who do graphic design as work are called graphic designers.  In printed media, graphic design includes typography, organising illustration, book design, page layout, specifying print.

Graphic design can be done in different media.  These include paper, video, labels, and web sites. 

Graphic designers use many skills, rules and techniques to provide the right information.  They must combine artistic expression and media relations.  Skills include the ability to look at the whole picture, color theory, design principles, understanding of art, etc.

Graphic design today is heavily used in all types of media, magazine articles, internet and especially in advertising. Almost every marketing effort utilizes graphic design for brochures, business cards, websites, logo design and corporate identity. 

Contemporary graphic designs tends to feature modern geometric forms and shapes and bold typefaces. They emphasize making the message easy to read and comprehend and also grab attention and make memorable.

The Rwandan genocide happened in 1994.  It started in April and lasted 100 days. During that time, about 800,000 people were murdered.

In a genocide, many or all people in a group are killed because of their ethnicity, colour, religion, or political opinions.  In the Rwandan genocide, members of an ethnic group called the Tutsi (abatutsi) were killed because of their ethnicity.  The killers were extremist members of another ethnic group called the Hutu (abahutu).  The Hutu killers also killed other Hutus whose political beliefs were not as extreme as theirs.

Vaquita (Phocoena sinus) is a rare type of porpoise. It lives only in the Gulf of California.

[[Zygote]]

CATEGORIES: Biological reproduction

A zygote is the fertilized cell that will grow into a new animal or plant. When a female's ovum and a male's sperm cell join, the cell that results is called the zygote. The zygote then multiplies, and grows into an embryo. So, a zygote is formed from the union of two gametes, and is the first stage in a human organism's development. Zygotes are produced by fertilization between two haploid cells, the ovum and the sperm cells, which make a diploid cell. Diploid cells have copies of both parents' chromosomes and DNA. At conception it has all the necessary properties to create a fully formed human being. Life until death is a series of many different stages of development.  

Some animals keep the zygote in their bodies until it is a full-grown baby. The time between the forming of the zygote and the baby's birth is called pregnancy. Other animals do not keep the zygote in their bodies, but lay an egg. The zygote grows inside the egg until it is ready and a larva or baby animal hatches.

[[Cardiac arrest]]

CATEGORIES: Heart

Cardiac arrest happens when the heart suddenly stops beating.  This can be caused by a heart attack in which the heart's demand for oxygen is not met and the heart muscle begins to die. With cardiac arrest, normal circulation of blood stops, because of a failure of the heart to contract. This results in the body not getting enough oxygenated blood, which  causes cells to start to die from oxygen starvation. Cerebral hypoxia (lack of oxygen to the brain) makes a person lose consciousness and stop breathing, and this makes the heart stop completely. Unless the person is in hypothermia, brain damage usually occurs after three to five minutes. (In some cases, the person is put into hypothermia on purpose, to help the person recover better with less damage.)

Cardiac arrest is a medical emergency. If it is treated early enough, some of the damage done can be reversed in certain groups of patients. When cardiac arrest leads to a person's death, this is called sudden cardiac death (SCD). First aid treatment for cardiac arrest usually begins with cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to keep oxygenated blood flowing until medical treatment is available.

[[Combustion]]

CATEGORIES: Chemical processes

Combustion is a reaction of a fuel with an oxidant to give out heat. The release of heat can produce light in the form of a flame.

Car engines and rocket engines both work by combustion. Combustion in a Ferrari car motor is different from combustion in a rocket engine. Car combustion is gas burning and exploding in cylinders called pistons again and again to push them up and down, making the car move. Rocket combustion is made by rocket fuel exploding out of the back of the rocket moving it up. The burning of most substances is bad for the environment and the ozone layer because it can let off greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide. Hydrogen burns cleanly and gives off a lot of heat, but it does not produce much power, and is highly explosive.

During combustion, fuel reacts with oxygen and heat, then releases energy. Complete combustion happens in a plentiful supply of oxygen. Complete combustion releases more energy than incomplete combustion. Incomplete combustion occurs when the supply of air is limited, or poor. Incomplete combustion also creates carbon monoxide, and more soot. Several factors must be considered when choosing the best fuel for a particular purpose. Fuels are substances that react with oxygen to release useful energy. Most of the energy is released as heat, but light energy is also released. About 21 per cent of the air is oxygen. When a fuel burns in plenty of air, it receives enough oxygen for complete combustion. Complete combustion needs a plentiful supply of air so that the elements in the fuel react fully with oxygen. Fuels such as natural gas and petrol contain hydrocarbons. These are compounds of hydrogen and carbon only. Combustion is a high-temperature oxidation reaction.

[[Nanometre]]

CATEGORIES: Units of length

The nanometre (symbol: nm) is a unit used to measure length in the metric system. It is equal to one billionth of a metre (1 m / 1,000,000,000). The name combines the SI prefix nano- (from the Ancient Greek νάνος, nanos, "dwarf") with the parent unit name metre (from Greek μέτρον, metrοn, "unit of measurement"). It can be written in scientific notation as 1×10−9 m.

The nanometre is often used to express very tiny dimensions, such as measuring atoms. The nanometre is also commonly used to measure the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation near the part of the spectrum that can be seen by humans. Visible light ranges from around 400 to 800 nm.

The nanometre was formerly called the millimicrometre (or the millimicron). This is because it is 1/1000 of a micrometre, and was written with the symbol mµ (or sometimes µµ).

[[Caterpillar]]

CATEGORIES: Lepidoptera

A caterpillar is a young butterfly or moth that has just hatched out of its egg. A caterpillar is a kind of larva. When it is older, the caterpillar will turn into a pupa (also known as a chrysalis), and then later the pupa will turn into a butterfly.

Caterpillars usually have three pairs of small, but noticeable, true legs at the front and up to 5 pairs of fleshy false legs at the back.

Caterpillars are commonly found feeding on leaves, but they are also found inside living stems and branches or on the roots of plants and dead wood.

Most caterpillars are shades of green or brown and are relatively hairless, although in many families caterpillars are very hairy and often brightly coloured. Some species are pests of growing plants, carpets, woollens, organic fabrics and stored food products.

Caterpillars are an important source of food for birds and other invertebrates and many species help dead animals and plants decompose.

[[Hummingbird]]

CATEGORIES: Hummingbirds

Hummingbirds are small birds of the family Trochilidae.

They are among the smallest of birds: most species measure 7.5–13 cm (3–5 in). The smallest living bird species is the 2–5 cm Bee Hummingbird. They can hover in mid-air by rapidly flapping their wings 12–80 times per second (depending on the species). They are also the only group of birds able to fly backwards. Their rapid wing beats do actually hum. They can fly at speeds over 15 m/s (54 km/h, 34 mi/h).

Idi Amin Dada (circa 1925 – 16 August 2003) was a repressive dictator of the African country of Uganda. The President of Tanzania at the time, Julius Nyerere, invaded Uganda to save the country from Amin.

Amin was famous for sending all Asians, mainly from India and Pakistan, out of Uganda. He threw them out because he believed they were taking the jobs of Ugandans. Many of the Asians that left Uganda came back after Amin was thrown out.

He was a convert to Islam. He supported the cause of Palestine freedom. This caused the hijacking of an Air France flight that landed in Entebbe, Uganda.

Amin became known as a very brutal leader and in the 1970s he was compared to historical persons such as Caligula, Hitler, Beria and Himmler. In several of the neighboring countries he was stamped as "sadist, murderer, fascist and oppressor."

In 2003, Amin died in Jeddah , Saudi Arabia from kidney failure at age 77. He lived in Saudi Arabia after being thrown out of Uganda, he was barred from ever returning since he left. He died one day before his 78th birthday.

He was put on life support on July 18, but when his organs began to fail, life support mechanism was disconnected by his family. He was buried without any memorial in a simple grave without headstone.

The Last King of Scotland (2006) is a movie about Amin's government. Forest Whitaker won an Academy Award for best actor.

[[Take Me Out to the Ball Game]]

CATEGORIES: Baseball, 20th century songs

"Take Me Out to the Ball Game" is a 1908 Tin Pan Alley song. The words were written by Jack Norworth. The music was written by Albert Von Tilzer. Neither of the writers had been to a baseball game. The song has become the unofficial anthem of baseball. 

The chorus is traditionally sung during the seventh-inning stretch of a baseball game. Fans are generally encouraged to sing along. At some ballparks, the words "home team" are replaced with the team name, as is the case with the Houston Astros, San Francisco Giants, Pittsburgh Pirates, Boston Red Sox, Chicago Cubs, Chicago White Sox, Milwaukee Brewers, Philadelphia Phillies, Toronto Blue Jays, Miami Marlins, Colorado Rockies, Detroit Tigers and several other Major League Baseball teams.

The first recorded version of the song was made by Edward Meeker.  Meeker's recording was selected by the Library of Congress as a 2010 addition to the National Recording Registry. The Registry picks recordings once a year that are "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".

[[Xia dynasty]]

CATEGORIES: Chinese dynasties

Xia dynasty (Chinese: 夏朝; Pinyin: xià cháo; Wade–Giles: Hsia-ch'ao) was the first dynasty of China. It was founded in 2100 BC and ended in 1600 BC. Until archaeologists dug at Erlitou in Henan Province, many scientists were not sure if the Xia Dynasty was real or a myth. The last king was Jie who was said to be cruel and greedy. He was defeated by T'ang, the king of the Shang people from the east.

South Park is an American adult animated sitcom about the lives of four boys in the fourth grade living in the small mountain town of South Park, Colorado. The series is made to be watched by adults, but the series gets a lot of people to watch it because of its humor. It uses satire to make fun of subjects such as current events, religion, politics, and pop culture. The show is controversial because of its use of profanity and sexual humor. Creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone also made a movie based on this series called South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut. Characters in South Park include Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, Eric Cartman and Kenny McCormick. These boys are 10 years old. The series is about them living in their town.

[[Battle of Ðiện Biên Phủ]]

CATEGORIES: 1954, 20th century in Vietnam, Battles

The battle of Ðiện Biên Phủ happened in 1954. It was a battle between Vietnamese and French forces, which Vietnam won. This led the French to give up in the First Indochina War, securing the independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for the time. This was followed by the division of Vietnam into North and South and then the Second Indochinese War.

With the launch of Operation Castor, French soldiers were dropped from the Red River Delta by air, deep into the northwestern hills of Vietnam - Việt Minh territory.  They subsequently established a well-fortified garrison at Ðiện Biên Phủ, alongside an airstrip to supply their troops.  This was an attempt to lure the Vietnamese guerrilla fighters, commanded by General Võ Nguyên Giáp, into an all-out firefight to inflict devastating losses using their heavy artillery and superior firepower. 

However, the Việt Minh did not take the bait, and instead brought Chinese-funded heavy artillery into this difficult area, much to the French's surprise.  They also used their superior numbers in human-wave tactics to overwhelm the French (which was later abandoned).  Later, they dug deep trenches and used their artillery to shoot down any French air planes, destroy their airstrip and bombard the French troops into submission.  The French at Ðiện Biên Phủ surrendered in May 1954, after two months of fighting.  The French number of soldiers at the garrison had increased from 12,000 to over 15,000.  After years of fighting and this defeat, France did not want to continue fighting.

This was the first time an Asian colonial army defeated the army of a European power by military might. It was considered a surprise disaster for the French and a blow to the Western world. The French no longer wanted to maintain French Indochina, and negotiated and withdrew from Indochina. French colonies in Africa also revolted and by 1967 most of the French colonial empire was gone.

[[August Revolution]]

The August Revolution happened in Vietnam in August 1945.  It was an uprising for independence after the Japanese lost World War II.  It led to the Declaration of Independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on September 2, 1945.  The independence war against the French would soon follow.

[[Dictator]]

CATEGORIES: Politics

The word dictator or despot in modern times is used to describe the absolute ruler (other than a king) of a country, who uses force and fear to keep himself and his friends in authority, and can effectively make laws all by himself. Dictatorship is a type of government, used in some countries. A country that is ruled by a dictator is called a dictatorship. Dictatorship is often called a cruel government, because it is considered most violent.  

The word "dictator" is from the Roman Republic where a man would be given absolute power for half a year or one year to handle an emergency. Julius Caesar was the last Roman Dictator. 

Some dictators gained political power in a revolution. Some won an election and cancelled new elections once they took power.

It is not always clear whether a leader is a dictator or not. Some leaders got into power by elections, but sometimes they gave false election results.

Kings and emperors often use force and fear too, but usually they are not called dictators.  This is because those monarchs have some reason for being in power (usually their father was king or emperor), but a dictator gained power himself. Also, when someone is king or emperor of a country, usually there were several kings or emperors before them. A dictator often creates the job of dictator by gaining power.

Some people call leaders dictators because they simply do not like them and they seem powerful.

[[Khmer language]]

CATEGORIES: Austro-Asiatic languages, Cambodia

Khmer is the official language of Kampuchea/Cambodia. Its script was the base for the Thai script, although Thai does not use subscript consonants. One thing that makes it particularly difficult for many foreigners to learn is that Khmer words are not separated in a sentence and the sounds are quite hard for foreigners to replicate. But still each word in the sentence can be distinguished. Also, there is not much material on Khmer, although this situation is changing.

[[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]

CATEGORIES: Democratic Republic of the Congo, French-speaking countries, Least developed countries, 1960 establishments in Africa

The Democratic Republic of the Congo (République démocratique du Congo), commonly referred to as DR Congo, Congo-Kinshasa or the DRC, is a country in central Africa.  It was known as Zaïre from 1971 to 1997.  It is the second largest country in Africa by area and the eleventh largest in the world.  With a population of over 71 million, the Democratic Republic of the Congo is the nineteenth most populous nation in the world, the fourth most populous nation in Africa, as well as the most populous Francophone (French-speaking) country.

DRC borders the Central African Republic and South Sudan to the north; Uganda, Rwanda, and Burundi in the east; Zambia and Angola to the south; the Republic of the Congo, the Angolan exclave of Cabinda, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. It is separated from Tanzania by Lake Tanganyika in the east. The country has access to the ocean through a 40 stretch of Atlantic coastline at Muanda and the roughly 9 km wide mouth of the Congo River which opens into the Gulf of Guinea. It has the second-highest total Christian population in Africa.

[[Spotted hyena]]

CATEGORIES: Mammals of Africa, Hyaenas

The spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta) is a species of hyena (or "hyaena" in British English). They are often called the laughing hyena. They are found almost everywhere in Sub-Saharan Africa. There are between 27,000 and 47,000 individuals, though their population is getting smaller in the wild. This is because of habitat loss and illegal hunting. They lived in Europe for at least a million years until the end of the Pleistocene.

The spotted hyena is the largest member of the Hyaenidae. They are the most social Carnivora animals, with various group sizes. Hyenas are pack hunters. Their behaviors are still not well understand. However, their social system is not cooperative but competitive. Females take care of their own cubs only, and males are not interested in helping females with their cubs. Females are larger than males and they can control them. The females are the only mammalian species not to have a vaginal opening.

The spotted hyena is a successful scavenger as well as hunter They can eat skin, bone and other animal waste. Spotted hyenas hunt with a family group of about two to five other hyenas. The family lives in large communities (called "clans") which may have up to 80 individuals.

They  run around herds of animals and choose one to attack. After they have selected their prey, they  chase them for a long time. They can run at speeds up to 60 km/h. Humans have known spotted hyenas for a long time. In the Upper Paleolithic, humans made paintings of hyenas in caves. Spotted hyenas have a negative reputation in Western culture and African folklore. In African folklore, spotted hyenas are described as ugly and scared animals. In Western culture, they are seen as greedy, stupid, foolish, powerful and a dangerous animal.

[[Aardwolf]]

CATEGORIES: Hyaenas

The aardwolf (Proteles cristata) is a small, insectivorous mammal, native to East Africa and Southern Africa. Its name means "earth wolf" in the Afrikaans / Dutch language. It is also called "maanhaar jackal" in Afrikaans, or civet hyena, based on the secretions (civet) from their anal glands.

The aardwolf is in the same family as the hyenas. Unlike many of its relatives in the order Carnivora, the aardwolf does not hunt large animals, or even eat meat on a regular basis; instead it eats insects, mainly termites – one aardwolf can eat about 250,000 termites during a single night by using its long, sticky tongue to capture them.

The aardwolf lives in the scrublands of eastern and southern Africa – these are open lands covered with stunted trees and shrubs. The aardwolf is nocturnal, resting in burrows during the day and coming out at night to eat.

Anal gland scent-marking plays an important role in mating-season in both sexes as it is the primarily communication method.

Blue cheese is a type of cheese with a fungus called Penicillium added to it. The mold makes patches or veins of it look blue. The cheese can be made from cow's milk, sheep's milk, or goat's milk. Types of it include Roquefort cheese, Stilton cheese, and Gorgonzola cheese. These names should only be used for cheeses that are made in certain areas and are protected by the European Union.

[[Elektra]]

CATEGORIES: People in Greek mythology

Elektra of Mycenae was the daughter of King Agamemnon of Mycenae and Klytaimnestra. She had a brother, Orestes, and two sisters, Iphigeneia and Chrysothemis.

After the Trojan War, Agamemnon was killed by Klytaimnestra and her lover Aegisthos because Agamemnon sacrificed Iphigeneia for good winds to sail. Elektra helped Orestes to kill their mother Klytaimnestra and her lover, to avenge their father's death.

[[Insulin]]

CATEGORIES: Biochemistry

Insulin is a hormone made by the pancreas in the body that controls the glucose level in the blood.

People who cannot make insulin in their bodies, or who make it but their body cannot use it properly, have the disease diabetes. When blood glucose levels fall below a certain level, the human body begins to use stored sugar as an energy source through glycogenolysis. This process breaks down the glycogen stored in the liver and muscles into glucose which can then be used as an energy source. Insulin is a central metabolic control mechanism. Insulin is also used as a control signal to other body systems (such as amino acid uptake by body cells). In addition, it has several other anabolic effects throughout the body. Insulin affects vascular compliance and cognition.

Human insulin is a peptide hormone composed of 51 amino acids and has a molecular weight of 5808 Da. The islets of Langerhans in the pancreas produces insulin. The name comes from the Latin insula for "island". Insulin's structure varies slightly between species of animals. Insulin from different animal sources has different effects on the human carbohydrate metabolism process. Porcine insulin is especially close to the human version. So, people with diabetes can take in insulin extracted from pigs instead of producing their own insulin.

[[Dragon Ball Z]]

CATEGORIES: Anime series based on manga

Dragon Ball Z is a Japanese anime television series produced by Toei Animation. It is the sequel to Dragon Ball  and adapts the latter 325 chapters of the original 519-chapter Dragon Ball manga series created by Akira Toriyama which ran in Weekly Shōnen Jump from 1984 to 1995. Dragon Ball Z aired in Japan on Fuji TV from April 1989 to January 1996, before getting subtitled or dubbed in territories including the United States, Canada, Australia, Europe, Asia, India and Latin America. It was broadcast in at least 81Spacescountries worldwide. It is part of the Dragon Ball media franchise.

Dragon Ball Z continues the adventures of Son Goku, who, along with his companions, defends the Earth against villains ranging from aliens (Vegeta, Frieza), androids (Cell) and magical creatures (Majin Buu). While the original Dragon Ball anime followed Goku from childhood to early adulthood, Dragon Ball Z is a continuation of his adult life, but at the same time parallels the life of his son, Gohan, as well as the development of his rivals, Piccolo and Vegeta.

Due to the success of the anime in the United States, the manga chapters making up its story were initially released by Viz Media under the Dragon Ball Z title.

Dragon Ball Z is adapted from the final 324 chapters of the manga series which were published in Weekly Shōnen Jump from 1988 to 1995. It premiered in Japan on Fuji Television on April 26, 1989, taking over its predecessor's time slot, and ran for 291 episodes until its conclusion on January 31, 1996.

Throughout the production, the voice actors were tasked with playing different characters and performing their lines on cue, switching between roles as necessary.

The voice actors were unable to record the lines separately because of the close dialogue timing. When asked if juggling the different voices of Goku, Gohan and Goten were difficult, Masako Nozawa said that it was not and that she was able to switch roles simply upon seeing the character's picture. She did admit that when they were producing two films a year and television specials in addition to the regular series, there were times when they had only line art to look at while recording, which made giving finer nuanced details in her performance difficult.

[[Nerve impulse]]

CATEGORIES: Physiology

A nerve impulse is the way nerve cells (neurons) communicate with one another. Nerve impulses are mostly electrical signals along the dendrites to produce a nerve impulse or action potential. 

The action potential is the result of ions moving in and out of the cell. Specifically, it involves potassium (K+) and sodium (Na+) ions. The ions are moved in and out of the cell by potassium channels, sodium channels and the sodium-potassium pump.

CATEGORIES: Lagomorphs

A hare is a mammal of the order Lagomorpha, in the same family as the rabbit. They are larger than rabbits and have black tipped ears. Their diet (the food they eat) resembles what rabbits eat; they eat ruttabaga and lettuce. They graze on grass and leafy weeds.

Hares are very fast-running animals. The European brown hare (Lepus europaeus) runs at speeds up to 35. The five species of jackrabbit found in central and western North America can run at 40, and can leap up to 3m (ten feet) at a time. They live solitarily or in pairs; a "drove" is the name for a group of hares.

[[Computer bus]]

CATEGORIES: Computer buses

A computer bus (often simply called bus) is part of most computers. Its role is to transfer data, signals, or power between some of the components that make up a computer. 

The size or width of a bus is how many bits it carries in parallel. Common bus sizes are: 4 bits, 8 bits, 12 bits, 16 bits, 24 bits, 32 bits, 64 bits, 80 bits, 96 bits, and 128 bits. Computers use such buses to link:

Drives are usually connected by Serial ATA or the earlier ATAPI bus. USB and Firewire connections go to printers and other peripheral devices.

[[Diego Ramírez Islands]]

CATEGORIES: Islands of Chile

The Diego Ramírez Islands are a group of islands. They are in the Drake Passage, about 100 km southwest of Cape Horn. The Ildefonso Islands are 93 km to the north-northwest. There is a group of 6 islands to the north, then there is a waterway of 3 km, then there is another group to the south. There is a weather station in one of the islands. The islands are an important nesting place for birds.

The islands belong to Chile, and are named after Diego Ramírez. They were first sighted on 12 February 1619 by Marco Ramirez of the Garcia de Nodal expedition, and named after the cosmographer of the expedition. They were the southernmost landmass known at the time. They kept this status for 156 years. In 1775, James Cook discovered the South Sandwich Islands, which are much farther south.

The Chilean Navy built a meteorological station above Caleta Condell, a small cove on the northeast side of Isla Gonzalo (Gonzalo Island), in 1957, and resupply it several times each year. This is the southernmost manned outpost of South America (including islands), even if the South Sandwich Islands are regarded as part of South America. The Argentinian station on Thule Island was taken down in June 1982  after the Falklands War. The next southerly manned outpost of South America is the lighthouse of Cape Horn. Cruise ships sometimes pass by on their way to and from Antarctica.

The archipelago has 2 groups. The North group is smaller and is named as Rocas del Norte. There are 5 islands in this group, Islote Cabezas, Islote Peñailillo, Isla Norte, Islote Martínez and Islote Mendoza. In the South group are many islands, for example; Islote Santander, Islotes Vergara, Isla Bartolomé (the principal island), Islote Pontevedra, Islote García, Isla Gonzalo (the second longest) and Islote Ester.

All the islands have moss on the ground, and they have a cold climate all year, with much rain every month. Because of how far south they are, there is a strong wind from the west.

[[Performing music from memory]]

CATEGORIES: Musical performance techniques

Performing music from memory means knowing a piece of music well enough to be able to play or sing it without the written music.    

Although some people can learn music by ear, most people who are taught to play musical instruments learn new pieces by reading the printed music which is in front of them on a music stand.  When someone has learned to play a piece of music well enough to perform it, it is good if they can learn to play it without the printed music.  This is called “playing from memory” or “playing by heart”.  When a musician is practising a piece of music so that it can be played from memory this is called memorizing the music.

Most Classical musicians will agree that it is good to play from memory when performing as a soloist.  It means that the player understands the music really well, and he is able to concentrate completely on the way he plays the music (the interpretation).  In some music competitions the competitors are expected to play from memory.  A pianist playing a recital will usually play everything from memory.  It is particularly important for singers who are performing songs (Lieder) to sing without music because they can then communicate directly with the audience using the expression on their faces.  Some conductors conduct from memory.  If they do, they ought to know every single note for every single instrument from memory. There are some conductors who have such amazing memories that they can do this.

Some people find it easier to memorize music than others.  There are different ways of practising to help memorize music: by memorizing a few bars at a time, by studying the printed music away from the instrument, or by “thinking” through the piece away from the instrument.

Some people have a “photographic memory” and can see in their mind the music as printed on the paper.  Some people rely on aural memory (hearing it in one’s imagination).  There is also muscular memory (the fingers "knowing" what to do).  Probably most people use some combination of all these methods.

When people perform from memory they are often worried that they might have a memory lapse (forget how the music goes).  It can happen, of course, even to the greatest musicians.  The famous violinist Bronislaw Huberman and the pianist  Eugen d’Albert were once performing Beethoven’s Kreutzer Sonata.  Both were playing from memory.  One of them kept going wrong in the same place, playing something that had happened earlier, so that they played the middle bit three times before eventually managing to finish the piece.  However, this is quite common, and can happen to anyone. 

People who learn musical instruments should try to memorize some of their pieces. Many famous musicians have a large repertoire (a collection) of pieces that they can play from memory.

[[Grave]]

CATEGORIES: Death customs, Burial monuments and structures

A grave, or burial spot is where somebody or something is buried after they have died. Graves are usually placed in a graveyard, with a headstone used to identify the dead person. A funeral will occur if the family has enough money. If they do not, there will not be a proper funeral. The name on the grave is of the dead person. For example, William Shakespeare was buried in England.

[[Polyrhythm]]

CATEGORIES: Musical terminology

Polyrhythm happens when two different rhythms are played at the same time in music. African, Latin, and Afro-Cuban music often use polyrhythms.

Polyrythm is another word for layering and adding volumes to the piece of music. It happens when one person starts playing a rhythm and then other people start joining in, adding dynamics to it. It happens in Africa during festivals and occasions along with a call and response style of playing.

[[Twin prime conjecture]]

CATEGORIES: Number theory, Conjectures

The twin prime conjecture is a mathematical theory. It says that it is possible to find two twin primes that are as big as wanted.

Twin primes are prime numbers that differ by two. For example, 3 and 5 are both prime and differ by two. They are twin primes. 23 is prime, but it is not a twin prime. The primes nearest to 23 are 19 and 29. Twin primes were discovered by Euclid in 300 B.C.

Since Euclid's time mathematicians have wondered whether there are an infinite number of twin primes. Many mathematicians are still trying to find the answer.

[[Mud]]

CATEGORIES: Soil, Sedimentary rocks

Mud is a mixture of soil, silt, loam or clay, mixed with and water. It is a type of soil that is also called "clay soil".  Others include the sandy soil, or sand, and garden soil.  Wet mud has a soft wet texture. 

Young children sometimes play in puddles of mud.  Mud is usually brown.  

Some animals including worms, frogs, snails, clams, and crayfish live in mud.  Pigs and elephants use it to cool themselves in hot weather.  Some people enjoy making mud pies out of mud. 

Great river systems like the Amazon bring down to the delta immense amounts of mud which ends up in the sea outside the fan of the river mouth. Mudrock is what the mud may become millions of years later. Mudrocks make up fifty percent of the sedimentary rocks in the geologic record, and are easily the most widespread deposits on Earth.

[[Dwarf planet]]

CATEGORIES: Dwarf planets, Solar System

Dwarf planet is the name used to classify some objects in the solar system. This definition was made on August 24, 2006 by the International Astronomical Union (IAU), and can be described as; a dwarf planet is a body orbiting the Sun that is big enough to round itself by its own gravity, but has not cleared its orbital path of other rival bodies. At the same meeting the IAU also defined the term planet for the first time. Some astronomers think that the term "dwarf planet" is too confusing and needs to be changed.

The seven dwarf planets, in order from their distance from the Sun are:

The dwarf planets, unlike the terrestrial and gas giant planets, are in more than one region of the solar system. Ceres is in the asteroid belt. The high orbital eccentricity of Pluto puts it mostly outside Neptune's orbit, but partly inside. The others are in the trans-Neptune region.

NASA's Dawn and New Horizons missions reached Ceres and Pluto, respectively, in 2015. Dawn had already orbited and observed Vesta in 2011.

There are many other dwarf planets in the solar system. Most of them are also Kuiper belt objects.

[[Nintendo Virtual Boy]]

CATEGORIES: Nintendo video game consoles, Handheld video games

The Nintendo Virtual Boy was a mostly-portable (easily moved) game console which had two screens that showed only red and black graphics. To use the system, one had to put one's face close to the system so that each eye could see only one screen. By showing each eye a different image, the system could create a 3D effect.

The way the system displayed images was not by LCDs, as some would think. At the time, LCDs could not be used because they had two problems when they were first tested on the console: they would blur if anything moved on the screen, and users would see double instead of depth. Instead, a vertical line of 224 very bright, but very small, LEDs were used for each eye. These LEDs flashed on and off very fast in certain patterns. This line of LEDs was then magnified by a lens, and a vibrating mirror would reflect each line at a certain time into each eye, creating a full image due to the human eye's persistence of vision. Unfortunately, due to the quick flashing of the LEDs, many users felt sick, became dizzy, or had headaches after playing for a long time. To help this, an "automatic pause" feature was added, which stopped the game play every 30 minutes for the player to rest his or her eyes.

The Virtual Boy was first sold in 1995, but was not popular. Consumers did not like the console's high price, monochrome graphics, eye and neck strain, and need for a stand. Many were saving money for the soon-to-be-sold Nintendo 64. Nintendo lowered the price many times, but the system did not sell well and was discontinued (Nintendo stopped making them) in 1996. Only 22 games were released in Japan and North America. Virtual Boy sold 770,000 units.

Popular games for the system include Mario Tennis and Virtual Boy Wario Land (Known as Wario Cruise in Japan).

The Virtual Boy was made by Gunpei Yokoi, who also made the Game Boy and Game & Watch.

People rumored that Gunpai Yakoi made the Virtual Boy as a parting gift, but unfortunately it failed.

There was a Japan version of the Virtual Boy, (Family Computer 3-D System) it played in color and indeed, played in 3-D.

[[Existentialism]]

CATEGORIES: Philosophical movements and positions

Existentialism is a way of thinking that focuses on what it means for people to exist. It is a philosophical movement. It became well-known in books and movies of the 19th and 20th centuries. Existentialism is known for dealing with nihilistic problems, but is generally still a kind of Nihilism#Anti-nihilism. It says that humans have will and consciousness, but they live in a world that does not. The premise that people must make choices about their life while knowing they are mortal is what existentialism is all about.

It was started by the Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard (18131855).

Kierkegaard was a very religious man, but existentialism in the 20th century became more and more atheistic. Most of its main thinkers and writers were in mainland Europe. For example, Jean-Paul Sartre spent most of the Second World War in a German prison camp, reading the philosophy of Martin Heidegger. When he came out he gave a lecture called Existentialism and Humanism. This early lecture may be easier to read than his later work.

Many religions and philosophies (ways of thinking about the world) say that human life has a meaning (or a purpose). But people who believe in existentialism think that the world and human life have no meaning unless people give them meaning: ‘existence precedes before essence’. This means that we find ourselves existing in the world, and then we give ourselves meaning, or 'essence'. As Sartre said, "We are condemned to be free". This means that we have no choice but to choose, and that we have full responsibility for our choices. Another way to put it is that we are always making choices even if we don't realize it.

Existentialists believe that our human 'essence' or 'nature' (way of being in the world) is simply our 'existence' (being in the world). More simply put, the 'essence' of a human, or what makes a human a 'human', is not due to nature or uncontrollable circumstances; rather, human essence is really just what we choose to make it. This means that the only nature we as humans have is the nature we make for ourselves. As a result of this, existentialists think that the actions or choices that a person makes are very important. They believe that every person has to decide for themselves what is right and wrong, and what is good and bad.

People who believe in existentialism ask questions like ’what is it like to be a human (a person) in the world?’ and ’how can we understand human freedom (what it means for a person to be free)?’ Existentialism is often connected with negative emotions, such as anxiety (worrying), dread (a very strong fear), and mortality (awareness of our own death). Some existentialists, like Sartre and Heidegger, think that thinking about these emotions helps people to choose the way that they want to live their lives.

Existentialism is sometimes confused with nihilism.  It is different from nihilism, but there is a similarity. Nihilists believe that human life does not have a meaning (or a purpose) at all; existentialism says that people must choose their own purpose.

King of the Hill was an American animated cartoon that ran from 1997 to 2010 on FOX. It featured a husband, a wife, a son, and their live-in niece. FOX, the network running the series, would not be showing new episodes anymore after its 13th and final season. The final four episodes aired in May 2010.

[[Hairdresser]]

CATEGORIES: Personal service occupations, Hair

A hairdresser's job is to organise hair into a particular style or "look". They can cut hair, add colour to it or texture it. A hairdresser may be female or male. Qualified staff are usually called "stylists", who are supported by assistants. Most hairdressing businesses are unisex, that is, they serve both sexes, and have both sexes on their staff.

Male hairdressers who simply cut men's hair (and do not serve females) are often called barbers.

Qualifications for hairdressing usually mean a college course, or an apprenticeship under a senior stylist. Some aspects of the job are quite technical (such as hair dying) and require careful teaching.

Esther "Eppie" Pauline Friedman Lederer, better known as Ann Landers (July 4, 1918 – June 22, 2002), was an American writer. She is best known for writing the famous advice column "Ann Landers." For almost 45 years, it was a part of many newspapers across North America. In it, people wrote for advice and she answered.

Lederer and her twin sister Pauline Esther Friedman Phillips, writer of the advice column "Dear Abby", were daughters of Russian Jewish emigrants.

Northern bluefin tuna are the largest kind of tuna fish. They live for 11 to 26 years. It is one of the largest, fastest, and most colorful of all the world’s fishes.

[[Automaton]]

CATEGORIES: Mathematics, Theoretical computer science

An Automaton (one automaton, several automata) is a concept from mathematics. Sometimes the concept is called state machine. It is like an abstract machine. 

Such a machine can be given input, which is either rejected, or accepted. It's like a vending machine. When something is bought, coins (or money) needs to be inserted into the machine. If these are the right coins, they are accepted, and the requested item is dropped so it can be removed. If the coins are wrong, they are rejected.

Internally, the automaton has different states it can be in. Feeding it input may (or may not) change its state. That way, the automaton goes through all the input, consuming one item (which mathematicians call a symbol) at a time. When no symbol is left, the automaton is in a certain state. This may be an final state. In this case the input is accepted. Otherwise, the input is rejected.

If the machine has a countable, finite number of states, it is called finite state machine.  A diagram that shows all the states, and transitions of such a machine is called finite state diagram.

[[Vending machine]]

CATEGORIES: Commerce

A Vending machine is an automatic machine that sells food or drink or other items. Vending machine foods include snacks  such as potato chips, chocolate bars, and candy. Hot vending machine drinks include coffee, tea, and hot chocolate. Cold vending machine drinks include juice, bottled water, soft drinks. Other merchandise includes newspapers or cigarettes. Vending machines in bathrooms sometimes sell condoms, mouthwash, or toothpaste and toothbrushes. 

The machines usually work, when some money (usually coins or paper money) is put in a slot. Then, a button needs to be pushed, or a lever pulled. If there is enough money, the selected item will be dropped to a tray, where it can be taken out by the person making the purchase. Ticket vending machines will print the ticket. Older vending machines were all mechanical, but most newer ones are partly electronic.  Many modern vending machines can accept debit or credit cards in addition to cash.

[[Bar (business)]]

CATEGORIES: Restaurants, Places where alcohol is served

A bar is a building or business where alcoholic drinks (such as beer, wine, or liquor) are served. Bars are also found in pubs and nightclubs. They may also serve snack food. In most countries, bars are regulated and licenced by the regional or local governments, which establish laws regarding the opening hours and serving policies. In Canada and the United States, a liquor tax is placed on the sales of alcoholic beverages.

Drink coasters are used in bars and restaurants to protect the table surface from alcohol.

[[Cape Horn]]

CATEGORIES: Geography of Chile, Capes, Peninsulas

Cape Horn (Kaap Hoorn; Cabo de Hornos) is a cape. It was named for the city of Hoorn in the Netherlands. It is the southernmost land area of the Tierra del Fuego archipelago of southern Chile. Many people see Cape Horn as the southern tip of South America. Cape Horn is the most southerly of the great capes. The Drake Passage is directly to the south of it. For many years, it was a major milestone on the clipper route by which sailing ships carried trade around the world. The waters around the cape are very dangerous because of strong winds, large waves, and icebergs. These reasons have made it notorious as a sailors' graveyard.

Today, the Panama Canal has greatly reduced the need for cargo ships to travel via the Horn. However, sailing around the Horn is widely regarded as one of the major challenges in yachting, and a number of recreational sailors continue to sail this route, sometimes as part of a circumnavigation of the globe. Several prominent ocean yacht races, notably the Vendée Globe, sail around the world via the Horn, and speed records for round-the-world sailing follow the same route.

[[Iceberg]]

CATEGORIES: Water

An iceberg is a large piece of ice floating in the sea.  They are generally found in cold water near the North or South Pole. Icebergs are especially common during spring, when ice has begun to melt. About 90% of an iceberg is below the water line and ten percent above. Just by looking at the part you can see, it is hard to tell how the part underwater looks, and how close you can get before crashing into it.

Icebergs break off from larger structures made of ice, like glaciers or ice shelves. These are formed by snowfall in very cold places where it will not melt in the summer. The snow builds up and compacts into ice. This is gradually pulled downhill by gravity and into the sea. The ice then falls off and makes icebergs. The icebergs can drift in the sea for years before they have melted completely.

[[Circumnavigation]]

CATEGORIES: Water transport

Circumnavigation originally meant going around something, by ship. Usually, it means people going around the world. The first known circumnavigation was done by Fernão de Magalhães (Ferdinand Magellan), from 1519 to 1522. Magellan took five ships and went west, from Spain. He discovered a waterway which is now named after him, the Strait of Magellan. Magellan died in a fight with natives on the Philippine island Mactan in April 1521. The voyage was completed under command of Juan Sebastián Elcano. Elcano returned to Sanlúcar de Barrameda, where the voyage had started, with 18 survivors and valuable cargo in 1522. This proved that the earth was a globe.

[[Thought experiment]]

CATEGORIES: Science, Philosophy of science, Thought

A thought experiment is an experiment that takes place in the mind of a scientist. Unlike with a real-life experiment where change is actually seen and perhaps measured, thought experiments are done just to show a special way of thinking.  Anyone can do a thought experiment. All you need is your mind because all the steps take place in your mind.

The usual goal of a thought experiment is to explore the  consequences of the principle in question. Like so: if this were true, what would follow from it?

Thought experiments are notable in the history of science. Hans Christian Ørsted was the first to use the German term Gedankenexperiment (means 'thought experiment') about 1812. 

Posing hypothetical questions had been done for long time (by scientists and philosophers). However, people had no way of talking about it. 

[[Breaking Benjamin]]

Breaking Benjamin is a hard rock band from Pennsylvania.  The band is best known for their songs "Polyamorous", "So Cold", "Sooner or Later," "The Diary of Jane," and "Breath."  The band was formed in 1998 by lead vocalist Benjamin Burnley and drummer Jeremy Hummel. The band has released five albums: "Saturate"(2002), "We Are Not Alone"(2004), "Phobia"(2006), "Dear Agony"(2009), "Dark Before Dawn"(2015) and Ember (2018)

The band's album "Dark Before Dawn" was released on June 23rd, 2015.

This album has made 5 singles which are "Failure", "Angels Fall", "Ashes of Eden" "Defeated" and "Never Again"

[[Headlands and bays]]

CATEGORIES: Landforms, Bays

A headland is an area of land that is surrounded by water on three sides.  Very often, the land areas are called capes. A bay is an area of water. It is surrounded by land on three sides. The water areas are also called gulfs.  

A bay is a large body of water in the land next to a sea or lake between two headlands. The waves coming to the shore in a bay are usually constructive waves, and because of this, many of them have a beach. A bay may be metres across, or it could be hundreds of kilometres across.  A bay often contains beaches.

Bays form where weak rocks, such as sands and clays, are eroded, leaving bands of stronger rocks, such as chalk, limestone, or granite, forming a headland, or peninsula.  Headlands and bays are formed when there are parallel sections of softer and harder rock perpendicular to the coast. The sea erodes the softer rock faster than the harder rock, forming a bay. The harder rock that is left protruding into the sea is the headland.  

They also can be made by people mining off the coast. 

[[Drake Passage]]

CATEGORIES: Waterways, Antarctic region

The Drake passage is a body of water. It lies between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. To the north is Cape Horn and the South American continent, to the south are the South Shetland Islands, now part of the British Antarctic Territory. It is part of the Southern Ocean.  It is named after the English privateer Sir Francis Drake, who accidentally discovered it.  He never sailed the passage, because sailing the Strait of Magellan was less dangerous. 

The Drake passage is also the shortest route from Antarctica to the rest of the world. The only islands in the passage are the Diego Ramirez Islands, about 60 km south of Cape Horn. 

The passage is also known for very rough seas. Waves of 10 m are not uncommon here. 

The passage is also good for seeing Whales, Dolphins, seabirds, and penguins. 

In old books, the passage is called Drake Strait.

[[Glacier]]

CATEGORIES: Landforms

A glacier is a large body of ice and snow. It forms because the snow in an area does not all melt in summer. Each winter, more snow is added. The weight of all the snow creates pressure. This pressure turns the lower parts of the snow into ice. After this happens for many years, the glacier will start growing large. It becomes so heavy that gravity causes the ice to move. It flows downwards like water but very slowly. A glacier only moves about 50 per year. New snowfalls replace the parts that flow away.

Glaciers are the largest sources of fresh water on Earth. The largest bodies of salt water are the Oceans

[[Sight-reading]]

CATEGORIES: Musical performance techniques

Sight-reading (or sight-singing for singers) is the ability to play music that one has never seen before.  It is important to be able to read music well in order to sight-read.

Many people who learn to play an instrument will take examinations from time to time.  One of the tests that is usually required for an examination is some sight-reading.  

People who find it hard to read music will find it hard to sight-read.  The best way to improve is by regular practice. People who play in orchestras will need to be good sight-readers because they often have to play music that they have never seen or heard before.  

People who learn the piano often find sight-reading hard because they have to read two staves at once (one for each hand).  Playing through lots of easy music is a good way to improve.  Playing piano duets with a friend is also great fun. 

When someone is reading aloud their eyes are looking several words ahead of the word they are speaking.  In the same way a good sight-reader will try to look ahead of the notes he is playing.  The player is "anticipating" (thinking about what is going to happen next).  In this way he can try to make the music expressive, even if it means leaving out some of the notes.

A good sight-reader will be able to see the printed music and imagine what the notes should sound like.  In this way he will not need to keep looking at his fingers to check whether he is playing the correct notes.

Some pianists are very good at sight-reading.  The pianist John Ogdon was able to read extremely difficult modern music at first sight.

[[Child prodigy]]

CATEGORIES: Child prodigies, Intelligence

A child prodigy is a child who is very smart at an early age. They can do things that average people can only do when they are adults. Child prodigies are often musicians or mathematicians. A child prodigy does not always grow up to be a world-famous genius. Some of them lose their exceptional gifts in adulthood.

[[Puerto Rican]]

CATEGORIES: Puerto Rico

A Puerto Rican is a person from Puerto Rico or anyone who is descended from some one who was originally from Puerto Rico. Puerto Ricans are American citizens, even though Puerto Rico is only a territory of the United States and not an official state. People from Puerto Rico can also be known as a "Boricua," "Borinquen," "Puertoriqueño," or the most known slang of "Boricua."

The name of "Boricua," and "Borinqueños" came from the islands original name of Boriken, meaning Land of the Brave People. This name was created by the Taino-Arawak people, who were highly advanced. Taino-Arawak ancestors date back to 4,000 B.C.

[[Toothbrush]]

CATEGORIES: Tools, Teeth, Hygiene

The toothbrush is a tool to clean teeth. The toothbrush has a small brush at the end of a handle. Toothpaste, which often contains fluoride, is commonly added to a toothbrush to help clean the teeth. Both toothpaste and toothbrushes come in many different colours. Toothpastes can also come in many different flavours. Nice toothbrushes (especially electrical) can make toothbrushing fun and help your child on the way to perfect oral health.

[[Homeostasis]]

CATEGORIES: Physiology, Systems theory

Homeostasis  is self-regulation, a basic property of all self-organising systems. In biology, it is the keeping of a stable internal environment.

Homeostasis is life's ability to stay balanced, when the environment changes. Animals keep their body in a stable condition. They do so by regulating their inner equilibrium . For example, they adjust their pH, temperature, amount of oxygen or carbon dioxide in the blood and so on. In living things, the study of how they keep in a stable condition is called physiology. Mostly, our physiology works unconsciously throughout life. We have many negative feedback systems which adjust our physiology so that we stay alive. These systems are self-organising and do not need to be learnt. They are inherited.

The concept was described by Claude Bernard, and the term was later coined by Walter Cannon in 1926, 1929, and 1932. Walter Cannon thought these were the features of homeostasis:

Examples of homeostasis:

In mammals, the main organs involved with homeostasis are:

The brain is also central to homeostasis. It controls behaviour, and the basic function of behaviour is to support life by taking action.

[[Pulmonary embolism]]

CATEGORIES: Pulmonology

A pulmonary embolism is a clot of material (an embolus) that blocks blood from getting to the lungs.  It is usually caused by a blood clot that starts somewhere else in the body and travels to the lungs.  However, it can also be caused by clumped cancer cells, fat, or bone.  Rarely, while giving birth, a woman can get a clot of amniotic fluid.

[[Toilet]]

CATEGORIES: Home, Waste management

A toilet is a place where humans get rid of waste that comes from their bodies (urine and feces). Most toilets use water and to flush the waste through plumbing into a sewage system. However, some modern toilets do not use water, and are called dry toilets.

A room that has a toilet can be called a "restroom" or "bathroom" in the United States. In other places it may be called the toilet or the water closet (WC).

[[Stegosaurus]]

CATEGORIES: Stegosaurs, Jurassic dinosaurs

Stegosaurus (meaning "roof-lizard") was a type of plant-eating dinosaur which lived in what is now western North America.

Stegosaurus lived in the Upper Jurassic period around 155 to 145 million years ago. It is one of the most easily recognized dinosaurs, with its distinctive double row of kite-shaped plates on its back, and the long spikes on its tail. The armor was necessary as it lived with such meat-eaters as Allosaurus and Ceratosaurus.

[[Psittacosis]]

CATEGORIES: Diseases caused by bacteria

Psittacosis is a bacterial disease that can be caught from birds such as parrots, pigeons, and parakeets. The disease is not common, with only 50 reported cases in the United States each year.

Psittacosis usually gives flu-like symptoms, such as fevers, chills, headaches, muscle aches, and a dry cough. The disease can also look like pneumonia on an x-ray. In rare cases, Psittacosis can cause endocarditis - swelling of joints, and swelling of the cornea. 

Psittacosis can be easily treated with antibiotics, especially with Tetracycline. The disease rarely kills people, with only 1% of those who get the disease dying.

[[Gregorian chant]]

CATEGORIES: Music genres

Gregorian chant is an important form of plainchant, used mainly in the  Roman Catholic Church. With plainchant, all people sing the same music in unison, most of the time. Sometimes, there is a second part, called "organum", which often uses the same melody, but at an interval. This interval is often a fourth or a fifth.

CATEGORIES: Settlements in Gelderland, Municipalities of Gelderland

Barneveld (Nl-Barneveld.oga) is a municipality in the middle of the Netherlands, in the province Gelderland. The main centre is the village of Barneveld. 

The municipality has an area of 176.74 km². 

[[Executable]]

CATEGORIES: Computer file formats

An executable is a computer program written by a programmer and compiled by a compiler (See programming). When it is run, it 'executes' (or does) the actions it was programmed to.  

An example of a compiler is the GNU C Compiler, or GCC for short.  It reads in program code written in the C programming language, and converts it into binary machine code called an executable, so computers can understand it. On Microsoft Windows, these files end with '.exe.' To humans, these files are hard to read. Macs use other file extensions.

[[Windows NT]]

CATEGORIES: Microsoft operating systems

Windows NT is a series of Microsoft's Windows operating systems written in the C and C++ programming languages. They were the first to use their new 'NT' (New Technology) core. That means it had a brand new core to do more things than the MS-DOS-based one that they used in older versions of Windows. Also, it was more secure and crashed less. Windows NT 3.1 was released as alpha versions in 1991-1992 and beta versions in 1993.

[[File extension]]

CATEGORIES: Software, Computer file formats

A file extension or filename extension is a suffix at the end of a filename. It is used to show the type of a computer file. This suggests what program can understand it. For example, MYWORDS.TXT is a plain text file and may be opened by a text editor. Filename extensions come after the name of the file, and many of them are three letters long. 

Some examples of common file extensions are:

There are many other commonly used file extensions.

You can change the program defaults so that the computer knows which program to open each type of file extension with.

[[Lagomorpha]]

CATEGORIES: Lagomorphs

Lagomorpha is a mammal order. It includes pikas, rabbits and hares. Although the lagomorphs look like rodents, they are not so, but are closely related to them. They have four incisors on the upper jaw, not two as in rodents. Also, they only eat plant material, not meat as rodents do to some extent. 

Rabbits were classified under rodents until the 20th century.  They are divided into two families, Leporidae, hares and rabbits, and Ochotonidae, the pikas.

It has been known for some time that the Lagomorpha is an unusual group, and there have been many speculations about its evolution. Darren Naish explains this.

[[Lupus]]

CATEGORIES: Autoimmune diseases

Lupus, or Lupus erythematosus, is a disease of the immune system. It is chronic, which means it does not go away. It is an autoimmune disease, where the person's immune system attacks their own body.

The immune system is partly made up of white blood cells in your body that fight off disease. In lupus, these white blood cells think that the healthy cells of the body around them are diseased, so they end up attacking healthy parts of the body. Lupus can be deadly. It causes swelling and tissue damage, and can attack any part of the body. It most commonly affects the heart, joints, skin, lungs, blood vessels, kidneys and the brain/nervous system. Some symptoms include: fatigue, fever with no cause, hair loss, mouth sores, sensitivity to sunlight, a skin disease, and Raynaud's syndrome. There is treatment for lupus, called immunosuppression, which is medicine that stops the white blood cells from damaging healthy cells for a while. After a while, this medicine wears off, and then the white blood cells go back to hurting healthy parts of the body again. For the disease of lupus, there is no cure that stops the white blood cells from attacking healthy parts of the body forever, but doctors are not giving up on finding a cure.

Lupus takes its name from the Latin word "lupus", meaning wolf. This is because a lupus-caused rash on a person's face makes the person's face look like the face of a wolf. In the United States alone, there may be 270,000 to 1.5 million (1,500,000) people with lupus. Worldwide, it is estimated (not known for sure, but a good guess) that over 5 million (5,000,000) people living with lupus. The disease mainly affects young women, but men can be affected as well.

[[Hiragana]]

CATEGORIES: Writing systems, Japanese language

Hiragana is a part of the Japanese writing system. Japanese writing normally consists of kanji which are used for the main words in a sentence, usually content words, and hiragana which are used for the little words that make up the grammar (in English these would be words like “from” and “his”) called particles. Hiragana is also used for the endings of some of the words.  

Hiragana is a syllabary, which means that each hiragana character stands for a syllable. It is therefore different from a language such as English which uses an alphabet in which most of the letters stand for one bit of sound (phoneme). There is also another syllabary called katakana which is mostly used for foreign words and names. The two kana systems are quite easy to learn, but kanji takes years of practice. In contrast, the kana systems can be learnt in two weeks.

In the past hiragana was considered as women's writing, while men wrote in kanji. Since kanji suit well in Chinese but poorly in Japanese, it was the women who wrote the first Japanese books, poems and songs. Later the Buddhist clerics, such as Rennyo (d. 1498), wrote in hiragana to make the religious message easy to understand so that everyone could read it.

Sometimes the whole of a text may be written in hiragana to make it easy. This would be used in books for young children, or for students starting to learn Japanese, or when writing the lyrics for songs underneath the music where it is important to show how the words fit the music. Some rare or strange kanji may also have so-called furigana characters above it. They are hiragana which show how the kanji is to be pronounced.

In Hiragana each character (kana) is either a vowel (such as "a": あ); a consonant followed by a vowel (such as "ka": か); or, at the end of a syllable, an "n": (ん), although sometimes this sounds more like an “m” or “ng”.

As an example of how the grammatical endings are used we can take the verb “to eat” which is食べる (taberu).  Here the main part of the word “eat” (pronounced “ta” in this case) is the kanji 食.  The other two syllables: “be-ru” are in hiragana (べる).  To say “I ate” or “you ate” etc. you would say “tabemashita”, written食べました (“be-ma-shi-ta” is written in hiragana).

Chiang Kai-shek was a Chinese nationalist politician and military leader who was  President of the Republic of China, born in Xikou on October 31, 1887.  His father was a merchant who died when Chiang was eight years old.  Chiang became an officer in the army of the Manchu empire, but supported the Chinese Xinhai Revolution of 1911 that converted China into a republic. 

He led the Republic of China from 1930 to 1949 on mainland China until he was overthrown by Mao Zedong in the Chinese Civil War. He fled to Taiwan where he ruled from 1950 until his death in 1975, although his government was still officially called the Republic of China.

[[Dark matter]]

CATEGORIES: Astrophysics, Galaxies

Dark matter is a type of matter thought to be responsible for much of the mass in the universe.

The idea arose when astronomers found that the mass of large astronomical objects, and their gravitational effects, was much greater than the mass from the "luminous matter" that contains stars, gas, and dust.

Dark matter was first proposed by Jan Oort in 1932 as a reason for the spinning speeds of stars in the Milky Way. Fritz Zwicky in 1933 used dark matter to explain "missing mass" in the spinning speeds of galaxies in clusters. Later, many other observations have suggested that there is dark matter in the universe. The spinning speeds of galaxies, gravitational lensing of background objects, the temperature distribution of hot gas in galaxies and clusters of galaxies: these are some of the examples that make scientists believe in dark matter.

According to the Planck mission team, and based on the standard model of cosmology, the total mass–energy of the known universe contains 4.9% ordinary matter, 26.8% dark matter and 68.3% dark energy https://web.archive.org/web/20201116211752/https://www.astroamanessence.com/2020/11/dark-energy-and-dark-matter.html. Thus, dark matter is estimated to make up 84.5%  of the total matter in the universe, while dark energy plus dark matter make up 95.1% of the total "stuff" in the universe.

Because dark matter does not seem to give off or reflect light, x-rays, or any other radiation, the instruments that are used to find normal matter (like hot gas, stars, planets, and us) can't find dark matter. It seems that dark matter is not made of the same thing as the matter we see every day on Earth. The only way we can tell if dark matter is there, is by how it affects things we can "see" by gravity.

In 2006, a group of scientists claimed that they had found a way to find dark matter. Since dark matter is supposedly very different from normal matter, it is expected to act differently. The scientists observed two far-away galaxy clusters that had crashed into each other at high speed: normal matter would have been scattered nearby after the collision, while dark matter would not. By measuring gravity, they were able to detect what looked like two clouds of dark matter, with a cloud of normal matter (hot gas) in between them.

[[Katakana]]

CATEGORIES: Writing systems, Japanese language

Katakana is a Japanese script used for writing words borrowed from other languages. It is easier to read than the kanji (the picture method based on Chinese characters). Once the 46 katakana symbols have been learned, the reader knows how to pronounce them.

Katakana and hiragana are both syllabaries. In English we use the letters of the alphabet. In most words each letter stands for a bit of sound (a phoneme). In a syllabary each symbol stands for a syllable. For example: in English we write “Wagamama”: each of the eight letters standing for a sound: “W-a-g-a-m-a-m-a”. But if the word “Wagamama” is divided into syllables there are four syllables (blocks of sound): Wa-ga-ma-ma. In Katakana it is written with four symbols: ワガママ.

Hiragana works in the same way, but the symbols are mostly different. Katakana is perhaps a little easier to learn than Hiragana because the symbols are simpler and more “squared off”. Together Katakana and Hiragana are called “Kana”.

[[Comb]]

CATEGORIES: Basic English 850 words, Care

A comb is a tool used to care for hair or other fibers. It has small pieces sticking out of a main frame; these are called "teeth." A comb is usually flat.

Humans have been using combs as a tool for a long time, at least for 5,000 years. Combs are used by humans to separate tangled hairs, to keep their hair clean and to style their hair. They are also used as a decoration for hair.

Combs are used in the making of thread from fibers like wool or cotton. Combing makes all the fibres point the same way so a thread can be spun.

Perfume is a liquid that gives people, things and rooms a good smell. It is made of oils which give off scent to the surrounding air. The odoriferous compounds that make up a perfume can be manufactured synthetically or extracted from plant or animal sources.

Perfumes were used in the earliest human civilizations. Modern perfumery began in the late 19th century with the commercial synthesis of aroma compounds such as vanillin or coumarin. The artificial compounds gave a wider ranger of scents than natural materials.

Perfume smells more when temperature is warmer. So people put it on the neck, wrist and back of the knee, because these parts are warmer. Eau de Cologne is a type of perfume which can be splashed on the body. It is not so concentrated as the usual perfumes.

[[Magna Carta]]

CATEGORIES: Politics of the United Kingdom, Documents, 13th century in England, Law, 1215

The Magna Carta was a document that was sealed by King John after negotiations with his barons  and their French and Scots allies at Runnymede, Surrey, England in 1215.

There they sealed the Great Charter, called in Latin Magna Carta. It established a council of 25 barons to see John keep to the clauses, including access to swift justice, parliamentary assent for taxation, scutage limitations, and protection from illegal imprisonment.

Because he was forced to seal the charter, John sought approval to break it, from his spiritual overlord Pope Innocent III. Denouncing it as "not only shameful and demeaning but also illegal and unjust", the Pope agreed. The Magna Carta is still considered one of the most important documents ever written, having inspired the way we view issues of justice and liberty and influenced laws regarding such throughout the world.

The Magna Carta has influenced English law right down to the present day. It is one of the most celebrated documents in the History of England. It is recognized as a cornerstone of the idea of the liberty of citizens.

[[Catapult]]

CATEGORIES: Weapons

A catapult is a type of machine used as a weapon to throw rocks, large arrows, or other things such as hot tar, that would cause damage to something else.  Often, catapults were set on higher ground or on castle towers to let them shoot farther.  They shot rocks to break castle walls, or pitch or hot tar to set the target on fire.

Catapults use weights and levers to send the rocks or other things into the air. They do not throw as far as modern weapons do, and are not useful in modern warfare.  Catapults were common in the past, especially the Middle Ages.

Nowadays catapults are used to study old weapons, and as experiments (for example in physics or engineering classes). Some old ones are kept in museums.

Aircraft carriers use much more powerful steam catapults to throw airplanes into the air.

[[Minuet]]

CATEGORIES: Ballroom dances, Musical forms

A minuet is a dance which was popular in the 18th and 19th centuries in France.  It was danced by the aristocracy, especially at the court of King Louis XIV.

Sometimes the French spelling menuet is used, or the Italian minuetto.  It was a moderate or slow dance.  There were always three beats in a bar (3/4 time).

Composers liked the music of the minuet and often wrote them just as pieces of music for a keyboard or other instruments.  Composers like Bach and Handel included them in their suites (collection of dance movements).  Lully started to put them in his operas, often in pairs: Minuet I, Minuet II, then Minuet I repeated.  Often the second minuet would be played by three instruments, so it was called a trio.

In the Classical music period the minuet and trio were used in symphonies and sonatas. They usually formed the third movement of a four movement work. Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven all wrote minuets and trios.  Gradually the minuets became faster so that they were called scherzos.  By the 19th century the waltz had become fashionable among the new middle class.  The polite minuet went out of fashion.

[[Scherzo]]

CATEGORIES: Musical forms

A Scherzo is a piece of music which is quite fast. In the 19th century Romantic composers started to write scherzos in their symphonies and sonatas instead of the traditional minuets. They are similar to a minuet, always with three beats in a bar,  but they are faster and less "polite". Some composers like Chopin and Brahms wrote scherzos as separate pieces for the piano.

[[Biological classification]]

CATEGORIES: Taxonomy

Biological classification is how biologists group organisms.

The classification has its root in the work of Aristotle who invented a multi-ranked system. A great influence was Carolus Linnaeus, who popularized the idea of binomial nomenclature using a  two-part name indicating the genus, and the species. The human species is named Homo sapiens. Names of species are often printed in italics, although there is no obligation to do so (this also goes for names of genera, etc., etc.)

Biological classification is also known as taxonomy. It is a science, and like most sciences has evolved over time. At various times different principles were adopted, and it is not rare for different scientists to use different methods. Since the early 20th century, groupings are supposed to fit the Darwinian principle of common descent. These days, molecular evolution studies, which use DNA sequence analysis as data, are popular. This is often called "phylogenetics", a branch or form of cladism. This approach creates an evolutionary Tree of life (biology) and uses characters (traits) to decide on the branches of the taxonomy.

Sometimes organisms placed in the same group (taxon) are similar; such similarity is not necessarity coincidence. It may be the result of shared descent from a common ancestor.

[[Kingdom (biology)]]

CATEGORIES: Taxonomy

Kingdom is the highest rank, after the domain, which is normally used in the biological taxonomy of all organisms. Each kingdom is split into phyla.

There are 5 to 7 kingdoms in taxonomy. Every living thing comes under one of these kingdoms and some symbionts, such as lichen, come under two. There are at least:

[[Class (biology)]]

CATEGORIES: Taxonomy

A class is a rank used in the biological taxonomy of all organisms. Each class is split into orders. There are multiple classes in each phylum.

Mammals, for example, are one of several classes within the Vertebrates, and are subdivided into Monotremes, Marsupials, and Eutheria.

Ranks below class and above order are often used. Then the sequence is:

[[Order (biology)]]

CATEGORIES: Taxonomy

An order is a rank used in the biological taxonomy. Each order is split into families. There are many orders in each class.A group of closely related families forms an order. The similar characters are less in number as compared to different genera included in family

[[Family (biology)]]

CATEGORIES: Taxonomy

In biology, a family is a  taxonomic rank, or a taxon at that rank. Each family contains one or more genera. The next important rank is that of order. Usually, the name of the family ends with a "idae" for animals, and "aceae" for plants. Sometimes there are also subfamilies and superfamilies. Subfamilies end with "inae" or "oideae".

In Latin, family is "familia". For example, walnuts (genus Juglans) and hickories (genus Carya) both belong to the walnut family (the Juglandaceae). And the family "readcoatius" is under the genus "comingforourknecappius" or the feline family felis

[[Digestion]]

CATEGORIES: Digestive system, Basic English 850 words

Digestion is the process of breaking down food to absorb it. Food is broken down to smaller food particles which are soluble in water. Only then can the food be absorbed into the blood stream.

Digestion occurs in three phases. Mechanical digestion is the physical breakdown of large pieces of food into smaller pieces which can be got at by digestive enzymes. In chemical digestion, enzymes break down food into the small molecules the body can use. Finally, the nutrients are absorbed into the blood stream. Once in the blood stream the nutrients are taken to the liver, which is a kind of chemical factory for the body.

After we swallow food, it travels down a muscular tube to the stomach. There, it is mashed into a mixture like soup. The mixture passes into the small intestine, where tiny bits of food pass into the bloodstream. The food that is still left goes into the large intestine. Finally, waste products leave the body. Digestion usually takes about 18 hours. Food stays in the stomach for about three hours. If uncoiled, the small intestine would be about six meters (20 feet) long. Many digestive tracts are about as long as a bus.

Food slowly enters the small intestine from the stomach. This is where nutrients are taken into the blood. It then enters the large intestine. Water is taken away from it. The food that is left is called feces. The feces are stored in the rectum until the waste can leave the body through the anus.

[[Sight]]

CATEGORIES: Psychology, Vision, Perception

Sight (also called eyesight or vision) is one of the senses. Having sight means to be able to see. Seeing gives animals knowledge of the world. Some simple animals can only tell light from dark, but with vertebrates, the visual system is able to form images.

The ability to interpret visible light information reaching the eyes is called visual perception. Sight is the resulting perception. The components that are necessary for vision are known as the visual system.

[[Pharynx]]

CATEGORIES: Neck

The pharynx is an organ in the back of the throat. It is also the meeting point of the digestive and the respiratory systems. The opening of the respiratory system in the pharynx is called the glottis. It is guarded by a cartilagenous flap called the epiglottis which prevents food or liquid from going into the respiratory system. It closes during swallowing action. As such, it is part of the gastrointestinal system. It comes after the mouth and before the esophagus. Food and air go through the pharynx. The pharynx keeps food and liquids out of the lungs.   

The pharynx has 3 parts:  

[[Jejunum]]

CATEGORIES: Anatomy of the digestive system

The jejunum is a section of the small intestine between the duodenum and the ileum. It is between 1 and 2 meters long.The term "jejunum" derives from the Latin "jejunus," which means "empty of food," "meager," or "hungry." The ancient Greeks noticed at death that this part of the intestine was always empty of food. Hence, the name the jejunum. 

The Latin "jejunus" also gave rise to "jejune" means lacking in nutritive value and devoid of substance, significance or interest, that is dull. A jejune argument is one that is empty (like the jejunum) and totally devoid of interest. 

Famous quote...."Have You Ever Been Punched in The Jejunum?"

[[Air gun]]

CATEGORIES: Firearms

An air gun is a gun which uses gas to fire a projectile instead of burning gunpowder that an ordinary gun uses.

The oldest air guns used a bellows to compress (squeeze) air in a tube. When the gun was fired the air was released. The only way for the air to go was by pushing the pellet out. 

A later invention was the spring piston, these can only fire one shot before the spring has to be reset. Newer guns use air or another gas in a small cartridge, these guns can fire many more shots before the cartridge needs to be changed or refilled.

The projectile for an air gun is usually a pellet. Some guns of this sort fire small round pellets call "bb"s. Some people think this means ball bearing, but it does not. The letters bb stood for a size of shot that was used to make shotgun cartridges, This was used in the first bb guns.

The most popular calibres (pellet sizes) for air weapons are 4 mm 5 (also called .177 to .22). In many countries there are strict rules that limit the sales of air guns so not everyone can have one. 

They are not as powerful as other guns but they can still hurt or even kill people. 

Many people enjoy air rifle and pistol shooting either for fun or hunting. In the Olympics and target games, air pistols are used in some of the shooting events.

[[Blackmail]]

CATEGORIES: Types of crime

Blackmail means threatening to say something bad about someone unless that person pays some money.

If someone has committed a crime, another person might blackmail them. The blackmailer might, for example, say that if the criminal does not give them a large amount of money, they will tell the police.

A blackmailer may threaten to say something embarrassing that someone unless they hand over a sum of money. For example, it maybe something about an intimacy that they are having that they do not want everyone to know about.

Sometimes, a business may blackmail another business. They might threaten to harm that business in some way unless money is paid.

Blackmail is against the law. People who are caught blackmailing may be sent to jail.

[[Bribery]]

CATEGORIES: Types of crime

Bribery means offering something (such as money) to a person in return for some favour which is bad in some way.

The money that is offered is called a bribe, and the verb is to bribe. Active bribery is offering payment and asking for favour, and passive bribery is asking for payment and offering favour. It is still called bribery if the trade is never done.

It is sometimes difficult to decide whether something is a bribe or just a reward. If a father pays his son for washing the car, that is just a reward or payment. However, if a parent pays a child for eating up its dinner, that might be thought of as a bribe because most people would think that is not right.

Bribery can be a crime in more serious cases, such as when a person offers money to hide their own wrongdoing. If a motorist is caught speeding by a policeman and offers the policeman money or a bottle of vodka to persuade him not to report him, that is bribery. If someone wants to take something into a country that is forbidden (or that they would have to pay tax on), they might offer the customs officer a bribe to persuade him to let them through. Some corrupt people will not do their jobs at all (like delivering some package) unless they get a bribe on top of their normal pay.

Those examples are clearly illegal (against the law) and are rare in many countries, but bribery is quite common in business in many parts of the world. It is difficult to do anything without offering bribes in these places. Giving business people presents in the hope that they will want to do business with you may just seem like good manners at times, but in some cases, it may seem more like bribery.

People who are found to be taking bribes can sometimes lose their jobs. In some cases (like the case of the motorist), bribery is against the law.

[[Rubella]]

CATEGORIES: Diseases caused by viruses

Rubella (also known as German measles) is a disease caused by the Rubella virus.

It is often mild and an attack can pass unnoticed. However, this can make the virus very difficult to diagnose.

The disease can last 1–5 days. Children recover more quickly than adults.

The virus usually enters the body through the nose or throat. Like most viruses living along the respiratory tract, it is passed from person to person by tiny droplets in the air that are breathed out.

Rubella can also be transmitted from a mother to her developing baby (fetus) through the placenta.  This can be very dangerous to the fetus, especially if the mother gets rubella early on in her pregnancy.  Rubella can cause deafness, heart problems, intellectual disability, and many other problems in developing fetuses.

The virus has an incubation period of 2 to 3 weeks during which it becomes established. Common symptoms are a red/pink rash, swollen lymph nodes, and a high fever.

The disease is named German measles because it has a similar red rash to measles and was first described in detail by German doctors.

[[Eroticism]]

CATEGORIES: Human sexuality

Eroticism is the quality of sexual excitement. In other words, if something is sexually exciting, then it is said to be erotic. Eroticism is an erotic feeling. It is named after Eros, the Ancient Greek god of love.

Many types of things can be part of eroticism. Things that make a person feel erotic (sexually aroused or excited) include the sight, touch, smell, and sound of another person. A person may feel erotic when they see or touch or smell, or hear someone that they love in a sexual way. 

Sometimes eroticism has nothing to do with another person. A person might feel erotic from watching a movie, looking at pictures in a magazine, listening to a piece of music, reading a story or article, or just thinking their own thoughts, or being aware of their own body. In fact, everything can be eroticism for someone.

[[Tarantella]]

CATEGORIES: Dances

A Tarantella is a very fast dance in 6/8 time. The name comes from the town of Taranto in Italy. People used to believe that if someone was bitten by a tarantula spider they needed to do this dance in order to drive out the poison. The dancer would get more and more excited until he (or she) seemed mad.

Some people think that maybe these people never really believed this, but that it was an excuse to dance at a time when the church said that dancing was not allowed. The spider is, in fact, only a little bit poisonous.

Some composers enjoyed writing fast pieces in 6/8 time which they called "Tarantella". Mendelssohn wrote one as the last movement of his Symphony no 4 (the Italian). Chopin and Liszt also wrote Tarantellas.

[[Ruler]]

CATEGORIES: Measuring tools

A ruler (or 'rule') is an instrument of measurement. Rulers measure length. Length is how long or short something is. Most rulers work by having numbers (parallel to the measuring edge) and little lines (perpendicular to the measuring edge). Rulers can also be used as a straight edge to draw lines with.

Rulers come in many different forms. They can be made of plastic, wood and metal, and other materials. Rulers also come in a variety of lengths. For example, there are 1 metre rulers, 30 centimetre rulers, 20 centimetre rulers and 15 centimetre rulers. These are examples of metric rulers. You can also get 1 yard rulers, 18 inch rulers and 6 inch rulers, etc. These are examples of imperial rulers.

[[Mutation]]

CATEGORIES: Classical genetics, Cell biology

In biology, a mutation is a change in the genetic material. This means changes to the DNA or to the chromosomes which carry the DNA. These changes are heritable (can be passed on to the next generation) unless they have lethal effects.

Mutations can happen for several reasons. It can happen because of errors when meiosis produces the gametes (eggs & sperms). Damage by radiation, or by certain chemicals may cause mutations. Mutations occur at random.

Also, by derivation, an individual carrying the mutation may be called a mutant or a mutation. So is the trait (character) most obviously affected by the mutation.

[[Stingray]]

CATEGORIES: Rays, Venomous animals

The stingrays are a large suborder of the rays. They are cartilaginous fish related to sharks. They are in the suborder Myliobatoidei of the order Myliobatiformes, which consists of nine families.

Most stingrays have one or more barbed stings on the tail, which is used only for self-defence. The sting may reach about 35 cm, and its underside has two grooves with venom glands. The sting is covered with a thin layer of skin, the sheath, in which the venom is held. A few members of the suborder, such as the manta rays and the porcupine ray, do not have stings.

Stingrays are common in coastal tropical and subtropical marine waters throughout the world. There are species in warm temperate oceans, and some found in the ocean. Some live in fresh water. Most stingrays live at or near the bottom of the water, but some are pelagic.

[[Sergei Rachmaninoff]]

Sergei Vasilievich Rachmaninoff (Сергей Васильевич Рахманинов; pronounced rahk-MAH-nin-off) was a famous Russian composer and pianist. He was born on April 1, 1873 (N.S.) and died on March 28, 1943. Because the Russian language uses a different alphabet his name is sometimes spelled in different ways in English (“Sergei” or “Sergey”, and “Rachmaninoff”, “Rachmaninov”, “Rakhmaninov” or “Rakhmaninoff”). "Sergei Rachmaninoff" is the way he spelled his own name when he was in the United States.

Rachmaninoff is considered one of the greatest pianists of the 1900's. He could play extremely difficult music and had very large hands, so that he could play chords with large stretches. It is said that he could play a 13th. Rachmaninoff was a very tall man for his times, standing about 6' 6". Rachmaninoff is also considered a great composer, writing predominantly in the Romantic style, even though he lived most of his adult life in the 1900s, whereas the Romantic style period is usually said to have ended around 1910. His music is characterized by lyrical melodies that are very memorable. His piano compositions are among the most difficult to play in the keyboard repertoire.

[[Turbot]]

CATEGORIES: Flatfish, Edible fish

Turbot is a large flatfish. It is a demersal fish which lives in marine or brackish waters. It is found in the North Atlantic, Baltic Sea and the Mediterranean Sea.

Turbot are fished for food, and have a delicate flavour. They are farmed in a number of countries, and are quite expensive in restaurants.

When caught, professional fishermen often make small cuts through the bone near the tailfin. This lets the blood out and keeps the meat white. Storing the Turbot upside down also helps in keeping the underside of the fish white.

Rosa Louise McCauley Parks (February 4, 1913 – October 24, 2005) was an African-American civil rights activist. She was called "the mother of the Modern-Day American civil rights movement" and "the mother of the freedom movement".  

Parks is best known for what she did in her home town of Montgomery, Alabama on December 1, 1955 While she sat in a seat in the middle of the bus, the bus driver told her to move to the back of the bus so a white passenger could take the seat in the front of the bus. During this time, when there were no white seats for white people, black people were told to get up out of their seat. Parks refused to move. She was a member of the local chapter of National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). Like so many others she was tired of being treated as a lower class person because of the color of her skin. 

She was arrested. This led to the Montgomery bus boycott. The boycott lasted 381 days. This caused a change in the law. After that, black people were able to sit wherever they wanted to on the bus. Her refusal to let others treat her differently was an important symbol in the campaign against racial segregation.

Hideki Tōjō (30 December 1884 – 23 December 1948) was a leader of Japan during most of World War 2.

Hideki Tōjō was born on 30 December 1884 in Tokyo, Japan. He was the third son of a lieutenant general in the Imperial Japanese Army named Hidenori Tōjō. Tōjō had two older brothers but they died before he was born. 

In 1909, he married a woman named Katsuko Ito and he had seven children with her: three sons and four daughters.

In the 1930s, Hideki Tōjō fought in the Sino-Japanese war, leading Japanese forces in occupied Manchuria. He returned to Tokyo in 1940 and held ministerial posts, where he urged an alliance with Germany and Italy against the Allied forces. Tojo became Prime Minister in 1941 and within two months ordered a surprise attack on U.S. naval forces in Hawaii. (The subsequent attack on Pearl Harbor was planned by Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto.) 

After Japan surrendered, American troops went to arrest Tojo and surrounded his house. He shot himself four times in the chest, but missed and the bullets hit his stomach. Disarmed and with blood gushing out of his chest, Tojo began to talk. He said, "I am very sorry it is taking me so long to die. The Greater East Asia War was justified and righteous. I am very sorry for the nation and all the races of the Greater Asiatic powers. I wait for the righteous judgment of history. I wished to commit suicide but sometimes that fails." 

After his injuries healed, the Allies found Tojo guilty of war crimes and hanged him in Tokyo on 23 December 1948.

[[Worker]]

CATEGORIES: Employment, Labor

A worker is a person who works. This usually means a person who does manual labour, like manufacturing goods. In economics there are three factors of production. These are labour (the work done by workers), land (usually people need some space to produce something), and capital (it will cost resources, or money, to produce something).

People who work, usually get paid for the work they do. This is either called wages (if it is bound to a time period, like an hour), or a salary (if it is independent of the time taken). 

May Day is an international holiday for workers' rights.

CATEGORIES: Working dogs, Service animals

Guide dogs are dogs trained to help blind people live on their own.  They are sometimes called "Seeing Eye" dogs. Guide dogs are one type of assistance animals, which are animals trained to help people with a disability to lead more complete lives.

The blind person (sometimes called a "handler") and the dog need to work together. Both the dog and the handler must take special training to learn how to work as a team. The handler needs to let the guide dog know the direction they want to go. The dog can lead the person around things that may be dangerous, such as moving cars or other things. Also, guide dogs may be taught to press buttons to work elevators or get things for their handler.  Because dogs cannot see colors as well as people, they cannot read traffic signals, so the handler must use ways to tell if it is safe to cross a street.

Because the guide dog and handler will be in public, it is important that the dog stays calm in busy or loud areas. In many countries, guide dogs are allowed inside places where animals normally are not allowed, such as restaurants, stores, buses and trains.

[[Phycology]]

CATEGORIES: Algae

Phycology (or algology), a part of botany, is the study of algae. Algae are important as primary producers in aquatic ecosystems. Most algae are eukaryotic, photosynthetic organisms that live in a wet environment. They are different from the higher plants by a lack of "normal" roots, stems or leaves. Many types have one cell and are very small or microscopic (including plankton and other microalgae); many others have many cells; some of these are very big, like seaweeds such as kelp and Sargassum.

Phycology includes the study of prokaryotic forms known as blue-green algae or cyanobacteria. Some microscopic algae are also in lichens.

[[Snorkeling]]

CATEGORIES: Water sports

Snorkeling is swimming while using a tube to breathe underwater. Snorkeling is a very popular activity, particularly in places with clear, calm, warm oceans. It allows people to see underwater life in a natural setting, without the complicated equipment and training required for scuba diving. 

Generally, people snorkel in shallow reefs ranging from sea level to 4 meters (13 feet) deep. Snorkelers can also explore deep water reefs.  However, to see deeper reefs, a snorkeler has to hold their breath and dive down to the reef to see it. This kind of snorkeling takes more skill and fitness than shallow water snorkeling. It is also more dangerous than shallow water snorkeling.

Snorkelers use masks so they can see underwater. This allows them to see fish, coral reefs, and other kinds of sea life.

[[Grave (mass)]]

CATEGORIES: Old units of measurement, Units of mass

Grave, shortened as gv, was the word that was used to describe mass before the word kilogram was introduced. Grave comes from the word gravity and was first used in 1793 in France. The name kilogram was introduced in 1795 but was not the official word for mass until 1875.

In order to have full consistency in the International System of Units (SI), many people think that the kilogram should be called something different. Using the word kilogram creates a problem because it is a base unit that has the prefix "kilo" already in its name. To fix the problem, some people have suggested using the word grave again.

The Smiths were an English rock band from Manchester. They formed in 1982 and split up in 1987. They released four studio albums. The band consisted of Morrissey (singing), Johnny Marr (guitar), Andy Rourke (bass) and Mike Joyce (drums). Critics have called them the most important alternative rock band to emerge from the British independent music scene of the 1980s. Q magazine writer Simon Goddard wrote that The Smiths were the one truly important group of the 1980s, "the most influential British guitar group of the decade" and the first independent group to become successful in the main music scene.

The band was based on the songwriting partnership of Morrissey and Marr. They signed to the independent record label Rough Trade Records. On this, they released four studio albums: The Smiths (1984), Meat Is Murder (1985), The Queen Is Dead (1986) and Strangeways, Here We Come'' (1987). They have also released several compilations, and many singles that were not released on any of their studio albums.

The Smiths had several singles reach the UK top twenty. All four of their albums reached the UK top five, including one which topped the charts. They won a large following of fans. The band had limited commercial success outside the UK while they were still together. The band broke up in 1987 and have refused several offers to reunite.

The music focuses on a guitar, bass and drum sound. They blend 1960s rock and post-punk. This sounded very different to the synthesiser-based contemporary dance pop that was popular in the early 1980s. Marr's guitar playing on his Rickenbacker often had a jangly sound influenced by Roger McGuinn of the 1960s group The Byrds. It influenced later bands from Manchester, such as The Stone Roses and Oasis. Morrissey's lyrics combined stories about ordinary people's lives with a sense of humour.

[[Allotheria]]

CATEGORIES: Mammals, Fossils

The Allotheria are an extinct infraclass or superorder of mammals. They are related to the prototheria and theria.

The allotheres was a branch of successful Mesozoic mammals. The most important characteristic was the presence of lower molariform teeth with two longitudinal rows of cusps.

Allotheres also had a narrow pelvis, indicating that they gave birth to tiny, helpless young as marsupials do.

The Haramiyida from the Triassic period were the earliest group, and the Multituberculates survived until the Oligocene, 35 million years ago.

[[Multituberculate]]

CATEGORIES: Mammals, Fossils

The multituberculates were a group of rodent-like mammals which survived for about 166 million years – the longest fossil history of any mammal line.

They were eventually outcompeted by rodents, becoming extinct during the late Eocene. 

At least 200 species are known, ranging from mouse-sized to beaver-sized. These species occupied many  ecological niches, ranging from burrow-dwelling to squirrel-like tree-dwelling. 

Multituberculates are usually placed outside both the two main groups of living mammals, the Theria (placentals and marsupials), and monotremes. Some cladistic analyses put them closer to Theria than to monotremes.

[[Gondwanatheria]]

CATEGORIES: Mammals, Fossils, Gondwana

Gondwanatheria is an extinct group of mammals that lived during the Upper Cretaceous to the Miocene. They lived in the Southern Hemisphere continents which had been part of the supercontinent Gondwana. 

These mammals are known only from isolated teeth and a few lower jaws. Because of these fragmentary remains, their relationships are unclear. Later finds have improved our knowledge of them. It was thought previously that climate changes at the Eocene–Oligocene boundary had caused their extinction.

Fossils have come from South America, India and Antarctica, where gondwanatherids lived in the lush forests which once covered much of the world.

[[South Tarawa]]

CATEGORIES: Capital cities in Oceania, Settlements in Kiribati

South Tarawa (in Gilbertese and English: Teinainano Urban Council or abr. TUC) is the capital city of the country Kiribati. It is on an island called Tarawa Atoll. The meaning of Teinainano is "down of the mast", referring to the sail-shape of the atoll.

The South Tarawa population center is made up of all the small islands between Bairiki (on the west) to Temaiku on the east. All of separated islands are joined by causeways, forming one long island on the reef along the southern side of the Tarawa Lagoon. There is also a new causeway—the Japanese Causeway—that links South Tarawa to Betio. South Tarawa is at 1°19' North, 172°58' East (1.31667, 172.9667). 

There is a Kiribati Teacher College and one University of the South Pacific center on South Tarawa. Bairiki is sometimes considered the capital of Kiribati because at one time both the Parliament, the Presidency and main administrative offices were located there. The Parliament meets on Ambo island; Government department are spread among South Tarawa, Betio and Christmas Island.

The Roman Catholic diocese and the Kiribati Protestant Church are on South Tarawa. Bairiki (executive), Ambo (legislative), Betio (judicial) are the main places of the capital.

[[Bairiki]]

CATEGORIES: Villages, Settlements in Kiribati

Bairiki is a village and an island now part of South Tarawa, and one time is the center of government of Kiribati. One of three post offices on Tarawa is located at Bairiki. Bairiki Island is the most southern island on the atoll of Tarawa. About nine islands are larger than Bairiki.

Bairiki includes the main administrative center of Kiribati, but the Parliament has since moved to Ambo, halfway between Bairiki and Bonriki. In the village there is a small port and near Bairiki is a center of the University of the South Pacific.

[[Audio engineer]]

CATEGORIES: Entertainment occupations, Music industry, Engineering

An audio engineer (or simply engineer for short) is a person who operates, and usually chooses and sets up recording equipment. The term applies mainly to a person who works in a recording studio but can also apply to people who do the same kind of work, in other places. An engineer may work with multitrack recordings or stereophonic remixes.

Audio engineering deals with the recording and reproduction of sound through mechanical and electronic  means and is a part of audio science. The field draws on many disciplines, including electrical engineering, acoustics, and music. An audio engineer is closer to the creative and technical aspects of audio than an acoustical engineer.

Some amateur (and a few professional) engineers are self-taught, and learn mostly by doing, or with the help of an instruction manual. Many engineers started in other studio jobs (such as running errands), and learned about recording as they became familiar with the studio where they worked. An engineer learns about the use and placement of microphones, how to operate and maintain an audio mixer, recording deck, sound effects, and other machines, and how to switch between live and recorded sounds, to make the best, and often the most unique, recording possible. A good engineer will strive to make recordings that are both of high technical quality, and also pleasing to hear.

Starting wages may be small in recording studios, and many beginners work as unpaid volunteers. Experienced engineers, especially those who have worked on a hit record, may command a large wage. Some engineers are paid a salary, while others may earn hourly pay (sometimes based on the studio's rates), or be paid per session. Many go on to start their own recording studios, or maintain a private studio or mobile recording service. A few work only for a single recording artist, band, or producer.

Several colleges and universities in the United States and other countries offer classes in recording, which may cover its history, its uses, and of course technique and technical knowledge. Some schools offer degree or diploma programs in Recording. Graduating such a program does not guarantee a person a studio job, but increases one's chances, and can provide better preparation for such a career.

Besides studio work, some engineers have one or more specialties, such as making new digital versions of old recordings, as consultants to places that give concerts and live performances, and sometimes as expert witnesses in court trials, when sounds or a recording may be important to the outcome of a case.

[[Groundhog]]

CATEGORIES: Squirrels, Mammals of North America, Rodents

The groundhog (also known as the chuck, wood-shock, groundpig, whistlepig, whistler, thickwood badger, Canada marmot, monax, moonack, weenusk, red monk, or siffleux) is a rodent. It belongs to the group of ground squirrels. Those squirrels are also known as marmots. The animal may also be called woodchuck, or whistlepig. Groundhogs dig tunnels and live underground. Groundhog holes, called burrows, are easy to recognize; they are holes, about 9.in (inches) (23 cm (centimeters)) wide which usually have large piles of dirt and rocks at the entrance. Every single hole, may have tunnels which lead to as many as ten other holes, the tunnels are very large and can have chambers, like rooms, in them. Groundhogs can make their homes under trees, around buildings and in open fields. 

[[Squirrel]]

CATEGORIES: Squirrels

Squirrels are a large family of small to medium rodents. It includes tree squirrels, which are described on this page.

The other squirrels are: ground squirrels, chipmunks, marmots (including groundhogs), flying squirrels, and prairie dogs. 

Squirrels are native to the Americas, Eurasia, and Africa, and have been introduced to Australia. The earliest known squirrels date from the Eocene and are most closely related to the mountain beaver and to the dormouse among living rodent families.

Most squirrels are omnivores; they eat anything they find.  Many kinds of squirrels live in trees, so they often find nuts. They eat seeds, berries and pine cones too. Sometimes they eat bird's eggs and insects. Most tree squirrels store food in the fall, to eat in the winter. Ground squirrels do not store food. They hibernate which means they spend winter in a deep sleep. 

Squirrels have many predators or enemies. Foxes, wolves, coyotes, bears, raccoons, lynx, cougars, eagles, hawks and owls eat squirrels. 

[[Gestation]]

CATEGORIES: Biological reproduction

Gestation is the carrying of an embryo or fetus inside a female viviparous animal, until its birth. Mammals can have more than one embryo or fetus at the same time.

The time between fertilization of an ovum and the birth of the young is called the gestation period. Humans have a gestation period of around 37 weeks or about 9 months and 1 week. Syrian hamsters have a gestation period of 16 days. That is believed to be the shortest gestation period. The time the gestation period takes depends on the size of the animal, smaller ones have short lengths and bigger ones have the opposite.

[[Shrew]]

CATEGORIES: Eulipotyphla

Shrews are small mammals which look rather like mice. They were classified in the old Insectivora, but that is no longer used. Now they are classified in the family Soricidae, suborder Soricomorpha.

True shrews are not to be confused with West Indies shrews, treeshrews, otter shrews, or elephant shrews, which belong to different families or orders.

Although its external appearance is generally that of a long-nosed mouse, a shrew is not a rodent, as mice are. In fact it is related to moles. Shrews have sharp, spike-like teeth, not the familiar gnawing front incisor teeth of rodents.

Shrews are distributed almost worldwide. Of the major tropical and temperate land masses, only New Guinea, Australia, and New Zealand do not have any native shrews. In South America, shrews are relatively recent immigrants and are present only in the northern Andes. In terms of species diversity, the shrew family is the fourth most successful mammal family.

[[Ground squirrel]]

CATEGORIES: Squirrels

Ground squirrels are marmots. These are small rodents, squirrels which live on and in the ground.

Most of them live in the mountains, like the Sierra Nevada, or the Alps. Marmots make holes in the ground. They live in burrows, underground. They hibernate, that is they sleep through the winter. Marmots are very social animals. They group together easily. They also like to communicate with each other, with whistles, especially when they sense danger.

They vary in size and habits. Most are able to rise up on their hind legs and stand fully erect comfortably for long periods. This way they watch for predators. They tend to live together more than other squirrels, and many live in colonies with complex social structures. Most Marmotini are rather short-tailed and large squirrels. The Alpine marmot (Marmota marmota) is the largest living member of the Sciuridae, at 53–73 cm in length and weighing 5–8 kg.

Many historians suggest that marmots, rather than rats, were the carriers of bubonic plague epidemics in the Middle Ages.

[[Human Be-In]]

CATEGORIES: 1967 in California, Popular culture, 20th century in San Francisco

The  'Human Be-In'  was an event during the afternoon and evening of January 14, 1967. It was held in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park. The Human Be-In caused the Summer of Love, which introduced hippie life and the word psychedelic to everyday Americans, and made the Haight-Ashbury area of San Francisco famous because it was the center of an American counterculture.

The hippie movement had two main sources. One source was college students who were not happy about the way the country was headed. They did not like the way African Americans were being treated in the South or the way young men were being drafted to fight in the Vietnam War. The other source of the hippie movement was the 'Beat Generation' (poets and jazz hipsters).

Throughout the early 1960s, college students who were against the policies of segregation in Southern United States would travel to the south. They took part in sit-ins, register African Americans to vote, demonstrate, march, and other activism. More and more people were unhappy about the Vietnam War and the riots. During this time, San Francisco was becoming a center for younger people who liked to experiment with drugs, and it was also a center for the music scene. From the idea of the 'sit-in', they got the idea to have a 'Human Be-In' in early January to get people's minds off politics and the war.

The Human Be-In was announced on the cover of the first issue of the San Francisco Oracle as "A Gathering of the Tribes for a Human Be-In". Speakers at the rally included Timothy Leary, Richard Alpert (soon to be more widely known as 'Ram Dass'), and poets like Allen Ginsberg, who chanted mantras, and Gary Snyder. Leary set the tone that afternoon with his famous phrase "Turn On, Tune In, Drop Out". Other counterculture leaders who were there included comedian Dick Gregory, Lenore Kandel, and Jerry Rubin. The Hells Angels, at the peak of their 'outlaw' reputation, looked after lost children. Local rock bands such as Grateful Dead and Quicksilver Messenger Service provided the music, and Owsley "Bear" Stanley provided massive amounts of his "White Lightning" LSD to the gathered masses.

Soon every gathering was being called an '-In' of some kind. Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In, a television comedy series, began to appear on NBC just a year later, January 22, 1968.

During 1967, more and more young people from around the country began traveling to San Francisco. By the summer there were between 100,000 and 200,000 there taking part in the "Summer of Love".

[[Example]]

CATEGORIES: Basic English 850 words

An example (Latin exemplum, the shorthand e.g. stands for exempli gratia, which means for example) is a short story, or an anecdote. This story is told to illustrate something else, like an idea or a concept.

In the Middle Ages, preachers and priests used examples in their sermons. They did this to explain things from the bible. They also did this to explain to all those people (that were incapable of reading) how they should lead their lives, as a good person.

Examples help illustrate a point. 

The phrase "make an example" is sometimes used, when a person is harshly punished for others to see. This is done to keep other people (especially the person's peers) from doing the same thing that got that person into trouble.

[[Kangaroo rat]]

CATEGORIES: Geomyoid rodents

Kangaroo rats are small rodents from North and Central America. They got their name, because they look like small kangaroos, when standing upright. But they are not related to kangaroos, except that they are mammals. The genus of the kangaroo rats is called Dipodomys.

Currently, there are 22 species in that genus. They vary in size from 10cm to 20cm, and they weigh between 35 and 180 grams for adult animals.

Kangaroo rats live in dry climates.They can live in deserts also, like Thar Desert. This means that they have developed traits to other species that live in such climates, but are not related to them. Some of those species are the jerboas, which can be found in the deserts of Africa and Asia, and the hopping mice of the Australian Outback. 

All of those species have highly developed hind legs. They also live in deep burrows that protect them from the worst heat of the day. Water may be difficult to find in such climates. Therefore, they only rarely need to drink water. Instead, they have a very efficient metabolism. Their kidneys are much more efficient than human kidneys. They can also chemically split off water from the food they eat. 

Kangaroo mice are found in areas of the United States and Mexico, where there is some grass or vegetation left, but which have a rather dry climate.  Scientists call those areas arid and semi-arid. The animals live on seeds, leaves, nuts and other fruit they can find. They also catch insects. They are also known for stockpiling (keeping) some food in their burrows, for bad times. 

Usually the animals have a color that blends in nicely with the sandy surroundings. Most often they are a tone of dark yellow to deep brown.

They are nocturnal which means that they are  active during the night. 

[[Hibernation]]

CATEGORIES: Physiology

Hibernation is a time of inactivity. Some endothermic (warm-blooded) animals hibernate, usually during the winter, when food is short. They fall into a sleep-like state. They regulate their metabolism to consume less energy. They lower their body temperature, slow their breathing, and slow other vital functions. During hibernation, the body uses fat for energy, which the animal has gathered in summer and autumn. They hibernate from the end of autumn to the start of winter. Animals try and eat as much as they can to increase the fats in their body.

Mammals like bats, ground squirrels (like marmots), hedgehogs, marsupials and others hibernate.

The phases of sleeping (called torpor) are different for the different animals. Hedgehogs sleep for 1–3 weeks, without waking, The fat dormouse sleeps for 20–33 days, without waking. The winter sleep of bears is not as deep as hibernation.

Only mammals hibernate. However, a few birds including hummingbirds do something similar.

[[Pack rat]]

CATEGORIES: Rodents

The pack rat, also known as the wood rat or trade rat, is a rodent of one of several species in the genus Neotoma. Very often, people mean the bushy-tailed woodrat (Neotoma cinerea). Packrats are common in the deserts and highlands of the western United States and northern Mexico. They are smaller than a usual (Old World) rat, and usually have long, sometimes bushy tails. They are also not related to the rat, other than also being a rodent.

[[Serial ATA]]

CATEGORIES: Storage devices, Computer buses

Serial ATA (SATA or Serial Advanced Technology Attachment) is a standard that has been defined to connect storage devices or optical drives to a computer. The most common standard that was used beforehand was called ATA or IDE; it has been renamed PATA. The main difference between the two lies in the cables: SATA cables have seven wires, PATA cables have 40 or 80. Another difference is that with SATA, there is one cable for each device, while with PATA, all devices are connected to the same cable.   

As of 2015, almost all desktop computers have a SATA interface. PATA is still used for industrial applications and embedded systems.

[[Coat of arms of Estonia]]

CATEGORIES: Estonia, National coats of arms

The coat of arms of Estonia is a golden shield which includes three slim, blue leopards (or lions passant guardant) in the middle, with oak branches along the side of the shield.

The coat of arms of Estonia has existed long before they were official recognized after the War of Independence between 1918 and 1920, when the Republic of Estonia was internationally recognized.

The symbol has been in use since the 13th century, where  the big coat of arms was used for the capital city, Tallinn. The origin of the slim blue lions can be traced back to the King of Denmark at the time, Valdemar the Second. As Denmark was the ruling power of Northern Estonia at the time, it imposed the coat of arms upon the state.

[[Apatosaurus]]

CATEGORIES: Diplodocids

Apatosaurus is a sauropod dinosaur which lived in the Upper Jurassic period. It is in the same family as Diplodocus. Brontosaurus was once thought a later name for Apatosaurus, but is now proved to be a separate genus.

Apatosaurus grew as big as 21 meters long, 4.5 meters tall at the hip, and weighed up to 23 metric tons. It ate plants. Its bones have been found in Wyoming, Colorado, Oklahoma, and Utah.

When it was first found, scientists thought that Apatosaurus lived partly under water, since it could not hold its own weight on dry land. Now they think it lived on dry land, probably in herds.

The cervical vertebrae were less elongated and more solid than those of Diplodocus. The bones of the leg were much stockier (despite being longer), implying a more robust animal. The tail was held above the ground during normal locomotion. Like most sauropods, Apatosaurus had only a single large claw on each forelimb, with the first three toes on the hind limb possessing claws.

There are at least two species of Apatosaurus:

[[Trojan horse (computing)]]

CATEGORIES: Malware

A trojan horse (often just called trojan) is a kind of software that is used for malicious purposes.  A trojan horse is a special type of malware that pretends to do a certain thing, but in reality, it does something else, such as allow a stranger to read and change the computer's information. In some cases the user notices, in other cases they do not. Spyware programs are examples of programs that work as trojans.

Trojans are generally spread by some form of trickery, for example getting users to click on bad popups, Email, text,  attachments, advertisements, or fake device driver updates. A trojan may act as a "backdoor" to the computer, contacting a controller which can then have unauthorized access to the affected computer. Trojans may also access users' personal information such as banking information, passwords, or personal identity.  It can infect other devices connected to their networks. 

It is rare to get a trojan on your computer by merely visiting a website, though it can happen. Usually, though, trojans are attached to something the user downloads, such as music, wallpapers, backgrounds, games, and especially programs (apps). 

Trojans were named after the Trojan Horse in Greek mythology, which was a large wooden horse, given by the Trojans (from Troy) to the Greeks (from Greece) as a gift, but when the Greeks brought it inside their city walls, Trojan soldiers came out and defeated the city.

[[Legacy]]

CATEGORIES: History, Law

In law, a legacy is something that someone gets by inheritance, or by a will.  In historical terms, a legacy is something that is handed down from one period of time to another period of time. Often it means something handed down from an ancestor or predecessor.

In loose terms, it is sometimes said that a countries or civilizations can leave a legacy, such as an idea that will be remembered for a long time. That is clearly an extension of its original meaning(s) which were about individual people.

Buddha and Confucius and other religious and philosophical teachers have left moral legacies. 

More than 2000 years ago the Greek Mathematician, Euclid of Alexandria, collected and wrote down ideas about geometry and measurement in a text called Elements. Students still use these ideas when they learn about mathematics. Other sciences also owe inherited much from Ancient Greece, and science, in general, is a system of legacies. Greek science developed from Ancient Egyptian and Babylonian science, as Islamic science used its own legacy rather than of those of other cultures. Renaissance science built on its predecessors, as did modern science.

In Athens, citizens voted on what the city would do. This early form of democracy is a cultural legacy. Ancient Rome elected some of their leaders and made Roman laws that became a legal legacy for later civilizations. Roman and Greek architecture are also often imitated, as another kind of legacy.

Some families pass objects and ideas down from generation to generation.  These heirlooms and ideas can also be called legacies.  It may have to do with a person or many people.  Individuals can leave a historical legacy.

Legacy is a similar concept as inheritance and heritage. It is something we inherit from past generations and pass to our future generations. Usually, heritage refers to material and economical inheritance, while legacy refers to immaterial and cultural inheritance.

When software source code is reused in new software development, the old code is often called legacy code.

[[Common Era]]

CATEGORIES: Time

Common Era (CE; aera vulgaris)  is a method used to identify a year. It means "a year in our time" (rather than a year a very long time ago). It is the system for recording dates used almost everywhere around the world today: it is in common use. 

CE is an alternative to the AD, system used by Christians but the numbers are the same: this year is CURRENTYEAR CE or equally AD CURRENTYEAR (but usually we just say "this year is CURRENTYEAR").  AD is an abbreviation of no. People who are not Christian may not be willing to accept that a religion should be named when a date is written. For this reason, another way to write a date was needed. The name Christian Era (no) is another name for Common Era.

When writing about calendars, an era is span of dates, starting from a particular moment in time. In the case of both CE and AD, that start date is approximately the date of the birth of Jesus of Nazareth. Neither system uses a year zero (0): the year before 1 CE was 1 BCE.

[[Sheet music]]

CATEGORIES: Music

Sheet music is a type of printed music. The music that musicians have in front of them when they play is printed music.  The sheet or sheets of paper that contain(s) the written notation of what the musician are to play is called printed music.  Sheet music usually refers to a "single sheet" of music; that is, one song or piece printed separately.  Printed music includes sheet music but also includes music published in collections.  People often confuse sheet music with printed music.  

Sheet music can be published as a separate copy for one piece or song, or it can be a collection of pieces in a larger book. If there is a piece of music for violin and piano, then the pianist will play from the piano part, which will have the piano music written, as usual, on two staves.  Above those two staves, printed slightly smaller, will be another stave with the violin part.  The violinist will play from a separate part which will just have the violin music.  This means that the pianist can always see what the violin should be playing, but the violinist will not be able to see what the pianist is playing.  The violinist may need to look at the piano part sometimes to see how the violin and piano part fit together.  It would be difficult for the violinist to play from music with both parts because he would need to turn the pages too often.  (Unless the violinist had a few measures of rest right before the page turn, the violinist would miss playing some of his/her part while turning the page.)

Funafuti is the capital of the small island nation of Tuvalu. It has a population of 4,492 (2002), making it the most populated atoll in this country. It is a narrow sweep of land between 20 and 400 meters wide. There is an airstrip, hotel (Vaiaku Langi Hotel), and administrative buildings, as well as homes, constructed both in the traditional manner, out of palm fronds, and more recently out of cement blocks. The most prominent building on Funafuti atoll is the Church of Tuvalu. Other sites of interest are the remains of American aircraft that crashed on Funafuti during World War II, when the airstrip was used by the American forces to defend the Gilbert Islands (now Kiribati). The United States claimed Funafuti until a treaty of friendship was concluded in the late 70's or early 80's.

The largest island is Fongafale. On this island, there are four villages, of which one is Vaiaku, where the government is. The capital of Tuvalu is sometimes given as Fongafale or Vaiaku, but the entire atoll of Funafuti is actually the capital.

[[Cantonese language]]

CATEGORIES: Sino-Tibetan languages, Linguistics, Languages of China

Cantonese is an East Asian language which comes from Canton, southern China. Often, people use the word 'Cantonese' to refer to the Guangzhou dialect, Hong Kong dialect, Xiguan dialect, Wuzhou dialect and Tanka dialect of Yue. However, linguists prefer to keep the name 'Cantonese' for the Yue dialect of Guangzhou (Canton) and Hong Kong. Using this classification, Cantonese is the prestige dialect of Yue.

Cantonese is spoken by people in Southern China, Hong Kong, Macau, Malaysia and Singapore, as well as places with many overseas Chinese who came from Cantonese-speaking parts of China, such as Melbourne. It is also the most common language of overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia and North America. It is said that over 100,000,000 people speak Cantonese. It is a tonal language with 6 kinds of tones. While Cantonese is only the third most spoken dialect of Chinese, only behind Mandarin and Wu, its official status in Hong Kong and Macau make it widely known among other Chinese dialects.

Even though Cantonese is called a dialect of Chinese, Cantonese is so different from Mandarin, the most spoken dialect of Chinese, that they are mutually unintelligible, meaning that speakers of one language cannot understand the other language without learning it beforehand. It is said that Cantonese is more closely related to Classical Chinese than Mandarin.

Cantonese is from the Sino-Tibetan family of languages.

[[Skirt]]

[[Red blood cell]]

CATEGORIES: Blood cells, Physiology

Red blood cells (also known as RBCs, red blood corpuscles or erythrocytes) are cells in the blood which transport oxygen. In women, there are about 4.8 million red blood cells per microliter of blood. In men, there are 5.4 million red blood cells per microliter of blood. Red blood cells are red because they have hemoglobin in them.

== Function == 

The most important function of red blood cells is the transport of oxygen (O2) to the tissues. The hemoglobin absorbs oxygen in the lungs. Then it travels through blood vessels and brings oxygen to all other cells via the heart. The blood cells go through the lungs (to collect oxygen), through the heart (to give all cells oxygen). They go back to the heart to be re-pumped to the lungs (to again collect oxygen), so the blood in your body travels in a double circuit, going through your heart twice before it completes one full circulation of the body.

Red blood cells are doughnut-shaped, but without the hole. This shape is called a bi-concave disc. However, hereditary diseases such as sickle-cell disease can cause them to change shapes and stop blood flow in capillaries and veins. Plasma is got from whole blood. To prevent clotting, an anticoagulant (such as citrate) is added to the blood immediately after it is taken.

[[Jöns Jakob Berzelius]]

CATEGORIES: 1779 births, 1848 deaths, Swedish scientists, Chemists

Jöns Jakob Berzelius (20 August 1779 – 7 August 1848) was a Swedish chemist. He invented the modern chemical notation. Berzelius, John Dalton and Antoine Lavoisier are said to be the fathers of modern chemistry.

Berzelius was born in Linköping in Östergötland in Sweden. He graduated from Uppsala University as a physician. He became a professor in medicine and surgery at the Stockholm School of Surgery in 1807. In 1810, this became part of Medico-Chirurgiska Institutet (later the Karolinska Institute) and Berzelius became a professor of chemistry and pharmacy.

Not long after going to Stockholm, Berzelius wrote a chemistry textbook for his medical students. While doing experiments for the textbook, he found that inorganic compounds are made of different elements in proportion by weight. Based on this, in 1828, he created a table of relative atomic weights. On this table, oxygen was set to 100. The table had all of the elements known at the time. This work gave evidence of the atomic hypothesis that 

chemical compounds are made of atoms combined in whole number amounts. 

In order to help his experiments, Berzelius created a system of chemical notation. In this notation, the elements were given simple written labels, for example, O for oxygen, or Fe for iron. The proportions of the elements was shown by numbers. This is the same basic system used today. The only difference is that instead of the subscript number used today (for example, H2O), Berzelius used a superscript.

Berzelius found the chemical elements silicon, selenium, thorium, and cerium. Students working in Berzelius laboratory also found lithium and vanadium.

Berzelius was the first person to show the difference between organic compounds (those made with carbon), and inorganic compounds. He helped Gerhardus Johannes Mulder in his analysis of organic compounds such as coffee, tea and many proteins. The term "protein" itself was created by Berzelius, after Mulder noticed that all proteins seemed to have the same formula and might be made of a single type of a (very large) molecule.

Berzelius wrote a great deal. He helped many leading scientists (such as Mulder, Claude Louis Berthollet, Humphry Davy, Friedrich Wöhler and Eilhard Mitscherlich), and many less-notable scientists.

[[Antibody]]

CATEGORIES: Cell biology, Immunology

Antibodies (also called immunoglobulins) are large Y-shaped proteins that can stick to the surface of bacteria and viruses. They are found in the blood or other body fluids of vertebrates. Antibodies are the key element in the adaptive immune system.

The antibody recognizes a unique part of the foreign target called an antigen. Each tip of the "Y" of an antibody contains a structure (like a lock) that fits one particular key-like structure on an antigen. This binds the two structures together.

Using this binding mechanism, an antibody can tag a microbe or an infected cell for attack by other parts of the immune system, or can neutralize its target directly. The production of antibodies is the main function of humoral immunity.

Each antibody is different. They are all designed to attack only one kind of antigen (in practice, this means virus or bacteria). For instance, an antibody designed to destroy smallpox is unable to hit the bubonic plague or the common cold.

Though the general structure of all antibodies is very similar, that small region at the tip of the protein is extremely variable. This allows millions of antibodies with different tip structures to exist. Each of these variants can bind to a different antigen. This enormous diversity of antibodies allows the immune system to recognize an equally wide variety of antigens.

[[Anura]]

CATEGORIES: Frogs

The order Anura includes the frogs and toads. They are the most successful living amphibia, judged by number of species. There are about 7400 different species of amphibians, and about 6500 are in the Anura.

There is no fundamental difference between frogs and toads. Frogs have a short body, webbed digits (fingers or toes), protruding eyes, forked tongue and no tail. They are exceptional jumpers: many of their features, particularly their long, powerful legs, are adaptations to improve jumping performance. They often live in semi-aquatic or humid areas.

A popular distinction is often made between frogs and toads on the basis of their appearance. The warty skin of toads is an adaptation for making their toxic slime. Apart from these glands, their skin is dry, and that is an adaptation to drier habitats. These features have evolved a number of times independently: convergent evolution. The distinction has no taxonomic basis: the Anura are not divided into frogs and toads. The only family exclusively given the common name "toad" is the Bufonidae (the "true toads"), but many species from other families are also called "toads".

Frogs have smooth (soft) skin, while toads have rough (hard) skin. Frogs need their skin to be wet in order for them to get oxygen.p6 Frogs and toads have broad heads and plump bodies.p6 They have short fore limbs and long webbed hind feet. This helps them to move and swim in water. They can also use their legs to crawl, hop and leap. Frogs are good jumpers, and some can leap up to six feet in the air. Tree frogs can climb on any surfaces, they use their sticky hands to do this. The tympanum membrane can only be seen on frogs. The tympanum membrane can be found between the frog's ears and eyes. Frogs have tiny teeth inside their mouths. They are found on the lower jaw.p6 The African bullfrog is the only species where the males are longer than the females.p6 Males can reach up to 9½-10 inches in length, while the female only grows up to 4½ inches. Frogs belonging to the suborder Neobatrachia, such as the poison dart frogs and Mantellinae frogs, can kill humans. Like most poisonous animals, they get their toxin from their food.p8

[[Artiodactyl]]

CATEGORIES: Even-toed ungulates

The Artiodactyla are even-toed ungulates, an order of mammals. They have an even number of toes: two or four. For example, camelids or animals of the Giraffidae family have two toes, but hippopotami have four toes.

Whales are ocean creatures without toes, but are classified in the related super-order Cetartiodactyla because their ancestors were even toed ungulates.

[[Odd-toed ungulate]]

CATEGORIES: Odd-toed ungulates

Odd-toed ungulates are the Perissodactyla, an order of mammals. 

Odd-toed ungulates have an uneven number of toes: Horses have only one toe, rhinoceros have three toes, and tapirs have four toes on the front feet and three toes on the hind feet.

Their digestive system is more basic than the even-toed ungulates. A key difference between the two is that odd-toed ungulates digest plant cellulose in their intestines rather than in one or more stomach chambers as the even-toed ungulates do.

Horses, for example, get much less nutrition out of grass than bovines do. This has the consequence that horses have to stop and feed more often, which in turn makes them more liable to predators. However, horses are very well-adapted for running, more so than many oxen or other Artiodactyls.

The living ungulates are a much-reduced group: the horses (including zebras), the tapirs and the rhinoceros.

[[Condor]]

CATEGORIES: Vultures, Ciconiiformes

Condor is the name for two species of New World vultures. Each is the only species in its genus. They are the largest flying land birds in the Western Hemisphere. They are:

Condors are part of the family Cathartidae, whereas the 15 species of Old World vultures are in the family Accipitridae, that also includes falcons, hawks, and eagles. The New World and Old World vultures evolved from different ancestors. 

Condors are scavengers. They feed on carrion (dead animals). Their distinctive bare heads are an adaptation to their feeding method. It helps to keep them clean as they feed inside a carcass.

The Andean Condor has a wingspan of between 274 and 310 cm, and weights around 11–15 kg. The California Condor is smaller.

[[Carrion]]

CATEGORIES: Animals, Death

Carrion is the carcass of a dead animal. There are several kinds of animal that feed on such meat, such as vultures, hyenas, condors, or Tasmanian Devils. Carrion is an important source of food for several kinds of carnivores and omnivores. 

The Carrion beetles also feed on it. Some plants fake the smell of carrion (they smell like carrion), so that they will attract insects they eat. Predators do not normally feed on carrion- they hunt and kill the animals they eat.

Gamal Abdel Nasser Hussein (15 January 1918 – 28 September 1970) was the second President of Egypt from 1956 until his death. Along with Mohamed Naguib, the first President, he led the Egyptian Revolution of 1952 which overthrew the monarchy of Egypt and Sudan, and brought in a new period of change in Egypt. This change made Egypt a more socialist and modern country. In 1954 Naquib resigned as President. Nasser ruled the country, and became President in 1956. He promoted pan-Arab nationalism, including a union with Syria that did not last very long.

Nasser is seen as one of the most important political figures in modern Arab history and politics. Under his leadership, Egypt nationalized the Suez Canal and a lot of other industries, and became important in stopping imperialism in the Arab World and Africa. He was also important in starting the Non-Aligned Movement. Nasser's version of pan-Arabism, which is often called "Nasserism", was very popular in the Arab world during the 1950s and 1960s. Even after the Israeli victory over the Arab armies in the Six-Day War damaged the way the public saw him, many Arabs still view Nasser as a symbol of Arab dignity and freedom.

[[Stork]]

CATEGORIES: Ciconiiformes

Storks are a family of birds (Ciconiidae). They usually live near shallow bodies of water where they wade through the water, and catch small animals, like frogs, crabs, or small fish. Many species of stork are migratory, they spend the summer and the winter in different places. There are 19 different species of stork, in six genera. The marabou stork is the largest species of stork. The Abdim's stork is the smallest species of stork

Probably the best known stork is the white stork. It is known to build large nests in high places. Stork nests are often very large. They may be used for many years. Beforehand, people believed storks were monogamous, that they only had one partner in life. More recent research has shown  that they may change partners. They are attached to a nest almost as much as to a partner.

The marabou stork, which lives in Africa, has a wingspan of up to 320 cm. This makes it the largest bird still alive, together with the Andean condor.

CATEGORIES: Places where alcohol is served, Restaurants

Public houses (better known as pubs) are businesses that serve alcoholic drinks such as beer, cider and ale, and usually also non-alcoholic drinks such as lemonade, cola, tea, and coffee to be consumed within the limits of the public house. They are subject to the licensing laws of the country. They may be closed down if not properly conducted. Many pubs also sell food such as fish and chips and meat pies.

Pubs are found in English-speaking countries such as England, Wales, Ireland, Scotland, Canada, Australia and the United States. In villages and small towns in many parts of England, Wales, Ireland and Scotland, pubs are the centre of community life. Some pubs hire bands or singers to entertain customers. If the pub has rooms where people can sleep at night, it is usually called an inn.

[[Squaring the circle]]

CATEGORIES: Geometry

Squaring the circle is a problem of geometry. The problem is to construct a square that has the same area as the unit circle, only by using a compass and straightedge construction method. Some people also call this problem the quadrature of the circle.

This is not about a circle with corners like a square.  It is a problem like squaring a triangle. It is easy to construct a square with the same area as a triangle. Squaring the circle is related to the other ancient problems which have been proved impossible, squaring the cube and trisecting the angle.

In 1882, Ferdinand von Lindenmann proved that this cannot be done because it is impossible to calculate √π exactly, because it is a transcendental number.

[[Tampa Bay Lightning]]

The Tampa Bay Lightning is an ice hockey team in the National Hockey League (NHL). They were formed in 1991, and began playing in 1992-93 NHL season.

The Lightning has won the Stanley Cup championship twice and won the Division title 4 times (2002-03, 2003-04, 2017-18, and 2018-19). 

Before the Lightning's Stanley Cup championship, the team was regarded as one of the worst team in the league. It made the play-offs once before winning the Southeast Division in 2002-03.  

It won the Stanley Cup championship in 2003-04, the year before the NHL Lock-Out. Under the leadership of captain Dave Andreychuk, and the strong goaltending performance of goaltender Nikolai Khabibulin, the Lightning earned its first Stanley Cup over the Calgary Flames in 7 games.

During the Lightning's Stanley Cup winning year, Martin St. Louis won the Hart Trophy, the league's most valuable player. After game 7 against the Calgary Flames, Brad Richards was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy, the play-offs most valuable player. Also, coach John Tortorella was awarded the Jack Adams Trophy for coach of the year.

Roger Keith "Syd" Barrett (6 January 1946 – 7 July 2006) was an English musician. Barrett is most famous for founding the rock band Pink Floyd. He started the band in 1965 under several different names and wrote the band's first album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn. During this time he experimented with psychedelic (mind-altering) drugs and eventually exited the band in 1968. Following his departure from Pink Floyd, he released two records, The Madcap Laughs and Barrett, to little commercial success, due to the unusual lyrics and unsteady beats. He later suffered from mental health issues, possibly related to his history of drug use. Some of his most successful solo songs are "Dark Globe" and "Octopus".

Barrett was born in Cambridge and died there, of pancreatic cancer.

[[Bovid]]

CATEGORIES: Bovids

Bovids are a family of even-toed ungulate mammals. The word "Bovidae" is comes from Latin bos, "ox". Even-toed ungulates are said to have "cloven hooves": that means their hooves are formed from two toes. They evolved early in the Miocene period.

There 143 living species in this family. They include cattle, goats, sheep and antelopes. The family is widespread, living in all continents except the southern continents South America, Australia and Antarctica.

They are all ruminants, with the double stomach system of digesting vegetation, which is most efficient. The family originated in the Miocene, and is now very successful. Their success is probably helped by their digestive system. The group includes the three domestic animals cows, sheep and goats.

[[Constructed language]]

CATEGORIES: Constructed languages, Language-related lists

An artificial or constructed language (sometimes called a conlang) is a language that has been made by a person or small group, instead of being formed naturally as part of a culture. Some constructed languages are designed for use in human communication (like the common Esperanto). Others are created for use in fiction, linguistic experiments, secret codes, or simply because the maker likes to play language games.

Constructed languages can be split into a priori languages, which are made from scratch, and a posteriori languages, which borrow words and grammar from existing languages.

Constructed languages can also be split into groups by purpose. These groups are:

Some constructed languages also have constructed scripts to write them.

[[Graphical user interfaces and consoles]]

CATEGORIES: Technology

Computers can display information and let the user give commands to it using two methods: a command line interface (CLI) or a graphical user interface (GUI).

In a command line interface, the user types commands using the keyboard to tell the computer to take an action. For example, the more command available in most operating systems will display the contents of a file. Sometimes people call CLI “Console”, but consoles can be GUI, too.

In a graphical user interface, the user can use the computer mouse to click on buttons. For example, your web browser probably has a Print icon to print this page.

Graphical user interfaces are generally thought more easy to use than command lines. Command lines are faster than graphical user interfaces and can be used to give special commands to the computer. It also allows users to run more than one program at the same time.

[[Orchestration]]

CATEGORIES: Music

Orchestration in music can have two meanings:

People who want to compose music for orchestras need to study orchestration.  They can do this by reading books about orchestration, but also they can do this by studying orchestral scores and listening to orchestras in concerts or on CDs.  Students at music colleges will also practise orchestration by taking piano music and arranging it for orchestra.

The word instrumentation means almost the same thing as “orchestration”.  “Instrumentation” means: understanding each instrument and knowing about all the sounds they can make.  It can be about any music with instruments, whereas “orchestration” refers to the orchestra from its beginnings in the 17th century to the present.

Orchestration is all about understanding how to write well for different instruments, how to combine them so that they sound well together and balance well.

Sometimes composers leave the orchestration of their works to other people.  Leonard Bernstein is famous as the composer of West Side Story, but although he composed all the notes he left it to other people to orchestrate.  The composer Maurice Ravel took a piano piece called Pictures at an Exhibition by Modest Mussorgsky (who had died forty years earlier). He arranged it for orchestra.  Most people know this version rather than Mussorgsky’s piano version.

Hector Berlioz and Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov are two famous composers who were particularly brilliant at writing for orchestra.  They both wrote books on orchestration which are still very useful today.

The Battle of the Somme took place in World War I. The battle started on 1 July 1916, and ended on 18 November 1916. The battle was named after the French River Somme where it was fought.

On the first day the British Army had 57,470 casualties, of whom 19,240 were killed. The French Army had 1,590 casualties and the German Army lost 10,000–12,000 men. The Allies planned to attack together, but the French were busy with the Battle of Verdun, so the main attackers were British. The cost of the battle, and the small gains, have been a source of grief and controversy in Britain. In German and French writing, the first day of the Battle of the Somme has been little more than a footnote to the mass losses of 1914–1915 and the Battle of Verdun.

During the battle of the Somme more than 1.5 million people either died, were wounded or went missing. This battle was the worst battle in WWI, especially from the point of view of Britain.

For five days the British fired shells at the German trenches to destroy them. At 7:30 am on 1 July the British generals ordered the British soldiers out of their trenches and to advance towards the German trenches. The German trenches were unusually deep, and the German soldiers were able to take the machine guns down during the bombardment, and bring them up afterwards.

Whole books have been written about this disaster, but it is still not clear why it happened. It is very clear, though, that the artillery barrage failed in its objective. Where enough German machine-gunners survived, supported by their artillery, the British attack failed, with many casualties. The effectiveness of the defensive weapons decided the result. In such an environment, a soldier with a bayonet was obsolete and infantry formations useless.

[[Postulate]]

CATEGORIES: Science, Mathematics

A postulate (also sometimes called an axiom) is a statement that is agreed by everyone to be correct. This is useful for creating proofs in mathematics and science, (also seen in social science)Along with definitions, postulates are often the basic truth of a much larger theory or law. Thus a postulate is a hypothesis advanced as an essential presupposition to a train of reasoning.

Postulates themselves cannot be proven, but since they are usually self-evident, their acceptance is not a problem. Here is a good example of a postulate (given by Euclid in his studies about geometry).

Using this postulate and four others like it, Euclid brought a new understanding of geometry to the world, and many people think they are some of the most influential works in geometry (even in modern time).

Sometimes, postulates are not obviously correct, but are required for their consequences. One example is Albert Einstein's postulate that the universe is homogenous. This type of postulate was necessary to make possible some major scientific achievements, but can also be problematic since it is not self-evident. 

As a rule of thumb, postulates tend to have the following characteristics:

Postulates are sometimes proved to be wrong after they have been known for a long time, but this is usually because something new has been discovered, and the original creator could not have known any better.

[[Influence]]

CATEGORIES: Social sciences, VOA Special English words

Social influence means someone affecting the emotions, opinions, or behaviours of others. It can be either planned for a purpose, or be an unplanned result of other events.

The adjective influential means "having much influence", so influential people or things have the power to change other people or things in some way. This word is often used to describe famous people. For example, Mohandas Gandhi was a very influential person, because the things he did and said changed many peoples lives, and many people believe he has even influenced the world. Kings, clergy and celebrities are also among the influential, as people pay attention to what they say or do. 

Events can also influence. For example, World War II changed many people's lives. They died or became richer or poorer or went to a new place, even after the war ended. When printing became common, it influenced developments in science, politics, religion, and other human activities.

[[Existence]]

CATEGORIES: Basic English 850 words, Philosophical concepts

Existence usually means "the state or fact of being", but there are many different views on the meaning of the word existence, and what it means to exist.

In English, existence is usually connected with the verb "to be".

The first sentence can be understood to say "I exist as a human", and simply speaking, this is probably true. The fourth sentence is more difficult to understand, because it can be understood to say "seven exists as the sum of four and three", but "seven" is not something that we can see or touch like a pen or a human.

The question "What is existence?" is a very important one for philosophers, and many people think Aristotle is the first human being to have thought seriously about the question.

[[Polonaise]]

CATEGORIES: Musical forms, Ballroom dances

The polonaise is a Polish dance.  It started as a folk dance and then became popular among the Polish nobility.  It is in 3/4 time.  It follows a distinctive rhythm as illustrated above. Many polonaises are composed in what is called ternary form, or song form, or minuet and trio. These forms all follow an A-B-A pattern. The music of the A sections is similar in both sections, if not exactly identical. The B section is entirely different. It provides contrast in some way to the A sections.  In the courts of the aristocracy musicians would often play a polonaise from the gallery while the people danced below in the reception hall.

Polish culture was very popular in Europe in the 1830s and so the polonaise became known in other countries.  Composers started to write polonaises for the piano.  Pieces called Polonaise had already been composed by Bach, Handel, François Couperin and others, but it was Frédéric Chopin who in the 19th century wrote several Polonaises for piano which became famous.  Most of them are very difficult to play, especially the famous Polonaise in A flat, Op. 53.  

Several Russian composers wrote polonaises to give a Polish atmosphere, e.g. Tchaikovsky in his ballet The Sleeping Beauty and in his opera Eugene Onegin .

[[Malcolm Arnold]]

CATEGORIES: 1921 births, 2006 deaths, 20th century composers, English composers, People from Northampton, Trumpeters

Sir Malcolm Arnold (born Northampton, 21 October 1921; died 23 September 2006) was an English composer.  He is famous for writing symphonies, concertos and movie music.  People disagree about whether he is one of the really great composers, or just a very skilled musician.  His music is often very tuneful, sometimes it is sentimental.  He could write music very quickly.  His famous music for the movie The Bridge on the River Kwai was composed in ten days.

In 1938 Malcolm Arnold went to the Royal College of Music to study composition with Gordon Jacob.  He started his career as a trumpeter with the London Philharmonic Orchestra, later becoming principal trumpet.  By the late 1940s he was concentrating on his composing career.

Arnold was composing at a time when many composers were writing music which was quite atonal which made it hard to understand, but Arnold’s music is tonal and there are many tunes which are easy to remember.  He wrote nine symphonies and several concertos for different instruments, even unusual instruments like the harmonica.  Some of his best orchestral works are the set of dances: English Dances , Scottish Dances  and  Cornish Dances .  He also wrote 2 operas, 7 ballets and 2 string quartets. His overture Tam O'Shanter is very exciting.  It tells in music the story in the poem by Robert Burns.

Arnold wrote music for 132 films.  The most famous is The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957) for which he won an Oscar.  He was the first British composer ever to have won this award. This movie includes the famous Colonel Bogey March.  This march had been written many years earlier by Kenneth J. Alford, but Arnold composed a countermelody to it.  His original music for the movie includes the famous River Kwai March (this is not the same as the Colonel Bogey March).   Other movies for which he wrote music include The Belles of St Trinian's (1954), The Inn of the Sixth Happiness (1958) and Whistle Down the Wind (1961). 

He was made a CBE in 1970 and was knighted in 1993.

Youth orchestras and amateur orchestras enjoy playing his works because they are an exciting mixture of classical, jazz, popular and folk music, and are not too difficult to play.

Arnold’s health was often very poor. At times he fought with alcoholism and depression, and in his later years with dementia.  He had moved to Dublin in 1972, but moved back to England in 1984 and settled in Attleborough, Norfolk.  His full-time carer Anthony Day helped him a lot during his final years.

Arnold died from a chest infection in September 2006.

The town has about 70,000 inhabitants. Bamberg is an university city and administrative city. Its Lord Mayor is Andreas Starke (SPD). Beside being a modern regional centre, the city also has a cultural and historical side.

Bamberg is a famous town because it has many buildings which are very old. The basic structure of the town remained untouched through the centuries. Unlike most other German towns (such as Nürnberg), it was little damaged in World War II. Only 4.6% was totally ruined. The town centre is protected as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Bamberg is like Rome because it is built on seven hills, each one with a church at the top. The cathedral (Dom) is on the main hill. For hundreds of years the prince-bishops of the cathedral ruled over the land. This continued until the beginning of the 19th century after which they just continued in their religious function as archbishops. 

The town centre below is built by the banks of the river Regnitz which splits into two parts. The left arm of the river is where the old town centre lies. The right arm is the Main-Danube Canal (Main-Donau-Kanal), which allows big ships to travel from the river Main to the Danube.

[[Pulsar]]

CATEGORIES: Variable stars, Astrophysics

Pulsars  are neutron stars which spin rapidly and produce huge electromagnetic radiation along a narrow beam. Neutron stars are very dense, and have short, regular spins. This produces a very precise interval between pulses that range from roughly milliseconds to seconds for an individual pulsar. The pulse can only be seen if the Earth is close enough to the direction of the beam. Similar to how you can only see a lighthouse when the beam is shining at your direction.

The pulses match the star's turns. The spinning causes a lighthouse effect, as the radiation is only seen at short intervals. Werner Becker of the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics recently said,

[[Julius Caesar (play)]]

CATEGORIES: Plays by William Shakespeare

The Tragedy of Julius Caesar is a play by William Shakespeare. It is about the assassination of Julius Caesar in 44 BC.  

Shakespeare based his play on stories in Plutarch's Life of Brutus and Life of Caesar. The play was probably written in 1599. It was first published in 1623 in the First Folio, a collection of all of Shakespeare's plays.

The play was probably one of Shakespeare's first plays to be performed at the Globe Theatre. The theatre had just been built. A Swiss traveller saw a tragedy about Julius Caesar at a London theatre on 21 September 1599. This was probably Shakespeare's play.

The play has been made into movies three times. In a 1950 movie, Charlton Heston played Mark Antony. In a 1953 movie, James Mason played Brutus and Marlon Brando played Antony.  In a 1970 movie, Jason Robards played Brutus, Charlton Heston played Antony again, and John Gielgud played Caesar.

Paul Biya (born Paul Barthélemy Biya'a bi Mvondo; 13 February 1933) is a Cameroonian politician. He is the President of Cameroon. He has been the country's president since 1982.

Biya was born in the village of Mvomeka'a in Cameroon. At that time, the country was called French Cameroon. He studied in France, at the Sorbonne and the Institut d'études politiques de Paris, both in Paris. He graduated in 1961 with a bachelor's degree in public law and a diploma in international relations.

When President Ahidjo resigned on November 6, 1982, Biya became president of the country. Shortly afterwards, Ahidjo and Biya began feuding, and Ahidjo was forced to leave Cameroon.

Biya was elected as the President of Cameroon in 1984, 1988, 1992, 1997 and 2004, but other parties only have been allowed to enter the elections since 1992. The results many of these election results have been called fraudulent (achieved through unfair or illegal ways). 

Many international organizations, including Amnesty International, have criticized Biya's government for restricting the freedom of the people of Cameroon. These issues include control of the media (newspapers and radio and television stations)  and violations of human rights.  Biya's supporters point to the country's stability and high literacy rate.

Biya is currently the longest-ruling non-royal leader in the world and the oldest ruler in Sub-Saharan Africa after Robert Mugabe stepped down during the 2017 Zimbabwean coup d'état.

Kublai Khan became the supreme leader (a title for their leader) of the Mongol Empire and moved his capital to Beijing. He was at war with the southern Chinese Song Dynasty. The Mongol Empire lost some of its battles. The first time it lost a battle with Kublai Khan as the leader was in Palestine when fighting the Mamluks of Egypt. The Empire also lost in the Caucasus. The Mamluks were led by their new sultan Baibars. The Mamluks were soon were more in control in the Middle East because they took control of a number of crusader states and also stopped the Mongol attacks from happening as much. The Empire of Nicaea took control of Constantinople and also the Latin Empire so it again became the Byzantine Empire.

In Europe there was problems in politics. Arguments about who was the owner of what land let to many wars in the continent. In England there was the Second Barons' War. This was a civil war between the aristocracy who did not like how the King named Henry III behaved. This was because the King wanted absolute monarchy. King Otakar II of Bohemia became the most important prince in Europe. He got more land by fighting wars and also when his family died some of their land became his. Iceland and Greenland knew of and recognised the overlordship of Norway but when the Norse invaded Scotland the Scottish were able to stop them and they made peace. In Spain the Reconquista was still happening and several important cities were captured again from the Moors. The way the pope was elected was made better. The parliaments of Ireland and England met for the first time.

Several important cultural achievements were made in the decade. Roger Bacon published important scientific work named Opus Majus. Also, Thomas Aquinas published Summa contra Gentiles. Important pices of architecture and sculptures were made in cathedrals in Europe. These include the Cathedral of Chartres and Nicola Pisano's pulpits for the Duomo di Siena and Pisa's Baptistery. In religion, the Sukhothai kingdom in Thailand adopted Buddhism as its official religion. In Europe anti-Semitism became worse because several authorities made laws which said that Jewish people must wear yellow badges so people knew who they were. Many Jewish people were killed in England and the Talmud was attacked and censored by the Catholic Church.

[[Space-time]]

CATEGORIES: Relativity, Basic physics ideas

Space-time is a mathematical model that joins space and time into a single idea called a continuum. This four-dimensional continuum is known as Minkowski space. 

Combining these two ideas helped cosmology to understand how the universe works on the big level (e.g. galaxies) and small level (e.g. atoms).

In non-relativistic classical mechanics, the use of Euclidean space instead of space-time is good, because time is treated as universal with a constant rate of passage which is independent of the state of motion of an observer. 

But in a relativistic universe, time cannot be separated from the three dimensions of space. This is because the observed rate at which time passes depends on an object's velocity relative to the observer. Also, the strength of any gravitational field slows the passage of time for an object as seen by an observer outside the field.

[[Rabbi]]

CATEGORIES: Rabbis

Rabbi (in the Hebrew classic רִבִּי ribbi; in the Hebrew modern רַבִּי rabbi) in Judaism can mean "professor, master" or literally "grand". The word "Rabbi" ("My Master") derives from the Hebrew root "Rav", that in Biblical Hebrew signifies "grand" or "respected" (in knowledge). 

In Judaism, most rabbis earn their title by studying halakha at a seminary or yeshiva. The primary role of a rabbi is to teach Torah. In addition, rabbis often act as the religious leader of a Jewish community. In contrast to many other religions, a rabbi is not required to be present at life cycle events in Judaism. Nevertheless, rabbis still normally preside over life cycle events in order to ensure that it is done according to Halakha.

"Rabbi" is sometimes used as a title of respect for members of a Jewish community. 

Historically, only men are rabbis. This is true in Orthodox Judaism. Most non-Orthodox Jews allow women to be rabbis.

Three rabbis together can form a rabbinic court, or beit din. This is done when there is a legal conflict between two Jews. They judge the conflict based on halakha. A beit din is also formed for somebody who wants to convert to Judaism.

Rabbis are also sometimes asked to supervise food preparation to make sure it is kosher. When packaged food is supervised, the packaging is often labeled with a hechsher. A hechsher is a symbol which means that the content of the package is kosher.

[[Gentile]]

This is because they would be expected to ask each other over for dinner, but Jews follow strict laws about what they can and cannot eat. They can only eat what is kosher.

[[Hero]]

CATEGORIES: Mythology

A hero (ἣρως) in Greek mythology is a Demigod, a half-god/half-human being.  Herakles, for example, was the son of the god Zeus and the mortal woman Alkmene.  Heroes performed extraordinary feats and were worshipped in hero cults.

The word hero comes from the Greek ἥρως (hērōs), "hero" (literally "protector" or "defender"), particularly one such as Heracles with divine ancestry or later given divine honors.

In the modern world, hero has lost its ancient meaning.  It now means someone who is courageous ("The firefighter who saved my baby is a hero.").  Heroes are "heroic", they have "heroism". They help in saving people or a society from bad people, villains, or natural disasters.  A hero can also be someone who is helpful, polite, or helping people who need it.  The word is used in the sports world to mean an extraordinary player or athlete ("football hero", "Olympic hero", etc.).  The female equivalent of the male hero is the "heroine".

Sometimes, the protagonist (or main character) of a story is called the "hero" of the story.  Some fictional characters are superheroes. 

The opposite of a hero is a villain.

[[Sega Genesis]]

CATEGORIES: Sega video game consoles

The Sega Mega Drive, called the Sega Genesis in North America is a 16-bit video game console made by Sega. It is Sega's third video game console. Sega released it as the Mega Drive in Japan in 1988. In 1989, they released it in North America as the Genesis.

In Japan, the Mega Drive sold poorly against its two main competitors, Nintendo's Super Famicom and NEC's PC Engine. However, it sold well in North America, Brazil, and Europe. Some of the reasons it sold well is because it had many arcade game ports, Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog series, several popular sports franchises, and an aggressive youth marketing that made the system seem like the cool console for teens. Controversy about violent games such as Night Trap and Mortal Kombat led Sega creating the Videogame Rating Council. It was a predecessor to the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB).

30.75 million first-party Genesis consoles were sold around the world. By the mid-2010s, third-party Genesis rereleases were still being sold by AtGames in North America and Europe. Many games have been rereleased in compilations or on online services such as the Nintendo Virtual Console, Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network, and Steam. The Genesis was succeeded in 1994 by the Sega Saturn.

[[Windsurfing]]

CATEGORIES: Surfing, Wind energy

Windsurfing is a water sport invented in the U.K. by Peter Chilvers in 1958 on Hayling Island, Hampshire. It is performed on a board with a sail. The sail both empowers  the board and helps the board change directions. The sport is a combination of surfing and sailing. Windsurfers can travel on either flat or rough water, as long as there is wind. Windsurfing is done mostly in the summer and spring.

Windsurfing competitions can be freestyle or racing around buoys and it features in the Olympics.

Windsurfing sails come in many different sizes. The larger the sails are, the more human strength is needed to control them, but the more power is given to go faster. The different sizes of board affect the speed. Again, the thinner the board, the faster you will go. The range of thickness depends on the materials used. 

Another sport similar to windsurfing is kite surfing.  All these sports have boards that range in size and price, but all need much practice to be done well. There are many sporting places around the world that people travel to just to go surfing. Some of the best places are in the west coast of the United States, Hawaii, Australia, and Indonesia.

[[Thoroughbred]]

CATEGORIES: Horse breeds

Thoroughbred is a breed of horse. They are mainly used for racing. 

Their pedigree is known and recorded. For each horse there is a chart showing its ancestry.

Horses in general have been used for many years, for farm, racing, harness work and so forth.  Horses were the fastest way for people to travel on land before cars were invented. They were the only way to travel long distances in a reasonable amount of time.  

Most horse breeds have been bred for a specific reason; the thoroughbred racehorse was bred to run.  Thoroughbreds originate from the Arabian breed, and all thoroughbreds can be traced back to three original sires (fathers): The Byerley Turk, The Darley Arabian, and The Godolphin Arabian. Thoroughbreds are known for their speed, and also for their jumping ability, used in steeplechases and in show jumping and other horse activities. Although thoroughbreds generally are slightly temperamental, they are very trainable and loyal. 

Thoroughbreds are generally tall and sleek, with long legs to help carry them along the race track.  Thoroughbreds can be many colors, including bay (a colour which is brown with a black mane and tail), chestnut (red-brown), black, and gray. 

[[Sound card]]

CATEGORIES: Computer hardware

A sound card (audio card) is the part of the computer hardware that controls the input and output of the sound signals. A sound card is what is known as an expansion card. This means that the card can be added to the motherboard.

Nowadays, most of the audio cards are integrated with the motherboard. That means they are built into a mainboard and can not be removed. In other words, it is not an expansion card anymore. They only offer line-in, speaker, and microphone connections. For most users this is enough. When thinking of computer architecture, the integrated circuit sound cards occupy less space and thus became very popular and practical, especially for laptop computers. For more features like MIDI ports for connection of musical instruments and low latency requirements (so that the sound does not come distorted under heavy system usage) sound cards as expansion cards can be used. Modern expansion sound cards use the PCI computer bus standard. Earlier sound cards used the ISA computer bus, which was half-duplex, so the sound cards could not record and play simultaneously.

[[Field hockey]]

CATEGORIES: Field hockey, National symbols of Pakistan, National symbols of India

Field Hockey is a well-liked sport for both men and women. It is played in many countries all around the world. In Asian countries like Pakistan and Republic of India, it is considered the "National sport." The game is played between two teams and each team is made up of 11 players. There are four 15-minute quarters with a 15 minute break at halftime and a 2 minute break after the 1st and 3rd quarters. Field hockey is played with a ball on natural grass, or on sand-based or water based artificial turfs with a small hard ball. The field has a goal at each end. A semi-circle about 15 meters from the goal is known as the shooting circle. Goals can only be scored when the ball is in the shooting circle.

Players use a hockey stick to move the ball. The stick is in the shape of a J and is made out of wood, glass and fibre. The players each play a position like fullbacks, halfbacks, forwards and goalkeepers. 

[[Sudoku]]

CATEGORIES: Puzzles

Sudoku (sometimes spelled as Su Doku, but also called Number Place or Nanpure) is a puzzle that is very popular in Japan. It was created in Indianapolis in 1979 by Howard Garns and it appeared in Dell Magazines afterwards.

Sudoku puzzles are solved by logic and no math is required. As seen on the right, it consists of a grid which is usually made up of nine rows, nine columns, and nine boxes that are separated by thicker, darker lines. Some of these boxes will contain numerals from 1 to 9. To solve the puzzle, a person must fill in all the empty squares without using the same numeral twice in each column, row, or box, and without changing the numerals that are already in the grid.

These puzzles were created to be done using pencil and paper, and there are many books that contain collections of these puzzles with tips and strategies for completing them. They also appear in newspapers and magazines: typically, a different puzzle appears every day and the solution is printed somewhere else or in the next issue. Later, small handheld machines were created that generate Sudoku puzzles for the user to solve. More recently, though, the game can be played on the Internet or on mobile apps.

[[High-definition television]]

CATEGORIES: Television technology

January 2012

High-definition television (HDTV) is a new television broadcasting system which uses a higher resolution than a normal television. With HDTV, people can watch television in higher quality than old television, giving a more vivid and clear screen.

Most HDTV systems use digital signals with a 16:9 aspect ratio (width to height). This is different to SDTV (standard-definition television) which uses analog signals and a 4:3 aspect ratio.

HDTV picture resolution is at least twice that of SDTV, so it can present a more vivid screen than analog television or DVD. HDTV can control resolution efficiently.

Some videos on the website YouTube, a free video sharing website that lets people upload and view videos, are in HD.

There are different standards. Common ones are:

As a comparison, PAL plus is at 1024x576 pixels, and NTSC at 853x480 pixels.

[[Guard dog]]

CATEGORIES: Working dogs

A guard dog, sometimes called an attack dog, is a dog that is trained to watch for and guard against people or animals who should not be there. Their main job is to keep their owner and the owner's property safe from danger. A guard dog is not the same as a "watchdog".  A watchdog will let its owner know that a stranger is coming by barking.  Guard dogs, however, may be trained to attack if their owner tells them to. A guard dog may also be trained to attack if a stranger comes too close. If trained properly, they will give a warning before attacking. A different type of guard dog is a livestock guard dog. Certain breeds of dogs are natural guardians of livestock. Their job is to stay with and guard a flock or herd against predators.

SADR was proclaimed by the Polisario Front on February 27, 1976 in Bir Lehlu, Western Sahara. The SADR government currently controls between 20% and 25% of the territory it claims. It calls the territories under its control  the Liberated Territories or Free Zone. Morocco controls and administers the rest of the disputed territory and calls these lands its Southern Provinces. The SADR government considers the Moroccan-held territory occupied territory, while Morocco considers the much smaller SADR held territory to be a buffer zone.

[[Plutonium]]

CATEGORIES: Actinides, Chemical elements, Nuclear physics

Plutonium is the chemical element with the atomic number 94 and chemical symbol Pu.  It is a highly radioactive metal, and is the metal used in most nuclear weapons.  The chemical element plutonium has some different isotopes.  The most important isotope of plutonium is 239Pu (or plutonium-239). It takes 24,110 years for half of a sample of plutonium-239 to decay, which is called its half-life. It can be made from natural uranium.  It is fissile and a nuclear fuel. 

The isotope that has the longest half-life is 244Pu (or plutonium-244). Plutonium-244 has a half-life of about 80 million years. The half-life of 244Pu is long enough that some of this isotope of plutonium is found in very small amounts in nature. 

Plutonium-238 is used in Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators. 

Like other transuranium elements, plutonium can react with water, oxygen, carbon, halogens, nitrogen, and silicon. It forms oxides and hydrides in moist air, causing the plutonium sample to expand by up to 70%. Plutonium from the expanding sample can flake off and catch fire at room temperature. Plutonium is also toxic, although it is less toxic than many people think. The reactivity and toxicity of plutonium make it difficult to handle.

Fresh plutonium has a silvery bright colour but takes on a dull grey, yellow or olive green tarnish when exposed to air.

[[Boron]]

CATEGORIES: Semimetals

Boron is a chemical element. It has the chemical symbol B. It has the atomic number 5. It is a metalloid (it has properties of a metal and a non-metal). Much boron is found in chemical compounds in its ore borax. Boron is never found free in nature. 

Two types of boron are found (allotropes). Amorphous boron is a brown powder and metallic (crystalline) boron is black and hard and a weak conductor at room temperature. Boron is the 5th element in the periodic table it is part of the earths surface

Pure boron is used as a dopant (a substance added to semiconductors to change how it behaves with electricity) in the semiconductor industry. Chemical compounds of boron are important as to make strong materials not weigh very much, as nontoxic insecticides and preservatives, and for chemical synthesis.

Plants need boron in them to live. Very small amounts of boron are needed in animal's bodies so that they are very healthy. How it keeps animals healthy is not known in a lot of detail. 

Boron was discovered by Sir Humphry Davy, an English chemist, in 1808.

Boron melts at 2075 °C (3767 °F), and boils at 4000 °C (7232 °F).

[[Fireplace]]

CATEGORIES: Fire, Home appliances

Emily Dickinson (December 10, 1830 - May 15, 1886) was an American poet who also wrote short stories. She is famous for writing many poems. Researchers know of almost 1,800 poems that she has written to this day. However, she published only a few of them while she was living. Other people changed her unpublished poems before the world could read them. She was born in Amherst, Massachusetts and died of nephritis there. People describe her poems as lyrical and unique. Sources say that she may have grown wild flowers for medicinal purposes and used them to show her mood in her poems.cnToday, many think Emily Dickinson's poetry has had a big effect on poetry.

Researchers know little about Dickinson’s life. Most of what they know about her is from people who knew her and may not all be true.cn Her family had a good amount of money and had many friends. She had a brother and a sister. She had a normal life when she was a child. When she became an adult, she spent more and more time alone and started wearing only white.cn Only after she died all of her poems were published. Until 1955, editors changed them to a style of writing that was popular at the time. Now, most of her poems have been published and can be found at a local library.

[[Skink]]

CATEGORIES: Lizards

Skinks are a family of small lizards, the  Scincidae.  There are over 1,500 different species of skink.

Skinks are different from other lizards. They have very small legs and necks. Some have no legs at all; these move more like snakes than lizards. Their tails can grow back when part of it is cut off. This is called regeneration.

Skinks are small: most can only grow to be 12cm long. Some can grow to be 35cm. A trait  of skinks is a love of digging and burrowing. Underground they are mostly safe from predators. Sometimes they dig tunnels for easy navigation. They also use their tongues to sniff the air and track their prey. When they encounter their prey, they chase it down until they corner it or manage to land a bite and then swallow it whole. Some skinks live in trees. If they do, then they usually have longer fingers.

Many skinks are insectivorous. They may also eat other small invertebrates like earthworms, millipedes, slugs and snails. Some skinks supplement their diet with fruit and vegetables.

Skinks have been around a long time: their jawbones appear in the fossil record about 140 million years ago, during the early Cretaceous. Definitively skink fossils appear later, during the Miocene period.

[[Motor neurone disease]]

CATEGORIES: Diseases

Motor neurone disease (sometimes called Lou Gehrig’s disease or Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) is a chronic, progressive, almost always fatal neurological disease. 

These are the nerve cells which move muscles when we speak, walk, swallow, and move our body. These diseases get worse with time. They cause increasing disability and, eventually, death. There is no known cure.

It is marked by slow but steady death of the nerve cells in the central nervous system that control voluntary muscle movement. That is, people can no longer move, but their heart still beats. 

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common of the five types of motor neuron disease. About 5 to 10% of cases are directly inherited from a person's parents. 

The disorder causes muscle weakness and muscle shrinking (atrophy) throughout the body. Both the upper motor neurons and the lower motor neurons die, making them stop sending messages to the muscles. Unable to function, the muscles gradually weaken and waste away (atrophy). Eventually, the ability of the brain to start and control voluntary movement is lost. However, even patients in later stages of the disease may still have the same intelligence, memory, and personality they had before it started.

[[Fields Medal]]

The Fields Medal is viewed, at least in the media, as the top honor a mathematician can receive. It comes with a monetary award. In 2006 the award was C$15,000 (US$13,400 or €10,550). The Abel Prize has similar prestige, and more money.

[[Laugh]]

CATEGORIES: Human communication

A laugh is a way of showing happiness. It is a  vocal sound which a person makes when something is funny, like a joke, or a tickle.

Sometimes people laugh when they are not happy. When people are ashamed or embarrassed, sometimes they react by laughing.

There are different ways to laugh. A person can laugh using mostly their voice, mostly their throat, or mostly their nose.

You can write a laugh in different ways. Some people write "ha ha ha", or "he he he", or "hehe". If they are on the internet, they also use "LOL". "LOL" does not sound like a laugh, but it stands for Laughing Out Loud.

Human babies first laugh at the age of around three or four months, usually as an expression of surprise. Babies' laughter often produces a positive response in adults who will involuntarily copy the child. Video footage, on the YouTube site, of babies laughing was shown to Queen Elizabeth II during her visit, on 16 October 2008, to the Google headquarters, where both she and her husband the Duke of Edinburgh were reduced to 'fits of giggles'.

[[Bladder]]

CATEGORIES: Anatomy of the urinary system

The urinary bladder is an organ in the human body in charge of storing urine. It is the part of our urinary system. All the liquids that are drunk go through the bladder. The bladder takes in the liquid in order for the body to work. The bladder works with the kidneys. The kidneys clean the liquid we drink. This goes on util the bladder is too full to hold any more. At this point, it is roughly the size of a softball. The bladder then tells the brain that it needs to be emptied. Once this message is received to the brain, the muscles around the bladder start to squeeze and the bladder starts to contract. At the same time the bladder sends a message to the sphincters to relax and let the liquid pass.

[[Time travel]]

Much later, the American movie "Back to the Future" tells a fictional story about a professor who builds a machine that can take people into the future or back in the past. 

The popular British TV program Doctor Who is about an alien who has adventures by time travelling.  Another TV show about time travel is the series Charmed.  Instead of using machines and science, this one uses magic to go to other times and places.  

Some series that are not mainly about time travel have episodes about it, for example Star Trek and Stargate and The Flash.

The Book of Psalms is the first Ketuvim and part of the Hebrew Bible or Tanakh, and it is also in the Old Testament of the Christian translations. People traditionally believe that many of the Psalms in the Bible were written by King David to God. Perhaps the most famous one is Psalm 23, which starts "The LORD is my shepherd". Psalm 23 is often used for funerals.

There are 150 Psalms in the Biblical canon of Jews, Protestants, and Catholics, but there are also more poems that these religions do not think are holy. Psalm 151 is part of canon of the Eastern Orthodox Church.

[[Television program]]

CATEGORIES: Television programs

Television programs (British spelling: programme) are something that people watch on television.  Several different kinds are made: 

Television broadcasting presents many different television programs, one after another. In between television programs, a channel may use an announcer to tell the audience what the next program will be. On many channels in many countries, advertisements are shown for short periods of time during and between program screenings. These advertisements are not a part of the television program.

[[Fatwa]]

CATEGORIES: Islamic law

A fatwa (فتوى; plural fatāwa), is a legal pronouncement in Islam. A mufti (a scholar capable of making judgments on Sharia (Islamic law)) pronounces it. Usually, a fatwa is made to clarify a question where "fiqh" (Islamic jurisprudence) is unclear. Usually a judge or other person requests it.

William Morris "Billy" Hughes (25 September 1862 – 28 October 1952) was the seventh Prime Minister of Australia. He became Prime Minister during World War I. He tried to introduce conscription but the public did not want it. His party, Labor, kicked him out and he formed a new party with the opposition called the Nationalist Party. He was Prime Minister for over 7 years which was the most of anyone at the time. He was forced to resign by the Country Party in 1923 but he stayed in Parliament until he died.

Before serving as Prime Minister, Hughes was Minister for External Affairs under Chris Watson. He was Attorney-General in Andrew Fisher's three Labor governments in 1908–09, 1910–13 and 1914–15.

[[Maid Marian]]

CATEGORIES: Robin Hood, Fictional characters

Maid Marian was the female companion of the outlaw Robin Hood. She appears in English folktales, though not in the oldest ones.

[[Graphite]]

CATEGORIES: Carbon

Graphite, like diamond, is an allotrope of carbon. They are very similar to each other but the different structures of the molecule affect the chemical and physical properties. Graphite is made of layers of carbon atoms. These layers can slide over each other very easily. This means that it is very soft. It is a dull gray in appearance. Due to the delocalized electrons between the layers, it can conduct electricity very well.

Graphite can be formed from coal put under high heat and pressure. Also, graphite can be turned into diamond with enough heat and pressure. This is how synthetic (man-made) diamonds are made.

Most graphite comes from mines in northeastern China. It is also found in Sri Lanka, Canada and the United States. It is also called Lead Black because it looks like the metal lead. It was named by Abraham Gottlob Werner in 1789 originating from the Greek language.

It can be used as a lubricant to make mechanical devices run smoother. The most common use of graphite is the "lead" in a pencil, which also has clay.

High-purity graphite is used as a neutron moderator in some nuclear reactors, such as RBMKs and AGRs.

[[Allotropy]]

CATEGORIES: Chemistry, Physical chemistry

Allotropy (or allotropism) is when a chemical element can exist in two or more different forms in the same physical state or phase. These different forms are called allotropes. Therefore, an allotrope is a different structure in which an element appears. This happens when the atoms of the element are bonded together in a different way.

For example, the allotropes of carbon include:

Only some elements have allotropes. 

The term allotropy is used for elements only, not for compounds. The more general term, used for any crystalline material, is polymorphism. Allotropy refers only to different forms of an element within the same state (i.e., different solid, liquid or gas forms); these different states are not, themselves, considered examples of allotropy.

[[Covalent bond]]

CATEGORIES: Chemical bonding

A covalent bond is a chemical bond between two non-metal atoms. An example is water, where hydrogen (H) and oxygen (O) bond together to make (H2O). A full outer shell usually has eight electrons, or two in the case of hydrogen or helium. Valence electrons are the electrons held comparatively loosely in the outer shell of the atom. The structure of electron shells is determined by quantum mechanics.)

The number of electrons in an atom is decided by the number of protons in the atom. Electrons orbit atomic nuclei, and they are like fuzzy orbital paths around an atomic nucleus. The first layer has up to two electrons. The layers after that usually contain up to eight. Covalent bonds are formed by atoms sharing valence electrons.

If for example, an atom had nine electrons, the first two  orbit very close to the nucleus, the next seven  orbit a little farther away. The outer seven electrons  are less tightly held than the inner two electrons because they are further away from the positively charged nucleus. If this atom gets close to another atom, with a loosely held electron in its outer shell, a new orbital will become available to the loosely held electron. This new electron orbital is bound to both atomic nuclei and has a lower energy level than the original electron orbital. The electron can spontaneously jump to it and emit a photon with the excess energy. Now we have an electron orbiting both atoms which results in the atom that provided the electron having a small net positive charge and the other atom having a small net negative charge. The two atoms are now held together by the electromagnetic force of attraction between positive and negative charges. This is called a covalent bond. To break this bond needs the same amount of energy as was released when it was formed.

A water molecule consists of one oxygen atom and two hydrogen atoms held together by a covalent bond. In this case the oxygen atom shares one electron with each hydrogen atom. This means that the oxygen atoms has a small net positive charge and the hydrogen atom has a small net negative charge. As a result, the oxygen and hydrogen atoms are attracted to each other due to the electromagnetic force. Because of this the water molecule is a polar molecule: its charge is not evenly distributed.

[[Bond]]

Uses of bond, bonds, bonded, and bonding:

[[Ionic bond]]

CATEGORIES: Chemical bonding

An ionic bond is the electrostatic forces of attraction between a non-metal and a metal ion in a giant ionic crystal lattice. This occurs when charged atoms (ions) attract. This happens after a metal atom loses one or more of its electrons to the non-metal atom. The greater the difference in charge between the metal and non-metal ion, the stronger the ionic bond. A maximum of three electrons can be transferred in the process. 

A metal atom becomes a positive cation because it loses electron(s). A non-metal atom becomes a negative anion as it gains electron(s). This occurs, for example, when sodium and chlorine join to form common table salt, NaCl. First, sodium atoms (Na) oxidize and lose an electron to form positively charged sodium ions (Na+). Chlorine atoms gain the electrons from the sodium atoms to form negatively charged chloride ions (Cl-). Both ions are now oppositely charged and they are held by strong electrostatic forces of attraction.

[[Chloride]]

CATEGORIES: Chlorine compounds

Chloride is an ion of chlorine. It occurs when chlorine gets reduced, gaining an electrons and becoming an ion. Chloride is necessary for life. It is normally found in the salt sodium chloride, which is very common in diets.

[[Bauhaus]]

CATEGORIES: Architecture, Art movements, Design, Schools in Germany, World Heritage Sites in Germany

The Bauhaus was a design school that operated from 1919 to 1933 in Germany. It is widely regarded as the most influential art school of the 20th century. It promoted modernism. It is most well known for teaching painting, photography, advertising, weaving, architecture and the design of furniture and household products. The work that it produced and its teaching methods had a world-wide influence on art, design, photography, architecture and art education.

It was formally called the "Staatliches Bauhaus" from 1919 to 1932 because it was state funded in that period. From 1919 to 1925 it was in Weimar, in the state of Thuringia and from 1926 to 1932 it was in Dessau, in the state of Sachsen-Anhalt. It operated as privately funded school in Berlin from the end of 1932 until April 1933. 

Its staff included some of the most famous artists and architects of the 20th century, including: Walter Gropius, who founded the school, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Wassily Kandinsky, Lyonel Feininger, Paul Klee, László Moholy-Nagy, Marcel Breuer, Josef Albers, Anni Albers, Oskar Schlemmer and Hannes Meyer.   

Its former buildings in Weimar and Dessau were jointly made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996.

[[Intelligence]]

CATEGORIES: Intelligence, Basic English 850 words

Intelligence refers to certain mental powers. There is no general agreement on which mental powers are intelligent or part of intelligence. The idea comes from a Latin word: intelligo meaning to choose between different options. A part of intelligence allows people to solve problems. These problems may be easy to solve. They may also be difficult to solve, and involve abstract thought. For some, intelligence is a property, or characteristic of the mind. For others, it is simply the working of the brain, especially the cerebral cortex.

If an answer is found to a problem, it can be remembered. That way, the problem is solved more quickly when it comes up again.  This is what is called learning.

There is disagreement about which has more influence on intelligence, genetics or environment.  Also, intelligent behaviour is possibly learned when an organism (a living thing) reacts enough to a stimulus.

Scientists believe that intelligence can be measured or tested. A type of intelligence test would be solving many problems in a very short time. Most of the problems have to do with seeing things, or telling what a rotated shape would look like. Some are also related to mathematics: for example to tell what number would come next in a row. Other tests have to do with words or the understanding of language.  After giving such a test to a person, a number would be calculated to give an approximation of the Intelligence Quotient (IQ).

Saale is the name of two rivers in Germany: Saale in Thuringia and Saxony-Anhalt (German: Sächsische Saale) and the Saale in Northern Bavaria (German: Fränkische Saale). The larger, and better known Sächsische Saale springs out of the Fichtelgebirge at 728 m and joins the Elbe in Saxony-Asshalt. It is 413 km long.

[[Go Fish]]

CATEGORIES: Card games

Go Fish is a game with playing cards.  2 to 10 people can play.

Every player gets five cards.  The rest of the cards (the deck) are put face down where all the players can get them.  Cards that are the same color and the same number are called pairs.  If a player has a pair, they put it face up in front of them so everybody can see it.  The player to the left of the player who gave everybody their cards goes first.  When it is a player's turn, they ask another player for a card that is the same color and number as one they already have.  They can ask any player.  If the other player has the card, they give it to the one that asked, and the one that asked puts the pair in front of them and gets to go again.  

If the other player does not have the card, then they say, "Go Fish," and the player that asked takes a card from the deck and the next player goes.  If a player has no cards when it is time for him to go, then he just takes a card from the deck and the next player goes.  If there are no cards in the deck and the player has no cards, then that player does not get to go.  The game ends when all the cards are face up in pairs.  The winner is the player with the most pairs.

[[Chicago White Sox]]

CATEGORIES: Chicago White Sox, 1901 establishments in the United States, 1900s establishments in Illinois

The Chicago White Sox are a Major League Baseball team who play on the South Side of Chicago, Illinois. The club is in the Central Division of the American League. They are managed by Rick Renteria since 2017.

The White Sox won the 2005 World Series sweeping the Houston Astros in 4 games.   They won the World Series before in 1906 and 1917 before going into an 88-year championship drought.

The Chicago White Sox finished 2006 with a 90-72 record, four games out of first place after taking two of three from the Minnesota Twins in the final week of the season at the Metrodome in Minneapolis. 

The Sox began major league play in 1901. They took their name from the original name of the Chicago Cubs. The Cubs had first been known as the Chicago White Stockings. By 1901, they were being called the Colts. That allowed the new American League team to adopt the old National League team colors.

The Sox first played at South Side Park. In mid-season 1910, they opened Comiskey Park, which was just a few blocks north of South Side Park. They played at Comiskey for over 80 years. In 1991 they opened a park now known as Guaranteed Rate Field, just across the street to the south of Comiskey Park, and have played their home games there ever since.

[[Pollination]]

CATEGORIES: Plants, Biological reproduction, Coevolution, Bees

Pollination is part of sexual reproduction in plants. It describes how the pollen grains get to the female parts of a plant. Pollen grains, which contain the male gametes, need to get to where the female gamete(s) are.

What happens is basically the same as sexual reproduction in animals. Each pollen grain is haploid: it has half of the DNA (genetic information) that is needed to make a new plant. During fertilization this combines with the DNA that is in the egg of the female part and a zygote is formed. In seed plants a seed is started.

[[Gull]]

CATEGORIES: Charadriiformes, Seabirds

Gulls, also called seagulls, are birds. They form the family Laridae, in the order Charadriiformes.

There are many different types of gull but most of them are white, with grey or black wings, a yellow beak and are about the size of a chicken (but some are smaller). Gulls can eat most types of food but like meat more than anything else. They look around for discarded food and dead animals to eat as well as hunting and have learned how to live and breed in the same places as people. Most types of seagull are awake during the day and sleep at night. They like to sleep on beaches  but will also sleep on water, like lakes or the sea when the water is calm.

Gulls used to be found only near the sea, as they are water birds with webbed feet for swimming. They are more common inland these days because they can find food wherever people live, often on garbage dumps or in the streets of towns and cities. Seagulls are intelligent compared to other birds. They have a complicated system of noises and body movements which they use to communicate with other seagulls.

Most types of seagull breed once a year and have two or three chicks (babies). Mother gulls are very protective of their eggs and chicks and will sometimes fight to the death to defend them.

Gulls are not usually eaten by people.

Coney Island is a peninsula (formerly an island) in Brooklyn, New York. It is famous for its beaches, amusements like the Cyclone wooden roller coaster, Parachute Jump, and Wonder Wheel ferris wheel, boardwalk, and hot dogs. It became a seaside resort in the 19th century. 

It is unsure how Coney Island got its name. It may be because when the Dutch people arrived in New Netherland, this island had many rabbits, so they named it 'Konijn Island', which became 'Coney Island', using the archaic term for rabbit in English. It also may have been named by an Irish pirate, for islands in Sligo bay.

[[Ferris wheel]]

CATEGORIES: Ferris wheels

Ferris wheels (sometimes called big wheels in the United Kingdom ), are large, round, revolving structures with gondolas where people sit. They are popular at amusement parks and fairs. They are named after George Washington Gale Ferris, Jr., who made the first modern wheel for the World's Columbian Exposition in 1893. When he built it, it was 264 feet tall. They called it the "Chicago Wheel" after Chicago, Illinois where it was on display.

[[Four-horned antelope]]

CATEGORIES: Bovines, Mammals of Asia

The four-horned antelope (Tetracerus quadricornis) is a bovine even-toed ungulate. It is also called by its Hindi name chousingha. It is different from other bovines because it has four horns instead of two.

Four-horned antelope are about 0.60 meters high, and they weigh about 20 kilograms. They have a light yellowish-brown fur with a white underside. They have a black stripe down their forelegs. Males have four horns. The back horns are about 10 centimeters long, and the front horns are up to 4 centimeters long.

Four-horned antelope live in India and Nepal. They live in forests. Four-horned antelopes live alone. They eat grass.

Four-horned antelope are hunted by trophy-hunters because of their four horns, but they are also hunted for their meat. Because of the hunting and also because of habitat loss, there are now fewer than 10,000 four-horned antelopes.

Today, four-horned antelope do not live in Africa, but their ancestors probably did.

Stanley Melbourne Bruce (15 April 1883 – 25 August 1967) was the eighth Prime Minister of Australia from February 1923 until October 1929. He became Prime Minister when the Country Party asked Billy Hughes to resign. His government won elections in 1925 and 1928 but lost the 1929 election and Bruce became the first sitting Prime Minister to lose his seat. He was made a Viscount after he left politics.

Bruce was born in Melbourne. He served in the British Army before starting in politics. He fought in World War I, and in 1917 was badly injured while fighting in France. Returning home, he soon became involved in recruiting people for the Army. In 1918, however, he got involved in politics and was elected to the House of Representatives as the member for Flinders, which is near Melbourne. He was appointed Treasurer (finance minister) in 1921.

Bruce was also a diplomat. He served as Minister for External Affairs whilst also serving as Prime Minister. After resigning from Parliament in 1933, he worked in London as Australia's High Commissioner to the United Kingdom.

[[World music]]

CATEGORIES: World music

World music is the recognition of music from around the world. This genre of music is increasingly used in popular culture. World music is often included into mainstream music. World music can also be part of exhibitions, performances, and shows that travel the world. World music is typically music that describes its own origin by its well-known sound features.

In Western countries it may describe a set of (music) market products collected from traditional music or folk music which were found in different parts of the world. In sampled world music collections the music is sung or played by people who traditionally live in the area. World music can be anything from a short song to a long Indian raga. Hindi music is a very popular genre in the category of world music - made even more famous by Bollywood movies.

World music artists can provide accompaniment, feature, background, or lead. World music groups have traveled the world. World music mixing and jamming is a popular activity among musicians. Some genres of world music have become known in a music category of their own. For example, reggae has achieved near to world-wide recognition. 

Some music contests would considered to be world music in foreign audiences. Eurovision has grown in world popularity since it's beginnings. 

Some songs are sung for international use. Each FIFA World Cup has a song.  K'Naan sung a popular song called "Wave your flag" for the tourney in South Africa. These attributed songs have a 'world music' appeal. 

[[Caprinae]]

CATEGORIES: Caprids

Caprinae is a subfamily of the even-toed ungulate family Bovidae. Animals of the Caprinae subfamily are called caprid or goat-antelope.

The domestic sheep (Ovis aries) and domestic goat (Capra hircus) are part of this group.

[[Domestic goat]]

CATEGORIES: Caprids, Domesticated animals

The domestic goat (Capra hircus or Capra aegagrus hircus) is a domesticated mammal. It comes from the wild goat. A male goat is called a buck and a castrated goat is called a wether, a female is called a doe. Young goats are called kids.

People eat their meat, drink their milk, and use their fur and skin. With goat milk, cheese can be made, along with other dairy products like yogurt. Some farmers use goats to eat plants the farmers do not want, such as weeds. Other times, the goats are used to keep grasses and other plants from getting too tall. This also benefits the goat because they get plenty of food to eat. 

The goat has cloven hooves, a long beard on its chin, a short tail that turns up, and horns that grow up from the head in an arc. The hair is straight with a woolly coat under it during winter. Goats have rectangular irises. They are one of the few species to have these unique eyes.

The goat is about 70-120 cm (28-48 inches). They weigh from 45-54 kg (100-120 lb.) during adulthood. 

The diet of the goat includes eating grass, leaves, shrubs, root vegetables, and other kinds of plants. Some ranchers use goats to clear brush and unwanted plants from their pastures. Goats living in the desert, where plants are quite hard to find, have been seen climbing trees to get food.

Goats are smart and active. They enjoy playing with other goats and climbing. They are social animals that may live in groups or herds.

[[Ballroom dance]]

CATEGORIES: Ballroom dances

Ballroom dance is the name for a number of dances done in ballrooms. It usually means pairs (mostly a man and woman) dancing on the same floor as other pairs. The most important difference in style is between the modern or standard dances and the Latin dances. The modern dances are the waltz, quickstep, foxtrot, tango and Viennese waltz. The Latin dances  are the cha-cha-cha, samba, rumba, paso doble, and jive. However, there are also sequence dances, where dancers move together in a pre-set pattern. 

All these dances can be danced socially, more or less any way people want to. As competition dances, they are organised under the rule of the World Dance Council. These competitions are danced in the International style; the techniques were developed by English dancers in the 20th century. All major international competitions are conducted under detailed regulations. There are other systems of dance regulated by national bodies. American style is one; Scottish dancing is another; Greek classical dance is another. 

Although the most famous dancers were Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, they did not dance in ballrooms. Their career together was entirely on film. Astaire danced also on the stage, and on television. The most famous American pair of ballroom dancers was Vernon and Irene Castle, who were national figures until Vernon's death in 1918. Later, Arthur Murray's chain of dance schools taught many Americans to dance. The most famous English ballroom dancer was probably Victor Silvester, who was a professional dancer and a very successful bandleader.

A wormhole is a theoretical passage through space creating a shortcut through time and space. It is not known whether or not they exist.

Scientists believe that if wormholes existed they could not be made following any traditional scientific methods. In order to hold a wormhole open, a form of theoretical exotic matter would be needed. Otherwise the wormhole would simply disappear very quickly after its creation. If plotted on a 2-dimensional plane, the wormhole bends the plane, like folding a paper, so that the two ends would be touching (as seen in the picture). The term wormhole was first used by John Wheeler, a theoretical physicist. It is also known as an Einstein-Rosen bridge. A wormhole is much like a tunnel with two ends each in separate points in space time. Researchers have no observational evidence for wormholes.

Wormholes are a common element in science fiction because they allow rapid interstellar, intergalactic, and sometimes even interuniversal travel. In fiction, wormholes have also served as a method for time travel. This popular fiction allows interstellar travel within human lifetimes. This would allow time travel, also a popular fiction. A proposed time-travel machine using a traversable wormhole would hypothetically work in the following way: One end of the wormhole is accelerated to some significant fraction of the speed of light, perhaps with some advanced propulsion system, and then brought back to the point of origin. Alternatively, another way is to take one entrance of the wormhole and move it to within the gravitational field of an object that has higher gravity than the other entrance, and then return it to a position near the other entrance. For both of these methods, time dilation causes the end of the wormhole that has been moved to have aged less, or become "younger", than the stationary end as seen by an external observer; however, time connects differently through the wormhole than outside it, so that synchronized clocks at either end of the wormhole will always remain synchronized as seen by an observer passing through the wormhole, no matter how the two ends move around.502

[[Free kick]]

CATEGORIES: Football (soccer) terminology

A free kick is a kick awarded to the other team because of a foul, which is committed by another player. Free kicks appear in many different ball sports, like association football.

[[Corner kick]]

CATEGORIES: Football (soccer) terminology

A corner kick is a kick awarded to the team for their opportunity to shoot at goal in soccer. It happens when the ball has come off a footballer at his or her own goal. There are two corner posts at each end of the ground, so two for each team depending where the ball is kicked out.

[[Referee]]

CATEGORIES: Sports occupations, Referees

August 2012

A referee is an official who watches a whole game of sports and makes all the decisions. The players of the sport being watched must always admit that the referee is always right, even if they aren't. Usually, if any player argues, they can get a yellow card or even sent off with a red card. Referees use a whistle so players and fans can hear when play needs to be stopped. Sometimes referees may have Assistant referees to help them just in case they didn't see something or for offsides in Football (soccer).

Referees usually wear clothing to separate them from the players. Most referees wear white and black shirts or an all black uniform. 

[[Cataract]]

CATEGORIES: Diseases and disorders of the eye

A cataract is when the lens of the eye gets cloudy. It is a treatable medical condition. Cataracts can cause short-sightedness (myopia), which means you cannot see things in the distance but can see things up close.

If not fixed by surgery, some types of cataracts will cause blindness (which means you cannot see anything at all). In a simple operation, the old lens can be replaced by a new plastic one. Many thousands of people have had this operation.

[[Goal kick]]

CATEGORIES: Football (soccer) terminology

A goal kick is given when the attacking team puts the ball over the end line in football. The other team then takes the goal kick from the goal areas (six-yard box) and the game starts again. Players of the other team have to stay outside the penalty box during the kick. If the defending team puts the ball over the end line, the referee gives a corner kick instead.

[[The Wiggles]]

CATEGORIES: 2000s Australian television series, Disney Channel shows, Musical groups established in 1991, Children's television series, Children's musical groups, Musical groups from Sydney, English-language television programs

The Wiggles are an Australian children's music group formed in Sydney, New South Wales in 1991. Since 2013, the group members are Anthony Field, Lachlan Gillespie, Simon Pryce, and Emma Watkins. The original members were Field, Phillip Wilcher, Murray Cook, Greg Page, and Jeff Fatt. Wilcher left the group after their first album. Page retired in 2006 due to ill health and was replaced by understudy Sam Moran, but returned in 2012, replacing Moran. At the end of 2012, Page, Cook, and Fatt retired, and were replaced by Gillespie, Pryce, and Watkins. Cook and Fatt retained their shareholding in the group and all three continued to have input into its creative and production aspects.

Field and Fatt were members of the Australian pop band The Cockroaches in the 1980s, and Cook was a member of several bands before meeting Field and Page at Macquarie University, where they were studying to become pre-school teachers. In 1991, Field was inspired to create an album of children's music based upon concepts of early childhood education, and enlisted Cook, Page, and Fatt to assist him. They began touring to promote the album, and became so successful, they quit their teaching jobs to perform full-time. The group augmented their act with animal characters Dorothy the Dinosaur, Henry the Octopus, and Wags the Dog, as well as the character Captain Feathersword, played by Paul Paddick since 1993. They travelled with a small group of dancers, which later grew into a larger troupe. The group's DVDs, CDs, and television programs have been produced independently since their inception. Their high point came in the early 2000s, after they broke into the American market.

The group was formally consolidated in 2005. They were listed at the top of Business Review Weekly's top-earning Australian entertainers four years in a row, and earned A$45 million in 2009. In 2011, the worldwide recession hit the Wiggles, as it had done for many Australian entertainers; they earned $28 million, but they still appeared second on BRW's list that year. The Wiggles have enjoyed almost universal approval throughout their history, and their music has been played in pre-schools all over the world. They have earned multiple Platinum, Double Platinum and Multi-Platinum records; have sold 23 million DVDs and 7 million CDs; and have performed, on average, to one million people per year. The Wiggles' music has also received over one billion streams, and over two billion views on YouTube. The band has also earned multiple Australasian Performing Rights Association (APRA) and Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Music Awards, and been inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame.

The Wiggles released a career-spanning compilation album in March 2021, titled We're All Fruit Salad!: The Wiggles' Greatest Hits.

In the 14th season, Greg Page was replaced by Sam Moran.

[[Patch]]

CATEGORIES: Clothing

A patch is a piece of a flexible material used to repair an object that has a hole in it, to protect an object from damage even before it is damaged, or to decorate clothing or other fabric items.

[[Savanna]]

CATEGORIES: Habitats, Grasslands

The word savanna comes from a Panamanian word for prairie or plains. 

They are covered with tall grasses. They may have scattered bushes and trees, but not enough to keep grasses from growing.  The most common definition of savanna is the tropical grassland, such as in Africa. They have seasonal rains and dry periods.  All savanna plants and trees can survive periods of drought. Most savannas  get enough rain to support the forest, but the forest never happens because something keeps the trees from growing.  This can be animals that graze and knock over trees (like elephants in Africa), or fires that kill most kinds of trees.  Instead there is lots of grasses and other plants that can regrow from the roots.

[[Peasant]]

CATEGORIES: People by wealth or status

A peasant is a name for a person that worked for others on a farm and never had much money. They usually wore rough clothes and lived in small houses.

The word peasant came from the French word for "country" in the medieval era (15th century). In feudalism peasants, like other farmers, had to be able to do a number of jobs on the farm. They lived in rural areas and made up a large amount of the population. Most peasants could not read or write. They did not usually talk with the higher society unless it was about work. Some were serfs meaning they were not free to leave their lord's land.

Male peasants were not the only ones who worked in the fields. Their wives and other woman also worked in the fields if necessary. Female peasants usually did women's work in the house such as cooking, cleaning, making clothes, and looking after children.

[[Racquet]]

CATEGORIES: Sports equipment, Racquet sports

A racquet (sometimes racket) is used in sports to hit an object.  It differs from a paddle because the head is a grid of strings instead of solid.

[[Secondary school]]

CATEGORIES: Types of educational institutions

Secondary school is the next step up from primary school. Secondary schools are often called high schools or middle school in United States. In Britain, secondary schools may be public schools, grammar schools or comprehensive schools.

In Australia, a person will generally begin secondary school when they are at the age of 12 and finish (or graduate) when they are either 16 or 18 years of age. This is dependent upon whether they finish with year levels (or grades) 11 and 12. In secondary school, a person will advance through the year levels (or grades) each year.

In the United Kingdom, a person starts secondary school at the age of 11 and generally finishes secondary at either 16 or 18 depending on whether the secondary school has a sixth form offering post 16 education.

In the United States school system, secondary school is usually divided into two separate schools. One is called middle school and consists grades 6, 7, and 8. And the other is called high school and has grades 9 through 12. A person generally starts middle school at age 11 or 12 and starts high school at age 14 or 15 and finishes at age 18. 

Generally a student goes to the high school for four years. Depending on the laws in each individual state, a student can drop out of high school; the minimum age is 16. If the student does graduate, he/she can plan to continue his/her studies to college or a university, or just join the workforce. 

In some schools in Australia years 11 and 12 are just a normal part of high school. Some other schools may only progress through to year 10; in this case students will then go to college (years 11 and 12).

At the end of secondary school, students will usually take a unified examination. For example, students finishing secondary school in England take the General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE).

[[Cushion]]

CATEGORIES: Basic English 850 words, Furniture, Home

A cushion is a soft bag of material, filled with wool, hair, feathers, or even paper in small pieces . It may be used for sitting on to make a chair or couch more comfortable. Cushions can be used for body support. Cushions and rugs can be used outside, to make hard ground softer. Cushions are often for a decorative purpose and can create more character and appeal to a room. Cushions can come in many different shapes and sizes. However, the most common shape of a cushion is a square or rectangle, like a pillow.

[[Choice]]

CATEGORIES: Social sciences, Causality

A choice is the act of choosing. It is the selection of an optional act, in other words, it has to be an act which allows us a choice. A choice is a decision between alternatives.

We all make choices everyday, from what we are going to have for breakfast to whether we drive or walk to work. 

The field of economics examines how people make choices about how to use scarce resources and goods, such as their money or free time. Some ways of thinking such as existentialism argue that people's choices and decisions are very important.

[[Lutheranism]]

CATEGORIES: Protestantism in Germany, Lutheranism, Martin Luther, Protestant Reformation

Lutheranism is a denomination within the Christian religion.

The namesake who led the Lutherans in their protest against the Roman Catholic Church was Martin Luther. He began this protest against the Catholic Church in the 16th century. Luther was a German priest, theologian, and university professor in Wittenberg. He worked to improve the theology and practices of the Roman Catholic Church, primarily indulgences and abuses of power by the Bishop of Rome. This overall movement is known as the Protestant Reformation.

Lutheranism started when Martin Luther and his followers were excommunicated from the Roman Catholic Church. Luther’s ideas helped begin the Protestant Reformation. Other reformation leaders who separated from the Roman Catholic Church agreed with Luther on some things, but criticized him for not separating himself far enough from Roman Catholic doctrine (see John Calvin and Ulrich Zwingli).

Lutherans believe the Bible is the first and only authoritative source for Christian faith and teaching. Like other Christians, they believe in the Trinity, that Jesus Christ was both God and man, that all humans are sinful since Adam and Eve (see original sin), and that humans are saved by Jesus' death on the cross. Lutherans believe that the central idea to all of their beliefs is that humans are saved by grace alone through faith alone because of Jesus Christ alone (see Justification (theology)). The main points of Lutheran theology were summed up in 1530 by Philip Melanchthon in the writing called The Augsburg Confession.

Similarities with the Roman Catholic faith include (but are not limited to) liturgy, doctrine of the real presence of the Eucharist, baptism, and Original Sin. Unlike Roman Catholicism, Lutheran pastors and bishops are allowed to marry, do not pray for intercession with the saints (including Mary), reject penance as a sacrament, reject the authority (and infallibility) of the Pope or Magisterium, and more.

Major American denominations include the Evangelical Lutheran Church of America (ELCA), the Lutheran Church--Missouri Synod (LCMS), and the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod (WELS), and the North American Lutheran Conference (NALC).

Joseph Aloysius Lyons (15 September 1879 - 7 April 1939) was the tenth Prime Minister of Australia. He was Premier of Tasmania in the 1920s. He was from the Labor party. In 1931 he took his supporters and joined the other side. He started a new party called the United Australia Party. In January 1932 his new party won the elections. Lyons was the first Prime Minister to die while in office.

[[Plow]]

CATEGORIES: Basic English 850 words, Agricultural machinery, Farming tools

A plow or plough is a simple machine used in farming. A plow is pulled across the ground by a human or animal. When pulled across the ground, the plow lifts up dirt and makes two lines of dirt behind it. The dirt lifted by the plow is more loose than before. Ground that has been plowed is a good place for a farmer to grow food.

[[Maglev train]]

CATEGORIES: High-speed trains

Maglev trains  (short form of magnetic levitation) are a very fast type of high-speed rail.  Magnetic levitation is a technology that uses magnetic fields to make the train move. These fields lift the train a small distance above the tracks and move the train. They are much faster than regular trains. A transcontinental "maglev" trip from Toronto to Vancouver might take three hours. This trip takes three days on a regular train. Some day, people may be able to travel faster across land on a "maglev" train than they would in an airliner. The highest known speed of a "maglev" train is 603 This was done in Japan in 2015. As of 2019, a few lines, only a few km or miles long, are carrying passengers in China, South Korea, and Japan.  

A maglev train does not have an engine. The trains are powered by a magnetic field created by the electrified coils in the guideway walls and the track. There are three parts to this system:

With magnets, opposite poles attract and like poles repel each other. This is the basic principle behind electromagnetic propulsion.  Electromagnets are similar to other magnets in that they attract metal objects, but the magnetic pull is temporary and they can be turned on and off and reversed.

The magnetized coil running along the track, called a guideway, repels the large magnets on the train's undercarriage.  This repulsion lifts the train 1 to 10 centimeters ( 0.4 to 4 inches) above the guideway.  Once the train is lifted, power is supplied to the coils within the guideway walls.  This creates a system of magnetic fields that pull and push the train along the guideway.  The alternating current supplied to the coils in the guideway walls is constantly changing the polarity of the magnetized coils.  This change in polarity causes the magnetic field in front of the train to pull the vehicle forward, while the magnetic field behind the train adds more forward thrust.

"Maglev" trains float on a magnetic cushion, which reduces friction.  The trains have an aerodynamic design. This allows them to reach speeds of more than 310 mph (500 kph), or twice as fast as Amtrak's fastest commuter train.  In comparison, an airliner used for long-range flights can reach a top speed of about 560 mph (900 kph). 

Germany and Japan are both developing "maglev" trains, and both are currently testing prototypes. The German company, "Transrapid International", also has a train in commercial use.  Although based on similar ideas, the German and Japanese trains have distinct differences. German engineers have developed an "electromagnetic suspension" (EMS) system, called "Transrapid". In this system, the bottom of the train wraps around a steel guideway. Electromagnets under the train are directed up toward the guideway, which lifts the train about 1/3 of an inch (1 centimeter) above the guideway. This lifts the train even when it's not moving. Other guidance magnets in the train's body keep it stable during travel. The Transrapid maglev train can reach 300 mph (490 kph) with passengers.

[[Lace]]

CATEGORIES: Cloth, Textile arts

Lace is a fabric, patterned with open holes in the work, made by machine or by hand. Lace is very lightweight and open, and the patterns usually have many holes and frills.

Lace is made by knitting, crocheting and weaving.

[[Career]]

CATEGORIES: Occupations

Career has various meanings, mostly having to do with a job. 

The word comes from a French word meaning "road". It came to mean someone's path through life, or through a particular part of life, for example one's time in school. Later many people used the word  only for someone's work and, later yet, a profession, or a job that has an opportunity for advancement. Alternatively, "a career" often means a sequence of related jobs within a single industry or sector, such as "a career in medicine" or "a career in the building trade".

[[Madeline]]

CATEGORIES: Series of books, Children's books, 1939 books

Madeline is a popular children's book series. It was written by American author Ludwig Bemelmans. The first book in the series, Madeline, was published in 1939. The book was very successful. In the 1940s and 1950s, Bemelmans wrote many more sequels to the original. Bemelman’s grandson, John Bemelmans-Mariano, writes the series of books to this day. There are 16 Madeline books. The books were later made into a television series and a movie.

[[Professional]]

CATEGORIES: Occupations

A professional is someone who has a specialised job which only very well trained people can perform, such as  Doctors, lawyers, and teachers. These occupations are known as professional occupations. They may often get paid more than other people. In sport, a professional is someone who is paid to play. For example, Petra Kvitová and Tim Cahil are professional sportspeople.

The word "professional" is often used as an adjective, e.g.

The opposite of "professional" in this sense is: "unprofessional".

Another word that is the opposite of "professional" is "amateur". This means that someone does not get paid for the job he is doing (even if he may be doing it very well).

[[Apartment]]

CATEGORIES: Accommodations

An apartment (US English) or flat (British English) is a place to live that is only part of a larger building. Usually it is a group of rooms on one floor of a highrise building in a city, where land is too expensive for people to have separate houses. An apartment that people own is called a condominium or "condo". A proper apartment has an owner called a landlord who charges money ("rent money" or "rent") from the people who live there ("tenants").

An apartment building or block of flats may have a few or many apartments. Each apartment is a separate room or set of rooms for people to live in. Sometimes an apartment will only be one small room, and tenants will have to share other rooms like the bathroom and kitchen. Other times, tenants will only share an entrance hallway with different doors leading to each apartment. This shared area is often cared for by a janitor or caretaker.

An apartment complex or housing estate is a group of apartment buildings. In an apartment complex, all of the apartment buildings are usually made in a similar way.

In many apartments, the tenants only pay the landlord for renting the apartment, and they have to pay other people to provide utilities like electricity and heat. In some apartments, especially the ones in apartment complexes, the tenants will have to pay more to rent the apartment, but in return the landlord will give them things like utilities, laundry rooms (where people wash their clothing), exercise rooms, and parking spaces for bicycles, motorcycles, and cars.

Apartment buildings are more common in cities than single apartments or houses, because there is less room in a city to fit buildings. Building a house for one family in a dense city would cost an enormous amount of money compared to building a house outside of a city.

They live together in a fictional small town called Stars Hollow, Connecticut. The show aired on television from October 5, 2000 until May 15, 2007. Gilmore Girls was created by Amy Sherman-Palladino. She also acted as the executive producer during the first six series with her husband Daniel Palladino. The show first aired on The WB network and moved to the CW network when the WB merged with UPN.

Gilmore Girls episodes are an hour long. It has very witty storylines that explored family, generational divides, love, and friendship. It has the makings of a comedy because of the fast paced dialogue, the wild references and sense of humour that was in the program. Gilmore Girls is set in Stars Hollow, a fictional town where everyone knew each other and many strange types of people walked the streets.

[[Juice]]

CATEGORIES: Drinks

Juice is a liquid that comes from plants, animals or fruit. The juice from fruit is often made into a drink. Some fruits that are often made into drinks are apple, orange, tomato, pineapple, grapefruit, guava, mango, passionfruit, watermelon, cranberry, grape, lemon and lime, but there are many others. 

In the United Kingdom the name of a fruit or fruits followed by juice can only legally be used to describe something which is 100% fruit juice. This is because of the Fruit Juices and Fruit Nectars (England) Regulations and the Fruit Juices & Fruit Nectars (Scotland) Regulations 2003.

Juice can be bought from a store, already in bottles. Companies sell fruit juice just like any other drink. Juices are made by squeezing the juice out of the fruit.

If something has a lot of juice in it, it is said to be juicy. Juice does not have to be a drink. It can just be a liquid contained in something.

Some Juices could be healthy. Orange juice has vitamin C, folic acid, and potassium which may help prevent various diseases.

[[Disinfectant]]

CATEGORIES: Healthy lifestyle

Disinfectant is a liquid used to destroy and kill unwanted germs and parasites. It is often used in the activity of cleaning, especially in bathrooms and kitchens, as they are the areas most likely to be contaminated with dangerous microorganisms.  Disinfectants are dangerous liquids and should be used carefully because they can be deadly to humans and animals when in large amounts; it is also different to antiseptics for this reason - disinfectants can only be used on non-living things, while antiseptics are not strong enough to combat the germs disinfectant fights. 

Types of Disinfectant

Disinfectant types are classified based on various types of applications. 

Different disinfectants are used differently. 

Four types of disinfectant:

[[Floor]]

CATEGORIES: Basic English 850 words

A floor is a horizontal surface inside a building. People walk on a floor. A floor can be made of many different materials, including concrete, tiling, or wooden floorboards. People often put carpets on a floor. 

The word "floor" can also mean the level in a building. Another word for this is "storey".

The way these levels are numbered may be different in different countries. In Britain and most of Europe, the ground level floors are called the "ground floor", the next level is called the "first floor". In most of the United States, Russia and China, the floor at ground level is called the "first floor", the next level is called the "second floor". This can be confusing for people visiting other countries.

Gymnasts also perform an event on floor. The women perform a routine to music, and the men perform a routine without music. 

[[Okinawa]]

CATEGORIES: Islands of Japan, Ryukyu Islands, Okinawa Prefecture

Okinawa is the name for the biggest island in the Ryūkyū Islands, far south of Japan. It is also the common name for Okinawa Prefecture, which controls the Southern Ryūkyū Islands.

The capital of Okinawa is Naha. Naha is on the island with the most people, Okinawa island. Okinawa used to be called Great Lew Chew Island.

Okinawa is home to the Okinawan people, who also inhabit the minor islands surrounding Okinawa as well. There are also many Japanese in Okinawa.

Many of Okinawa's islands are scenic, and there are many beaches there. 

The temperature in Okinawa is often warm or hot.  Many animals make their home around the Okinawa islands.  For example, sea turtles, jellyfish, and many kinds of birds all live around Okinawa.

An average person in Okinawa lives to be older than 100 years old. Some people think that is because Okinawan food is healthy. Fish is very popular, but people also eat sea vegetables and pork. Okinawans are known as easygoing people, almost everyone loves to sing and dance. Okinawa's music is popular all over Japan.  A musical instrument called a sanshin is often used. They celebrate their musical instrument every year on March 4th by singing folk songs together. Okinawans when compared with Japanese are peaceful people. They placed sanshin on their tokonoma while on Japanese mainland tend to display samurai.

Okinawan food is famous for its originality. Examples of local specialties are Okinawa Soba, Go-ya Champuru, Rafute, and Ji-mami-doufu.

Okinawa was the site of the last big battle of World War II, the Battle of Okinawa. A lot of Okinawan people died during the battle. Now, the United States has some military bases for soldiers on the different islands of Okinawa. There are some symbols of this battle in Okinawa. The Himeyuri Monument is the most famous symbol.

In most countries kindergarten is part of the pre-school system. In North America and some parts of Australia kindergarten is the first year of school. Kindergarten children are usually between three and seven years of age. Kindergarten ages vary from country to country. In Malaysia, for example, kindergarten children are six and when they are seven years old they go to primary school.

The name kindergarten was coined by Friedrich Fröbel (1782–1852). His work influenced early-years education around the world. 

Sometimes, children go to pre-kindergarten for a year, before they go to kindergarten. Pre-kindergarten is more common in United States, Canada, and Turkey than other countries.

[[2006 Atlantic hurricane season]]

CATEGORIES: 2006 Atlantic hurricane season

The 2006 Atlantic hurricane season was an annual event in the yearly cycle of tropical cyclones. It officially started on June 1, 2006, and lasted until November 30, 2006. Ten tropical storms formed during the season. Five became hurricanes, and one tropical storm did not have a name. It Affected USA State Of Florida

This season was unusual in that no hurricanes made landfall in the United States of America. One tropical storm, Tropical Storm Zeta from the 2005 season, continued into January, which was the second time on record that a tropical cyclone existed in two calendar years.

Because of the super-active 2005 season, forecasts and meteorologist thought that the 2006 season would also be very active, but not as active as 2005. However, an El Niño event, combined with the presence of the Saharan Air Layer over the tropical Atlantic Ocean, contributed to a slow season and forcing all tropical cyclones to dissipate after October 2.

[[Ceres (dwarf planet)]]

CATEGORIES: Dwarf planets

Ceres, also known as 1 Ceres, is the smallest dwarf planet in the Solar System and the only one in the main asteroid belt.

It was discovered on 1 January 1801, by Giuseppe Piazzi, and is named after the Roman goddess Ceres, as the goddess of growing plants, the harvest, and of motherly love. After about 200 years from its discovery, the International Astronomical Union decided to upgrade Ceres from an asteroid (or minor planet) to dwarf planetary status in 2006.

With a diameter of about 950 km, Ceres is by far the largest and most massive object in the asteroid belt, and has about a third of the belt's total mass. It was once thought to be smaller than Vesta, which is brighter.  The asteroid is spherical, unlike the irregular shapes of smaller bodies with lower gravity. At its brightest it is still too dim to be seen with the naked eye.

On September 27, 2007, NASA launched the Dawn space probe to explore Ceres and Vesta. In 2015, Dawn became the first spacecraft to visit a dwarf planet, arriving at Ceres a few months before NASA's New Horizons spacecraft visited Pluto, another dwarf planet.

Ceres has an unusual crater, Occator which contains bright salts.

[[Aquarium]]

CATEGORIES: Aquariums

An aquarium (plural aquariums or aquaria) is a place where fish and other animals that live in water are kept by humans. An aquarium can be a small tank, or a large building with one or more large tanks.

Keeping an aquarium is a popular hobby around the world. Careful aquarists (people who keeps aquariums) make sure their fish live in an environment similar to their natural habitats. This means caring about water quality, lighting, and food.

Large public aquariums are often popular with tourists. They show the fish and other animals they keep in large tanks, and also often protect species that are close to extinction. An example of a public aquarium is Sydney Aquarium, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.

[[Logical volume management]]

CATEGORIES: Computer science

Logical volume management is a method of allocating computer storage. It is about allocating space on mass storage devices, like hard drives. It is more flexible than the partitioning of the drive into static (unchangeable) volumes. With a logical volume manager it is possible to grow partitions, even beyond the size of one physical disk. It is also possible to use striping or to put partitions together and combine them while they are being used. 

Logical volume management is a form of virtualisation. It makes it easier to adapt to the changing storage needs of computer users.

== Design == 

Volume managers differ but some basic concepts exist across most versions.  The volume manager starts with physical volumes or PVs, which can be hard disk partitions, RAID devices or SAN LUNs.  PVs are split into small chunks of even size (a default of 4 MB on HP-UX) called physical extents or PEs.  The PEs are then pooled into a volume group or VG.

The pooled PEs can then be concatenated together into virtual disk partitions called logical volumes or LVs.  These LVs behave just like hard disk partitions: mountable file systems can be created on them, or they can be used as raw block devices for swap.

The LVs can be grown by concatenating more PEs from the pool.  Some volume managers allow LV shrinking; some allow online resizing in either direction.  Changing the size of the LV does not necessarily change the size of a filesystem on it; it merely changes the size of its containing space. A file system that can be resized online is recommended because it allows the system to adjust its storage on-the-fly without interrupting applications.

PVs may also be organized into physical volume groups or PVGs. This allows LVs to be mirrored by pairing together its PEs with redundant ones on a different PVG, so that the failure of one PVG will still leave at least one complete copy of the LV online. In practice, PVGs are usually chosen so that their PVs are on different sets of disks and/or data buses for maximum redundancy.

Some volume managers also implement snapshotting by applying copy-on-write (COW) to each PE.  In this scheme, the volume manager will copy a PE to a COW table just before it is written to.  This preserves an old version of the LE—the snapshot—which can later be reconstructed by overlaying the copy-on-write table on the current LE.  Snapshots which are read-write are branching snapshots because they implicitly allow diverging versions of an LE.

Snapshots can be useful for backing up self-consistent versions of volatile data like table files from a busy database, or for rolling back large changes in one swoop, such as an operating system upgrade.  Some Linux-based LiveCD systems also use snapshots to simulate read-write access on a read-only compact disc.

[[Soapstone]]

CATEGORIES: Metamorphic rocks

Soapstone or steatite is a metamorphic rock.  It has a large amount of the mineral talc.

Steatite is softer than most stones.  Because steatite feels like soap, people call it "soapstone".  People have been making things out of soapstone for thousands of years.

Soapstone has been a major component of ceramics used as electrical component insulators for many years. It is easily formed or carved into shapes.

During the Harappan/Indus civilization (2500 BC1750 BC) soapstone was used in the manufacture of seals. These people used to import steatite from Shaher-i-sokhta and the Kirthar hills.

[[Treaty of Tordesillas]]

CATEGORIES: 15th century in Spain, History of South America, Treaties, 1494, History of Portugal

The Treaty of Tordesillas was a treaty between Portugal and Spain in 1494 in which they decided to divide up all the land in the Americas between the two of them, no matter who was already living there. Pope Alexander VI, who was Spanish, was the Pope at the time of the treaty. The Pope drew an imaginary line on a map 2,193 kilometers to the west of the Cape Verde Islands, gave Portugal the land to the east of this line, and gave Spain the land to the west of this line. King Ferdinand II of Aragon and Queen Isabella of Castile were the rulers of Spain at the time and together they signed this treaty in Tordesillas, Spain, which is how the treaty got its name. This also changed Spanish and Portuguese exploration of the New World, which in part explains why the Portuguese-speaking part of South America became one country called Brazil and the Spanish-speaking colonies split up into many different independent countries including Argentina, Colombia, and many others.This treaty took place during the age of discovery and was one a very important part of it.   

This was the justification of Spain for occupying the French colony of Port St Louis established on the Falklands Islands in 1764, saying it was on their side of the world.   

Spain governed the territories West of the line and Portugal governed the territories east of the line.

After Great Britain (1600) and the Netherlands (1602) joined the Portuguese and Spanish in exploring the world at the beginning of the 17th century, the Treaty was breached and more or less 'cancelled'. By this time, Portugal's limited resources had already reduced its ability to hold its Asian colonies and trade superiority. In time, the French, Danes, Swedes and eventually the Americans joined the earlier Europeans in looking to have a presence in South and East Asia.

[[Jam]]

CATEGORIES: Spreads

Jam is a condiment. It is usually made from pressed fruit, sugar, and sometimes pectin. Most jams are cooked. After making, jam is normally put into an airtight jar.

Usually a jam contains as much sugar as it contains fruit. The two parts are then cooked together to form a gel.

In the European Union, the jam directive (Council Directive 79/693/EEC, 24 July 1979) sets minimum standards for the amount of "fruit" in jam.  It also expanded the definition of fruit.  This was done to take several unusual kinds of jam made in the EU into account.  For this purpose, "fruit" is considered to include fruits that are not usually treated as fruits, such as tomatoes; fruits that are not normally made into jams, such as melons and watermelons; and vegetables that are sometimes made into jams, such as: rhubarb (the edible part of the stalks), carrots, sweet potatoes, cucumbers, and pumpkins.  This definition continues to apply in a later directive, Council Directive 2001/113/EC (20 December 2001).

According to Canadian food and drug regulation (CRC), jam and jam products must at least have 45% of the named fruit and 66% of water-soluble solids. In addition, it may contain added pectin, pectinous preparation, or acid ingredient. Also, reasonable amount of a Class II preservative, a pH adjusting agent, and an antifoaming agent is acceptable. However, the jam product shall not contain apple or rhubarb.

Marmalade is jam made from oranges and tends to have pulp and peels.

Jelly is different from jam as it is made from mostly juice instead of fruit.

Fruit butters are made from slow cooking fruit to a smooth consistency.

Joan Miró used blackberry jam as an art medium.

As a gel, jam is neither a solid or a liquid. It can contain chunks of fruit which are solids. Once opened and out of the fridge the gel becomes more like a liquid, and is able to decay.

CATEGORIES: German composers, Romantic composers, Music critics, 1810 births, 1856 deaths

Robert Schumann (b. Zwickau in Saxony, June 8, 1810; died July 29, 1856) was a famous German composer. He lived in the time called the Romantic period. He had to give up his plans for being a concert pianist because he injured his hand. He published a music magazine and wrote a lot of articles about music that had just been composed. His music is full of things that are typical of Romantic music: it is full of emotion, the pieces often have titles that describe things, and they are often inspired by literature. He wrote a great deal of piano music. Some of this music is hard to play, but other pieces are quite easy. Many children learn to play some of the pieces in his Album for the Young. His songs (Lieder) are among the best ever written. He also wrote larger works like symphonies and concertos and chamber music. Sometimes he felt very happy but at other times he was very depressed. These changes of mood can be heard in a lot of his music.

[[Clara Schumann]]

CATEGORIES: German composers, Romantic composers, Women composers, German pianists, 1819 births, 1896 deaths

Clara Schumann (born Leipzig 13 September, 1819; died Frankfurt am Main 20 May, 1896), was the wife of composer Robert Schumann. She was a famous pianist and composer.

Clara was born Clara Wieck. Her father taught her the piano. She was a prodigy and by the time she was thirteen her father was taking her on concert tours.

She was only nine years old when Robert Schumann came to Leipzig to study law at the university. Robert Schumann’s family had told him that he had to study law, but he wanted to be a musician. He took piano lessons from Clara’s father, Friedrich Wieck.

Clara not only learned the piano, she also studied singing, the violin, instrumentation, score reading, counterpoint and composition. By 1835 she was famous in the whole of Europe and was admired by Goethe, Mendelssohn, Chopin, Paganini and, of course, Robert Schumann.

Clara’s father did not want them to marry. He did everything he could to stop the marriage. For several years life was very difficult for them, but in the end, by 1840, they were married.they married by court permission

They had a happy marriage and had eight children. Clara played her husband’s piano works (Schumann had a hand injury and had to stop playing the piano). She ran the household and earned money by teaching and performing. Life was not always easy. When they went on tours together Clara was more famous than her husband, and this was difficult for him. Robert often had depression. They both taught at the Leipzig Conservatorium and Clara also taught privately in Dresden and Düsseldorf.

Robert Schumann died in 1856 after two years in a mental asylum. Clara was left with seven small children to bring up. Nevertheless, she continued her career as a pianist and often travelled to other countries, especially England, where she played Robert’s piano works. She was great friends with Brahms and often performed his works, too.

Clara’s own compositions are all from her early years. She was a very gifted composer. In those days people thought that women should not be composers. Playing the piano was one thing, but a woman was not expected to be a professional composer. Clara knew this, and devoted more time to her playing, and to editing her husband’s music.

Clara’s compositions include more than 20 piano works, a piano concerto, some chamber music and several songs.

The theory of relativity was developed by Albert Einstein in the early 1900s. There are two theories of relativity. The first is special relativity and the second is general relativity. 

The theory aims to solve problems which could not be solved by classical physics, or by 19th century physics. Certain observations, like the orbit of Mercury or the way light from distant sources bends as it passes a star, cannot be explained by the physics of 1900. Einstein set out to revise the basic ideas of physics. His work was done in two stages, and each stage has a separate page on this wiki.

[[BIOS]]

CATEGORIES: Software

BIOS, computing, stands for Basic Input/Output System. The BIOS is a computer program embedded on a chip on a computer's motherboard that recognizes and controls various devices that make up the computer. The purpose of the BIOS is to make sure all the things plugged into the computer can work properly. It brings life to the computer, and the term is a pun on the Greek word βίος, bios meaning "life".

"Booting", sometimes called "Booting up" is the process that the computer completes to get it ready to use when it is first turned on. When the computer turns on, the BIOS starts up and performs a Power-On Self Test (POST). During the POST, the BIOS will check various devices in the computer like the computer processor, memory, the video card and others to make sure they are present and functioning. Once the POST has completed successfully, the BIOS looks for an operating system to load, which is usually located on the computer's hard drive. When it finds one, it starts to load it. At this point, the operating system takes over control of the system.

Francis Michael Forde (18 July 1890 – 28 January 1983) was the 15th Prime Minister of Australia. He was Prime Minister for only a week after John Curtin died. He lost a leadership contest to Ben Chifley. He was prime minister for only eight days, less than any other Prime Minister from Australia. He also lived longer than any other Prime Minister, until Gough Whitlam, who passed Forde's age on January 21, 2009. He died at 92 years old.

Forde was from the Australian Labor Party. He was the Minister for Trade and Customs in the Scullin government (1929–1931). When Scullin retired in 1935, Forde tried to become the leader of the Labor Party, but he lost by one vote to John Curtin. When Labor won the 1941 elections and Curtin became Prime Minister, Forde was made Minister for the Army. On 5 July 1945 Curtin died; because he was Deputy Leader, Forde was then made Prime Minister until the Labor Party chose a new leader. At the leadership election on 13 July, Ben Chifley was voted leader, and Forde was made Deputy Leader again.

[[Biosphere]]

CATEGORIES: Ecology

The biosphere includes everything living on Earth it is also known as ecosphere. Currently the biosphere has a biomass (or amount of living things) at around 1900 gigatonnes of carbon. It is not certain exactly how thick the biosphere is, though scientists predict that it is around 12,500 meters. The biosphere extends to the upper areas of the atmosphere, including birds and insects.

In a general sense, biospheres are any closed, self-regulating systems containing ecosystems. This includes artificial biospheres such as Biosphere 2 and BIOS-3, and potentially ones on other planets or moons.

[[Drum and bugle corps]]

CATEGORIES: Music, Military

A drum and bugle corps is similar to a marching band but it only has brass instruments, percussion instruments, and color guards. Armies used signal drums and bugles as signals for centuries. The modern drum and bugle corps came from military drum and bugle units coming back from World War I and the wars after it. Early drum and bugle corps was a year-round activity, where musicians performed at shows all the time. Now, most drum and bugle corps schedule tours during the summer, where they travel around the country, performing a new show every year, with different music and movements.

[[Piccolo]]

CATEGORIES: Flutes

The piccolo is a small flute that plays one octave higher than the normal flute.  It sounds an octave higher than written.  It is the highest instrument in the orchestra. Sometimes it sounds like a birdcall. The name 'piccolo' comes from the Italian word meaning 'small'.

[[Double reed]]

CATEGORIES: Double reed instruments, Musical instrument construction

Double reeds are a group of musical instruments in the woodwind family. Instead of a mouthpiece, the player blows air through a pair of reeds that vibrate against each other. 

Examples of double reed woodwinds are the bassoon, oboe and Cor anglais (English horn).

[[Alto flute]]

CATEGORIES: Flutes

The alto flute is a flute that plays a fourth (half an octave) lower than the regular flute.  It is longer than the regular flute.  Sometimes alto flutes have a bent part at the top end.

The alto flute is a transposing instrument.  This makes it easy for someone who plays the flute to play on the alto flute.  The fingering for the note C on the flute will give a G on the alto flute.

The alto flute is not very often used, and only in very large orchestras.  Maurice Ravel wrote a beautiful tune for alto flute in Daphnis et Chloé.  Igor Stravinsky used one in The Rite of Spring.  In The Planets by Gustav Holst there is a passage with three flutes and alto flute playing 4 part harmony.

The alto flute must not be confused with a bass flute which is even bigger and lower and very unusual indeed.

[[Travelling salesman problem]]

CATEGORIES: Theoretical computer science, Combinatorial optimization

The Traveling Salesman Problem (often called TSP) is a classic algorithmic problem in the field of computer science and operations research.  It is focused on optimization. In this context, better solution often means a solution that is cheaper, shorter, or faster. TSP is a mathematical problem. It is most easily expressed as a graph describing the locations of a set of nodes.

thumb|William Rowan HamiltonThe traveling salesman problem was defined in the 1800s by the Irish mathematician W. R. Hamilton and by the British mathematician Thomas Kirkman. Hamilton’s Icosian Game was a recreational puzzle based on finding a Hamiltonian cycle. The general form of the TSP appears to have been first studied by mathematicians during the 1930s in Vienna and at Harvard, notably by Karl Menger. Menger defines the problem, considers the obvious brute-force algorithm, and observes the non-optimality of the nearest neighbour heuristic:We denote by messenger problem (since in practice this question should be solved by each postman, anyway also by many travelers) the task to find, for ﬁnitely many points whose pairwise distances are known, the shortest route connecting the points. Of course, this problem is solvable by finitely many trials. Rules which would push the number of trials below the number of permutations of the given points, are not known. The rule that one first should go from the starting point to the closest point, then to the point closest to this, etc., in general does not yield the shortest route.Hassler Whitney at Princeton University introduced the name traveling salesman problem soon after.

[[Creditor]]

CATEGORIES: Economics

A creditor is a person who loans money to another person. The person who gets the loan is called the borrower. Creditors are sometimes called moneylenders. Creditors expect the borrower to pay the money back at a later time. The creditor usually gets extra money from the borrower. This extra money is called interest.

[[Anno Domini]]

CATEGORIES: Time, Chronology

Anno Domini (Medieval Latin : "in the year of the Lord"), shortened as AD or A.D., is used to refer to the years after the birth of Jesus. AD is also a shortening for Christian Era. Similarly, Before Christ, shortened as BC or B.C., is used in the English language to refer to all years before the start of the time period Anno Domini.  In past centuries, AD came before the year but comes after a century or millennium.  For example, a person would write AD 2014 but 21st century AD or 3rd millennium AD.  There is no zero year in this system.  This means that the year A.D. 1 follows the year 1 B.C.

Some people mistakenly interpret “A.D.” as standing for “after death.”  The abbreviation “A.D.” was originally placed before the year number (e.g. A.D. 145); then “B.C.” often placed after the year number (e.g. 145 B.C.).  Nowadays it is more usual to put both abbreviations after the numbers (e.g. 145 AD; e.g. 145 BC).

This dating system was meant to signal the year of Christ's birth, but modern scholars have decided Jesus was actually born a few years earlier.

[[Haze]]
