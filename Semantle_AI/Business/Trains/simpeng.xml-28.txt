[[Doom 3]]

CATEGORIES: Doom series, Video game sequels

Doom 3 (or Doom III in roman numerals), is a sequel to the first-person shooter game Doom 2. It was created by iD Software, and came out in 2004. It was the first to not be based on the same game engine as Doom and Doom 2, and had 40 levels. Even though the game is named Doom 3, the game is not a direct sequel, which means the story does not take place after Doom or Doom 2. In fact, it is a reboot of the first Doom, which means it is a new start to the Doom story. Doom 3 has a very dark environment, and the player carries a flashlight to light the way, although the flashlight can't be used at the same time as the weapons. However, this feature changed the BFG Edition, where the player does not carry the flashlight like a weapon, but the player can use at any time during gameplay. That being said, the player must be careful not to use the flashlight too long, because the flashlight will automatically turn off after it runs after battery, and the player must wait for the battery to recharge before using the flashlight again. The game had two expansions, Resurrection of Evil and Lost Mission.

[[Popularity]]

CATEGORIES: Society

Popularity is the state of being well-liked or well-known. People, things, and ideas can be popular. Popularity figures are an important part of many people's personal value systems, and forms a critical part of success in fields such as management, politics, and the entertainment industry, among others.

Many different varieties of popularity exist, and many ways in which to gain it. General popularity usually involves respect in two ways: a popular person is respected by groups of people and will take that respect. This reinforces the idea that the person deserves the popularity. Likewise, amicability (friendliness) is an important part of popularity, as a person who does not like others is unlikely to be liked by others. This inverse nature of interpersonal popularity is often overlooked by people (particularly the young) who are attempting to become popular: being loud may be successful in gaining attention, but is unlikely to provide mutual respect.

[[Prime mover (locomotive)]]

[[Argument from design]]

CATEGORIES: Intelligent design, Philosophy

The argument from design is an argument for the existence of God or a creator. According to the argument, the appearance of design in nature is evidence for the existence of God. The argument is teleological, because it assumes a purpose. The word "teleological" comes from the Ancient Greek telos, which means "end" or "purpose".

Teleology assumes there is purpose or direction in the works and processes of nature. Immanuel Kant called this argument the physico–theological proof.

[[Na'vi]]

CATEGORIES: Fictional races

The Na'vi are a fictional indigenous species that live on the fictional world of Pandora in the movie Avatar. They look like humans. They have two eyes, ears, arms, and legs. They also have a nose, a mouth, and expressions that are similar to humans. The Na'vi are different because they have blue skin, pointed ears, huge eyes, and tails.  They are also taller than humans. They have a smaller body frame. At the beginning, the Na'vi were meant to be more alien in their looks. Director James Cameron said that in the first drawing of the main character, "Neytiri", she had fins, gills, and cat-like features. The species was changed to look more like humans. This was so audiences could relate (feel closer and empathise) to them better. Cameron said that Avatar was more "science fantasy" than true science fiction. He said that he would explain in the novel why the Na'vi look like humans.

According to Entertainment Weekly, "The Na'vi can commune with animals on their planet by literally plugging their ponytails into the creatures' nerve systems. To become a warrior, a Na'vi must tame and ride a creature known as Ikran." The Na'vi also use this system to mate with a "life partner". They make a bond that cannot be broken in the Na'vi's lifetime.

The Na'vi language is a constructed language. It was made for the movie to be spoken by the actors when they played Na'vi characters. The Na'vi language was made by linguistics professor Paul Former of the University of Southern California. Frommer made the language so it could be spoken by human actors. It uses syntax and grammar from real languages. The professor made up over 1,000 words for the Na'vi language. He taught the actors who played Na'vi characters to speak it for the movie.

[[Renault F1]]

CATEGORIES: Renault, Formula One constructors, Formula One current, Formula One engine manufacturers, Formula One, 1977 establishments in the United Kingdom

Renault F1 is a Formula One racing team. It was once owned by the Renault company. In December of 2010, Renault sold their remaining part of the Formula One team. Renault has a long history in F1. Ferenc Szisz won the first French Grand Prix at the wheel of a Renault. Since then Renault has competed in Formula One as an engine supplier and as a builder from the late 1970s to the present day, with many breaks. Renault introduced the turbo engine to Formula One when they debuted their first car, the Renault RS01 at Silverstone in 1977. Although the Renault team won races and competed for world titles, it was as a supplier of engines to the Benetton and Williams teams in the 1990s that Renault first tasted world championship success. Renault Engines powered drivers such as Nigel Mansall, Damon Hill, Jacque Villeneuve and Michael Schumacer to the Drivers World Championship. 

Renault returned to the job of being a builder in 2001 by taking over the Benetton team, which was renamed Renault in 2002. Their first championship as a builder was achieved in 2005; the same year that they won their first drivers' championship with former test driver Fernando Alonso. They repeated their success in the following year. 

The teams lowest point so far was in late 2009. at the end of the 2008 season the team saw a brief return to the podium spots, with Fernando Alonso winning 2 of the last 4 races. However, Nelson Piquet Jnr, Who had drove for Renualt throughout the 2008 season (but was sacked from the team) told the media that the team had made him cheat in order to help Alonso win.

At the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix (the first ever Grand Prix to be held at night) Nelson Piquet Jnr lost control of his car at the outside of Turn 17, sliding across the road and smashing into a wall, throwing lots of debris across the road, meaning the Safety Car had to be called out to lead the cars through the track slowly to protect the Marshalls cleaning the road. This closed the gaps between the cars, meaning they were now racing very close together. This allowed Fernando Alonso, who was in 15th place to pass the slower less experienced drivers around him. Alonso went on to win race. 

After Renualt fired Piquet Jnr for his poor driving in 2009, He told the FIA (the organisation that run the Formula 1 World Championship) That Flavio Briatore, the Boss of the Renualt F1 Team (Who had been the boss for 20 years, and had cheated previously) had told him over the radio to crash the car deliberately, in order to bring the safety car out and give Alonso a better chance. Alonso was not aware of this at the time, or before to the crash.

Following a meeting of the FIA Super Council in Paris, Team Principle Flavio Briatore and Chief Engineer Pat Symmonds were found guilty. Both had to leave the team and Flavio was banned from Formula 1 for life (That band has now been lifted). In connection with the event, Renault F1's main Sponsor ING Insurance (as shown in the photo above) Also left the team

On 8 December, 2010, Renault announced that they had sold their remaining ownership shares in the team to Genii Capital, a private investment group. Those shares will be purchased by  Lotus Cars, which is owned by Proton. Proton owns Lotus Cars. The team will be named Lotus Renault GP for 2011. They will continue to use Renault as the chassis name. The cars will use a black and gold livery (paint scheme). It will be similar to the historic John Player Special sponsorship that Lotus had in the 1970s and 1980s.

The team has raced as a French team since Renault took over Benetton in 2002. In January 2011, it was announced that they will race under a British licence in 2011. This is the first time since 1975 that there has not been a French team in Formula One.

[[Coconut milk]]

CATEGORIES: Plant milks, Coconuts

Coconut milk is a sweet, milky white liquid for cooking. It comes from the meat of a mature coconut. The color and rich taste of the milk are because of the high oil content and sugars. It is different from coconut water (coconut juice), which is the natural liquid found inside a coconut. Coconut milk is used in many tropical recipes. There are two kinds of coconut milk: thick and thin. 

Milk is what female mammals make to feed their babies. Coconut milk can therefore not be called milk in the strict sense of the term.

[[Mojito]]

CATEGORIES: Alcoholic drink

A mojito is a kind of cocktail. It is from Cuba originally. It is made of rum, sugar, lime juice, sparkling water and mint. It usually contains about 10 percent alcohol. The combination of sweetness, sour citrus and mint flavour is intended to complement the rum. It is popular drink in hot weather.

When making a mojito, lime juice is added to sugar and mint leaves. The mixture is then gently mashed together. The mint leaves should only be bruised to release the essential oils; they should not be torn apart. Then rum is added. The mixture is then stirred to dissolve the sugar. Finally, ice cubes and sparkling water are added in the top of the drink. Mint leaves and lime wedges are used to garnish the glass.

There are several stories about how the mojito was invented. One story says that it is similar to a 19th-century drink called "El Draque", after Francis Drake. This drink is said to have been given to the crew of Drake's ships when they came to Cuba in the 16th century. Many in the crew were suffering from dysentery and scurvy. They were told that the Native Americans had remedies for various tropical illnesses. They went ashore on Cuba and were given ingredients for a remedy: a kind of rum, lime, sugarcane syrup and mint. While this drink was not called a mojito at this time, it is the same combination of these ingredients.

[[Edmontosaurus]]

CATEGORIES: Hadrosauridae

Edmontosaurus was a large, plant-eating, duck-billed dinosaur from the latest Cretaceous stage. It had short arms, a long, pointed tail, three-toed, hoofed feet, and mitten-like hands. Its head was flat and sloping with a wide, toothless beak, cheek pouches, and hundreds of closely-packed cheek teeth that ground up its food. It is the same animal as Anatotitan. There are two species, and the animal has been called by several other names in the past.

Edmontosaurus was named from a fossil found in the  Horseshoe Canyon Formation, in Alberta, Canada. Many Edmontosaurus fossils have been found, in Alberta, and Alaska, Wyoming, Montana and New Jersey in the USA. Two mummified Edmontosaurus fossils were found in Wyoming.

The distribution of its fossils suggests that it preferred coasts and coastal plains. It could move on two legs and on four. Because it is known from several bone beds, Edmontosaurus is thought to have lived in groups. It may have been migratory.

[[Ornitholestes]]

[[Liverwort]]

CATEGORIES: Botany, Bryophytes, Non-vascular plants

The liverworts are a group of simple plants. Scientists believe that liverworts were the first bryophyte to evolve. They believe that mosses, hornworts, and more complex plants then evolved from liverworts. Scientists decided this from mitochondrial DNA.p75

Liverworts are usually placed in the bryophytes, a group of plants without tissue to conduct water. That is why they always need to live near a spring, a river, or in a place where there is a lot of fog or has a lot of rainfall. This group also includes with mosses and hornworts. Recent taxonomy gave them their own division called the Marchantiophyta. However, since the classification is not yet settled, we use the old terms.

Liverworts, as the picture shows, are small plants with flattened bodies, or with flattened stems bearing overlapping scales.p135

The name liverwort comes from the Middle Ages, when plants were selected as medicines according to the false belief that similia similibus curentur (similar heals similar). The liver-shaped seen in the liverwort Marchantia , for example , was  boiled in wine as a medicine against liver problems. The name was then transferred to the whole group.

[[Planck length]]

CATEGORIES: Nuclear physics, Units of length

The Planck length (ℓP) is a very small unit of length. It is calculated from three physical constants: the speed of light, the Planck constant, and the gravitational constant. 

It is about 1.616255 or about 10−20 times the size of a proton. It is one of the Planck units, defined by Max Planck. It is an important length for quantum gravity because it may be the size of the smallest black holes.

[[Seed dispersal]]

CATEGORIES: Plants

Seed dispersal is the way seeds get away from the parent plant to a new place. "Dispersal" means  to spread or scatter. The basic idea is as follows. Plants, obviously, cannot move after they have put down roots. It follows that it is an evolutionary advantage to get their seeds away from the parent plant. If the seeds take root nearby they will compete with each other and the parent plant. Also, a species is more likely to survive when its members are widely spread. This is because local disasters still leave plants in other places.

From the first land plants in the Silurian period for 300 million years to the Lower Cretaceous, virtually all transport of spores and seeds was done by mechanical means. In fact, for most types of plants both fertilisation and dispersal was done by wind. If not wind, then water was the medium. A great change took place with the appearance of flowering plants in the Cretaceous.

The story of flowers and insects is one of the best examples of co-evolution. The gut contents, wing structures, and mouthparts of fossilized beetles and flies suggest that they acted as early pollinators. The association between beetles and angiosperms during the Lower Cretaceous period led to parallel radiations of angiosperms and insects in the Upper Cretaceous. The evolution of  in Upper Cretaceous flowers signals the beginning of the mutualism between hymenopterans and angiosperms.

What is true of fertilisation is also true of dispersal. Spores, the tiny products of lower plants, are almost always dispersed by wind. So are many seeds. Some seeds, and their later development, fruits, are obviously "adaptations" to a world full of animals. If they are dispersed by being eaten, it is advantageous for them to be nutritious and good to eat. So spores, seeds and fruits may get dispersed mechanicallly or by animals:

[[Route availability]]

CATEGORIES: British Rail

Route Availability (RA) is the system by which the permanent way and supporting works (bridges, embankments, etc.) of the National Rail network of Great Britain are graded. All routes are given an RA number between 1 and 10.

Rolling stock is also given an RA (again between 1 and 10) and the RA of a train is the highest RA of any of the supporting elements. The RA is mainly about the axle load of the vehicle, although axle spacing is also taken into thought. In practice it is the locomotive which decides where trains may operate, although many high capacity four axle wagons have high RAs when fully loaded. (When considering the operation of trains the loading gauge must also be considered.)

They attended after President Eisenhower sent the United States Army to let them in.  This is thought to be one of the most important events in the Civil Rights Movement. 

[[Hornwort]]

CATEGORIES: Bryophytes, Plant taxonomy, Non-vascular plants

Hornworts are a type of bryophytes. They are non-vascular plants which do not have tissue that moves water. The name "hornwort" come from the horn-like structure that grows on these plants. This structure is the sporophyte. The flattened, green part of a hornwort is the gametophyte.

Like all bryophytes, hornworts have alternation of generations. In this cycle, the plant has two forms: the haploid gametophyte and diploid sporophyte. The gametophyte is the green plant body that you most often see. The sporophyte is the "horn" that sheds spores.

Hornworts grow all over the world. They grow well where it is damp or humid. Some species grow in large numbers as tiny weeds in the soil of gardens and cultivated fields. Some tropical species may be found growing on tree bark.

The taxonomy of bryophytes is being debated. Some think the hornworts should be placed in a separate division, the Anthocerotophyta.

[[European honey bee]]

CATEGORIES: Bees

The European honey bee or western honey bee (Apis mellifera) is the main species of honey bee. The genus Apis is Latin for "bee", and mellifera comes from Greek melli- meaning "honey" and ferre "to bear". So, the scientific name means "honey-bearing bee". In 1758 Carolus Linnaeus named the bees as Apis mellifera. However, he later found out that bees do not bear honey, but they actually bear nectar. Because of this, he tried to change it to Apis mellifica ("honey-making bee") later.

Workers do a waggle dance in the beehive to tell the others where they have found nectar; Karl von Frisch discovered this.

The merger was approved in September 2010, and the parent company changed its name to United Continental Holdings when United completed its acquisition of Continental.  The combined airline takes the United Airlines name but uses Continental's globe and livery.  There has been negative reaction to the new livery, many of whom were in favor of keeping the iconic "tulip" logo, designed by Saul Bass in 1973.

Continental operated flights to destinations throughout the U.S., Canada, Latin America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific regions.

[[Mississippian (geology)]]

CATEGORIES: Carboniferous

The Mississippian is the first geological epoch in the Carboniferous geological period. It began about 359 million years ago and ended 323.

The names Mississippian and Pennsylvanian are used in North America, because they match the strata there. Geologists from elsewhere mostly use just 'Carboniferous', or they use the official terms for stages, as defined by the International Commission for Stratigraphy. 

During the Mississippian the sea level was high, and much of North America was covered by a shallow sea. The strata are mostly layers of marine limestones.

[[Pennsylvanian]]

CATEGORIES: Carboniferous

The Pennsylvanian is the Upper Carboniferous epoch in the strata of North America. It comes after (above) the Mississippian, and before the Permian. The Pennsylvanian started about 323 million years ago (mya), and ended about 299 mya.

The coal measures, which give the Carboniferous its name, are the remains of peat formed by dense tropical wetland forests. They were formed in the Pennsylvanian, from about 315–300 million years years ago.

These forests were on the equator, and the wetlands, which are always low-lying, stretched from North America in the west, through what is now Europe to China in the east, because these continents were all together at the time (Laurussia). The river plain which was the heart of the wetland stretched 5000km from eastern Canada to the Ukraine, and was 700km wide.p6 This would make the Pennsylvanian basin larger than any wetlands on Earth today.

The characteristic vertebrates of the coal measures were amphibia, and the plants were mostly giant clubmosses such as Lepidodendron.

[[Anthozoa]]

CATEGORIES: Cnidarians

Anthozoa are a class in the phylum Cnidaria. It includes the sea anemones and the corals. It is a monophyletic clade, one of two in the Cnidaria. The other is the Medusozoa.

The class does not have a medusa larval stage in its development, unlike the rest of the phylum. Like all Cnidaria, their food-catching and defense are done by nematocysts, which are extremely effective stinging cells. Over 6,100 species have been described.

There are three subclasses:

[[Cnida]]

CATEGORIES: Cnidarians, Animal anatomy

The cnida is the basic term for the stinging apparatus of the phylum Cnidaria. The whole life-style of the phylum is based on this device, which enables the animals to catch their prey. The cnida appears in several forms: the most usual is the nematocyst. 

Cnidae are organelle-like capsules with eversible tubules (they shoot the tubule outwards). They are the diagnostic feature of the phylum. All cnidarians possess cnidae; no loss of the feature is known.

There are three main types of cnidae: nematocysts, ptychocysts, and spirocysts, with many variations. Depending on the species, one or more types may be on the organism.

The cell which produces the cnida is variously called a cnidocyte, cnidoblast, or nematocyte. It is highly specialised for just one function. Each nematocyte cell contains an organelle with a hollow, coiled, thread-like structure. The outside of the cell has a hair-like trigger. When the trigger is touched, the shaft of the cnidocyst fires like a harpoon. It penetrates the prey, and the hollow thread comes with it. This takes no more than a few microseconds. After penetration, the toxic content of the nematocyst is injected into the target. The rapid activity of the injected neurotoxins paralyzes the mobile prey, thus allowing the sessile cnidarian to devour it.

[[Goldenrod]]

[[Brunswick, New York]]

CATEGORIES: Towns in New York

Brunswick is a town in Rensselaer County, New York, United States that was first settled in the early 1700s. During its history, it had been part of Albany County, Rensselaerswyck, and Troy, before its incorporation in 1807. It is bordered on the west by the city of Troy; on the north by Schaghticoke and Pittstown; on the east by Grafton; and on the south by Poestenkill and North Greenbush. The number of people living there was 11,664 at the 2000 census. The story of the town's name is fought: some say it comes from the source of its first people who lived in Germany, Brunswick-Lüneburg, while others say that it honors the "Duke of Brunswick (George I).

The town was in the past agricultural, but began experiencing suburban sprawl in the later decades of the 20th century, which continues today. Historically, most of the developments have happened around the town's two major crowded roads: New York Route 7 and New York Route 2, known locally as Hoosick Road and Brunswick Road. Brunswick became a popular place to settle in upon the completion of the local highway system in the Capital District, mostly the fix of Route 7 into a four-lane highway in the 1980s.

Or, between the result of a sporting event and a discussion of how and why the result happened.

[[Red-tailed hawk]]

CATEGORIES: Accipitriformes

The red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis) is a buzzard. Sometimes it is called a chickenhawk,  though it does not normally eat chickens. It is a bird of prey. It breeds throughout most of North America, from western Alaska and northern Canada and as far south as Panama and the West Indies. It weighs from 1.5 to 3.5 and its wingspan goes from 43 to 57.

The red-tailed hawk is a carnivore and eats shrews and mice. They have keen eyesight to see even the smallest mouse scamper across a field. It can swoop down at least 80mph per hour. It will pick up its prey, dig its talons into its body and kill it and eat. It can swoop down so fast that it can pick up its prey in less than 5 seconds.

Because they are so common and easily trained, most hawks got for falconry in the United States are red-tails. Falconers may take only 'passage hawks' (which have left the nest, are on their own, but are less than a year old). This is so not to affect the breeding population. Adults, which may be breeding or rearing chicks, may not be taken for falconry purposes and it is illegal to do so. 

Passage red-tailed hawks are also preferred by falconers because these younger birds have not yet developed adult behaviors, which would make training much more difficult.

[[Sauropelta]]

CATEGORIES: Ankylosauria

Sauropelta was an armoured dinosaur from the Lower Cretaceous. It looked a lot like its more advanced relative Ankylosaurus, but didn't have the bony nodes at the end of its tail. 

Anatomically, Sauropelta is one of the best-understood nodosaurids, with fossilized remains recovered in the U.S. states of Wyoming, Montana, and possibly Utah. It is also the earliest known genus of nodosaurid; most of its remains date to about 115 to 110 million years ago.

It was a medium-sized nodosaurid, measuring about 5 meters (16.5 ft) long. Sauropelta had a distinctively long tail which made up about half of its body length. Although its body was smaller than a modern black rhinoceros, Sauropelta was about the same mass, weighing in at about 1,500 kilograms (3,300 lb). The extra weight was largely due to its extensive armour, including the large spines projecting from its neck.

As in other ankylosaurs, thick triangular scutes projected above and behind the eyes, as well as below and behind the eyes. More typically for nodosaurids, leaf-shaped teeth lined both upper and lower jaws, used for cutting plant material. The front end of the skull is unknown, but there would have been a keratinous beak.

[[Ouranosaurus]]

CATEGORIES: Dinosaurs of Africa, Cretaceous dinosaurs, Ornithopods

Ouranosaurus was a sail-backed, plant-eating, iguanodontid dinosaur from the Lower Cretaceous period. It was about 24 feet (7 m) long and may have weighed about 4 tons.

Spinosaurus, a large, sail-backed meat-eater, was one of its contemporaries in the hot, Cretaceous environment of north Africa. Ouranosaurus was named by the French paleontologist Phillippe Taquet in 1976.

[[Scyphozoa]]

CATEGORIES: Jellyfish

The Scyphozoa is a class of the phylum Cnidaria, sometimes referred to as the "true jellyfish". There are 200 species. The name Scyphozoa comes from a Greek word which refers to the cup shape of the jellyfish.

The medusa form is the dominant life form, as opposed to the polyp. They eat plankton, small crustaceans and fish larvae, which they capture using stinging cells called nematocysts. The nematocysts are attached to the tentacles that hang down from the edge of the umbrella dome. Scyphozoans have an internal jelly-like material. They have no hard parts, no head, and no specialized organs for respiration or excretion. 

Unlike other types of jellyfish, scyphozoans lack a velum, a circular membrane which propels other jellyfish through the water. Scyphozoans move through the water by contracting and relaxing the muscles of their umbrella.

[[Box jellyfish]]

CATEGORIES: Cnidarians

The Cubozoa, the box jellies, contain some of the most dangerous jellyfish in the phylum Cnidaria. They make up a small class of Cnidarians, with only 19 species. It is their powerful venom which makes them noteworthy.

All cubozoans have four 'legs' (pedalia) hanging from the corners, from which hang tentacles. They have a rudimentary neural network. The cubozoans can move through the water to actively hunt prey, and have a degree of sight as they have up to 24 eyes. Cubozoans have two main eyes on each of the four pedalia, each with a lens, retina and cornea; and some species also have eye-spots as well. 

The box jellies are found in tropical oceanic waters round the world. Their venom is delivered by stinging nematocysts, which cluster on tentacles, each with half a million stinging cells. The largest species, Chironex fleckeri, has caused many human deaths. The pain of an attack is agonising, and heart failure is a danger. The attack can be treated: first with vinegar, then remove stingers, then apply anti-venom.

[[Milkweed butterfly]]

CATEGORIES: Danainae

The Danainae is a subfamily of butterflies. It belongs in the family Nymphalidae. There are over 200 species. They are commonly known as Milkweed butterflies or danaids.

These butterflies are common in tropical places all over the world. One of the most famous butterflies, the Monarch (Danaus plexippus), belongs in this subfamily. The larvae and the butterflies get poisonous glycosides from their larval host plant, the milkweed, so they become distasteful to predators. These milkweed butterflies (Monarch, Queen, Soldier) eat only milkweeds (Asclepias) as larvae. This highly effective defence strategy shields them against almost all predators. Birds soon learn to avoid these species after attempting to eat them.

Males in this subfamily have anal hairs. This body part at the end of the abdomen can be pulled back inside the body. They also have spots on the bottom wings that release scents to attract females. The male raises his abdomen and puts his hair pencils into the androconia. After the hairs have the chemical on them, the male will use them during courtship.

[[Map lichen]]

CATEGORIES: Fungi

The map lichen is a species of lichen, Rhizocarpon geographicum. It grows on rocks in areas of low air pollution. Each lichen is a flat patch bordered by a black line of spores. These patches grow next to each other. This makes the lichen look like a map or a patchwork field.

Map lichen is a lichen widely used by climatologists to determine  the relative age of deposits. As an example, they might use it in  a moraine systems, to tell how long a rock has been exposed. With this they can also tell about glacial advances. The process is called lichenometry.

Lichenometry is based on the assumption that the largest lichen growing on a rock is the oldest individual. If the growth rate is known, the maximum lichen size will give a minimum age for when this rock was deposited. 

Growth rates for different areas and species can be obtained by measuring maximum lichen sizes on substrates of known age, such as gravestones, historic or prehistoric rock buildings, or moraines of known age (e.g. those deposited during the Little Ice Age).

[[Thought disorder]]

CATEGORIES: Symptoms

In psychiatry, the term thought disorder or formal thought disorder refers to a condition where people have problems with consistent and straight thinking leading to abnormalities e.g. with spoken and written language. The people who have this condition use language that is disordered, or sometimes hard to follow. According to the psychiatrists, language is a reflection of thought processes. People who have difficulty speaking therefore often also have difficulty thinking.

Thought disorder is considered to be a symptom of psychotic mental illness, but there can also be other causes for it.

The condition it describes is permanent. It affects speech and writing. Those affected may speak all the time, or they may show patterns like switching ideas inside a sentence. They may also use different words that do not fit together at all; this is known as 'word salad'.

Eugen Bleuler, who named schizophrenia, held that its defining characteristic was a disorder of the thinking process. However, although the delusions and hallucinations of psychosis could also be considered as disorders of thought, the term formal thought disorder applies specifically to the presumed disruption in the flow of conscious verbal thought that is inferred from spoken language. This is typically what is referred to when the strictly less accurate, more commonly used but abbreviated term, 'thought disorder', is used.

[[Dunkirk evacuation]]

CATEGORIES: World War II, May 1940 events, June 1940 events, 1940 in France

The Dunkirk evacuation sometimes called Operation Dynamo or The Miracle of Dunkirk was a British mission to rescue Allied soldiers from the beaches of Dunkirk France, from 26 May to 4 June 1940. Over 300,000 Allied soldiers were trapped in Dunkirk by the German army after the Battle of Dunkirk. For some reason, the German commanders did not order an attack against the surrounded city. Winston Churchill then ordered all  ships and boats available to head for Dunkirk to pick up the soldiers.

Over 900 ships participated in the evacuation, consisting mostly of fishing and pleasure boats, although some larger ships also took part. Originally, their intention was to pick up 40,000 British soldiers, and it was anticipated the Germans would try to stop them. On the first day, only 8,000 soldiers were picked up from the harbour, but none from the beach. On the second day, 17,000 soldiers were evacuated including some from the beaches. On the third day, 47,000 soldiers were successfully rescued followed by 54,000 on day four, including the first French soldiers. Evacuation reached its peak on days five and six, when over 60,000 Allied soldiers escaped. By day seven, nearly all the British had left, but the boats continued to pick up 26,000 soldiers a day (nearly all French). Evacuation ended after nine days, by which time 200,000 British soldiers and 140,000 French soldiers had escaped to Great Britain.

The battle of Dunkirk was a great defeat for the British and Allied forces, but most of the British Army in France and part of the French Army escaped to fight again. They lost almost all their tanks, big guns, and other heavy equipment.

[[Foster care]]

CATEGORIES: Children, Law

Foster care is a term used to describe when a child is living and looked after by a family which is not their own.  The child may be put into foster care because their own parents are not able to look after them.  When it comes to making sure that your foster child feels welcomed into their new home, you would need to do more than just open the front door for them. Welcoming a foster child into your home is like a balancing act. 

There may be several reasons why this may happen.  The parents may be very ill or unable to control their own lives, perhaps because of alcoholism or drug addiction.  They may be in prison or the children may be threatened with violence in their own home.  Children are put into foster care so that they are safe and can live a more normal life in someone else's home.

When a child is fostered there has to be a legal agreement.  The person who looks after them instead of their own parents is called a “foster parent”.  The child is made a “ward” of court, which means that power is given through the court of law to the foster parent to look after them.  The foster parent(s) is “in loco parentis”, meaning: “in the place of the parent”.  They can make decisions about the child because the real parent(s) are not able to do this.

The laws about fostering children are, of course, not the same in different countries around the world.

In most Western countries fostering can sometimes be a long-term arrangement, perhaps until the child has become an adult.  However, in many cases the child may be able to return to their own family later if their family life has changed.

Foster parents are paid by the state to look after the children.

Adoption is different from foster care.  Adoption is taking into one's family (a child of other parents), especially by a formal legal act.

Fosterage is not the same as foster care. Some societies have arrangements whereby children are brought up in other families. This is a social matter, not a legal matter.  This can be described as "fosterage".

[[Fosterage]]

CATEGORIES: Children, Anthropology

Fosterage is an arrangement in which a child is brought up with a family that is not their own.  It is different from foster care, which is a legal arrangement made for a child's safety.  Fosterage can describe many different arrangements according to the society they belong to.  In many parts of the world there are societies where the children do not live with their parents.  This may be linked to the society's special way of life.

[[Custody]]

Custody can refer to:

[[Child custody]]

CATEGORIES: Childhood, Family law

Child custody and guardianship are legal terms which are sometimes used to describe the legal relationship between a parent and his or her child.  It includes such things as the right of the parent to make decisions for the child, and the parent's duty to care for the child.

Child custody decisions have to be made in cases such as divorce, or when a child cannot be looked after by either parent and has to be put into foster care or put up for adoption. 

In general: decisions about who will have custody of a child will be taken in such a way as is best for the child.

A child may be given state custody.  This may be because the child is in danger when living at home.  There may, for example, be violence in the home.

When there is a divorce case, a decision will be made about whether the mother or the father has custody of the child.  There may be "joint custody", which means that both parents have custody over the child.

Physical custody means: who looks after the child from day to day.  It is about where a child will live.  

Legal custody means: having the power to make decisions about the child, e.g. where he or she goes to school etc.

If a child lives with one parent, that parent has "sole physical custody".  He or she is the "custodial parent".  The other parent is the "non-custodial parent", but they may have the right to visit the child.

The laws about child custody will vary from one country to another.

[[Backward compatibility]]

CATEGORIES: Computers

Backward compatibility refers to hardware or software that can successfully use interfaces and data from earlier versions of the system or with other systems. For example, Perl, the scripting language, was designed to be backward compatible with awk, an earlier language that Perl was designed to replace.

Backward compatibility is more easily accomplished if the previous versions have been designed to be forward compatible, or extensible, with built-in features such as hooks, plug-in, or an application program interface (API) that allows the addition of new features.

The term backward combatible (notice the "b") is sometimes used to describe hardware or software that is designed without regard for compatibility with earlier versions, causing the two versions to fight (or combat) each other. In this case, the two versions cannot share data easily and may have features that cause errors or crashes when they are installed on the same computer, often because the computer does not understand which version is being referred to. Even if the earlier version is removed, remaining vestiges of it may cause problems in running the newer version.

[[Manchester code]]

CATEGORIES: Telecommunications, Encodings

The Manchester code is a binary encoding which also encodes the clock signal. This is very useful, because an external clock signal is no longer needed. A sequence of bits modulates the phase of the signal. This is a form of Phase shift keying, often shortened to PSK.

Otherwise put, the information about the signal is in its signal flanks, that is when the signal changes.

Manchester codes are widely used, for example for Ethernet or for RFID. 

[[Roger Waters]]

CATEGORIES: 1943 births, Living people, BAFTA Award winners, Bassists, English activists, English rock musicians, English singer-songwriters, Musicians from Cambridge, Musicians from Surrey, Pink Floyd

George Roger Waters (born 6 September 1943) is an English rock musician. He was born in Great Bookham, Surrey and moved to Cambridge during his early childhood. He is best known as the bass player, co-lead singer, principle lyricist, and founder member of the English rock band Pink Floyd (1964–1986). Waters became the primary lyrical contributor in Pink Floyd after the departure of fellow founder member Syd Barrett in January 1968, and sang lead vocals on at least one half of all Pink Floyd tracks during his tenure with the band. Many consider 1973–1979 to be the Golden Age of the Waters era Pink Floyd, during which time they released four studio albums, including two of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed rock albums ever created.

Released in 1973, The Dark Side of the Moon is one of the top selling albums of all time. Pink Floyd followed the epochal success of Dark Side with Wish You Were Here (1975), Animals (1977) and  1979's The Wall, a double album considered by many to be rock's finest. The Wall, based on the life struggles of Roger Waters, is the best selling double disk of all time, and as Pink Floyd's second unequivocally definitive album, it solidified their status among the world's elite rock bands.  In 1983 Pink Floyd released their tenth studio album, The Final Cut.  Written and almost entirely sung by Roger, (Gilmour sang on just one track), it is the only Pink Floyd album on which Waters is credited for the writing and composition of every song. In retrospect, The Final Cut is more fairly considered Roger's first solo album, essentially using David Gilmour and Nick Mason as studio musicians. One of rock music's most critically acclaimed and commercially successful acts, Pink Floyd has sold over 200 million albums worldwide, including 74.5 million in the United States.

Following his legal and philosophical split with Pink Floyd in 1986, Waters began a solo career, releasing three studio albums, The Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking (1984), Radio K.A.O.S.  (1987), and in 1992, the highly acclaimed Amused to Death. In 1990, Roger staged one of the largest rock concerts ever, The Wall Concert in Berlin, on the vacant terrain between Potsdamer Platz and the Brandenburg Gate. In 2005 he released the critically acclaimed opera, Ça Ira, which would go on to top the classical charts in America and Britain, as well as joining Nick Mason, Richard Wright and David Gilmour, for an historical performance at the 2 July 2005 Live 8 concert in London's Hyde Park, Pink Floyd's first public performance with Roger in 24 years.

Waters has toured extensively as a solo act since 2005, performing Dark Side to sold out audiences and critical acclaim the world over. Waters performed an extensive tour of The Wall between 2010 and 2013.

[[Big Max]]

CATEGORIES: Cucurbitaceae

Big Max is a type of squash that can grow to be more than 100 pounds. They can also be 20 in diameter if they are grown properly. They are commonly called pumpkins, but this is not entirely correct; Big Max are instead "squash-type pumpkins". They have a bright orange color, with fine-grained, yellow-orange flesh. The skin has deep lines in it and is slightly roughened, and can be up to 3 thick. This makes Big Max squash good for keeping. The flesh is good for being canned and frozen.

However, because they are so big, cooking with these squash is hard. They are said to not be as flavorful as smaller pumpkin varieties. The variety was hybridized, or created, for its large size. They have been grown as big as 300 pounds. Individual fruits are round to slightly flattened.

[[Hazel dormouse]]

CATEGORIES: Dormice, Mammals of Asia, Mammals of Europe, Mammals of Great Britain

The hazel dormouse (Muscardinus avellanarius), also known as the common dormouse, is a small rodent. It is the only living species in its genus.

It is 6 long with a tail of 5.7. It weighs 17, increasing to 30 just before hibernation. The hazel dormouse hibernates from October to April/May. In British sources, it is normally called the dormouse rather than the hazel or common dormouse.

The hazel dormouse is native to northern Europe and Asia Minor. It is the only dormouse native to the British Isles, although the edible dormouse (Glis glis) was accidentally introduced to the British Isles and now has an established population).

The locations in the UK where the hazel dormouse can be found is shown on the National Biodivestity Network website.

[[Edible dormouse]]

CATEGORIES: Dormice, Mammals of Europe, Animals of Turkey

The edible dormouse or fat dormouse (Glis glis) is a small dormouse and the only species in the genus Glis.

Fat dormice are the largest dormice in Europe. The ancient Romans used to breed them to be eaten (usually as a snack). This is the reason for the word edible in its name. The dormice were kept in large pits or in terra cotta containers (which were called gliraria), which were like modern hamster cages.

Wild edible dormice are still eaten in Slovenia, and trapping dormice is a Slovenian tradition. Using dormice for food and fur is mentioned in documents which were written in the 13th century. They also mention the use of dormouse fat as a medicine. Poor and hungry peasants would eat dormice during winter because it is a good protein source.

The edible dormouse lives in Europe.  It was accidentally introduced to the town of Tring in England after some dormice escaped from the private collection of Lionel Walter Rothschild in 1902.  The British edible dormouse population is about 10,000 and is found in a 200 triangle between Beaconsfield, Aylesbury and Luton. 

This animal is seen as a pest by some people. In the United Kingdom the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 does not allow some ways of killing them, and to remove the dormice from the area may require a license.

[[Antacid]]

CATEGORIES: Drugs

Antacids (or indigestion tablets) are used to help stop indigestion. People may get indigestion if they eat too much or if they have eaten too fast. With indigestion, the liquid in the stomach will become more acidic. Antacids will neutralise the acids. The reaction that is happening is called neutralisation. This is because the tablets are alkaline and the liquids in the stomach are acidic.

This reaction between the stomach acids and the antacid will make the acid change into harmless substances such as water or salt.

An example of an antacid is milk of magnesia. 

Side effects from taking antacids are rare, but can include both constipation and diarrhea. They are also high in sodium so people with a heart condition on a low salt diet should ask their doctor before taking them.

[[West Nile virus]]

CATEGORIES: Diseases caused by viruses, Diseases spread by insects, Viruses

West Nile Virus (WNV) is a virus that belongs to the genus Flavivirus.  It causes an infectious disease called "West Nile virus disease" or just "West Nile virus."  WNV mainly infects birds, but it can also infect humans, horses, dogs, bats, cats, reptiles, and amphibians.

West Nile virus is spread by mosquitoes, who get the virus from birds.  If a mosquito bites a bird that has WNV, and then bites a human, that person can get West Nile Virus.

West Nile virus was first discovered in 1937, in the West Nile area of Uganda, in East Africa.  (This is how the virus got its name.)  However, before the 1990s, there were very few cases of WNV.  Then there was an outbreak in Algeria in 1994 and another in Romania in 1996.  By 2004, the virus had spread to North America, the Caribbean islands, and Latin America.  It continues to spread through Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, the Middle East, Canada, and the United States.  In 2012, one of the worst West Nile virus epidemics yet happened in the United States; 286 people died.

CATEGORIES: 3rd millennium, Millennia

The 3rd millennium started on January 1, 2001 and will end on December 31, 3000. 

[[Century leap year]]

CATEGORIES: Years, Calendars

In the Gregorian calendar, a century leap year is a year that is exactly divisible by 400. Like all other leap years, these years have February 29. If a year is divisible by 100 but not 400, it is a common year (not a leap year). For example, the years 1600 and 2000 were century leap years; the century years 1700, 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, and 2300 are all common years. The next century leap year will occur in the year 2400.  Century leap years always begin on a Saturday, and February 29 always falls on a Tuesday. 

The start days of exceptional common years (century years not evenly divisible by 400) also varies; the century year begins on a Friday if the remainder obtained by dividing it by 400 is 100, Wednesday if the remainder is 200, and Monday if the remainder is 300.

The Gregorian calendar more accurately tracks Earth's revolution around the Sun, more so than the older Julian calendar, in which every fourth year (including end-of-century years) is a leap year.  Because of this, the Julian calendar began to gradually drift with respect to the four seasons.  Each season has been occurring earlier and earlier over time.  Therefore when the Gregorian calendar was created in 1582, it eliminated this problem by specifying that end-of-century years are only leap years if divisible by 400. Therefore, 1700 was the first end-of-century year that was not a leap year.

[[Plywood]]

CATEGORIES: Wood, Materials

Plywood is a manufactured wood which is made by gluing several thin sheets of wood together with the grain alternately running along the sheet then across it. 

The veneer is usually about 3 millimetres thick for each layer.  Interior layers of these boards are usually made from an inexpensive wood while the outer veneer layers are made from more expensive timber to give the board a nice wood grain appearance.  The glued layers are heated together to make the seal become better bonded. 

A common reason for using plywood instead of plain wood is its resistance to cracking, shrinking and changing shape.  It is cheaper and stronger than most plain woods.

It is used to make a range of things from sheds, to cladding to cabinets. It is graded on the quality, from class A to class D, A being the best quality and D being the worst quality.

Different kinds of plywood are made for different purposes. Marine plywood, for example, is especially resistant to water. There is a world-wide industry making plywood for structural purposes. IKEA is well-known for using mostly plywood and chipboard in their indoor and outdoor furniture products.

[[Medical Renaissance]]

CATEGORIES: Renaissance, Medicine

The Medical Renaissance from 1400 to 1700 AD is a period of progress in European medical knowledge. There was a new interest in the ideas of the ancient Greeks and Romans. The medical discoveries during the Medical Renaissance paved the way for modern medicine. 

Progress made during the Medical Renaissance depended on several things. By studying anatomy they learnt the positions of bones, muscles, and organs. Andreas Vesalius published  De humani corporis fabrica (On the fabric of the human body) in 1543. That was the first time in history that realistic diagrams of dissections were published.

Much later (1628) the Englishman William Harvey discovered that blood is pumped by the heart, travels through the body in blood vessels, and returns back to the heart in the circulatory system. Thus basic facts of anatomy and physiology began to be understood by physicians. However, Harvey's work belongs to a later period. At the beginning of the period, in 1400, doctors were ignorant of physiology and had some (to us) pretty strange ideas. 

[[Mixotroph]]

CATEGORIES: Ecology, Biology

A mixotroph is an organism that can use a mix of different sources of energy and carbon. Usually this means that it may be either autotroph or heterotroph at different times in its life.

[[Control of fire by early humans]]

CATEGORIES: Fire, Human skills

When humans first learned how to control fire, it was an important step in their culture. It allowed humans to cook food and get warmth and protection. Making fire also allowed activity into the dark, and gave some protection from predators and insects.

The cooking of food was probably the most useful effect of fire. There are foods like nuts and fruits which do not need cooking, but others, such as root vegetables, mostly need cooking. 

It is not known for sure when fire was first controlled by humans. Evidence for the use of fire by Homo erectus by about 400,000 years ago has wide scholarly support. Claims for the  earliest definitive evidence of control of fire by a member of Homo range from 0.2 to 1.7 million years ago (mya).

[[Interval (mathematics)]]

CATEGORIES: Mathematics

In mathematics, an interval is a group of numbers that includes all numbers between the beginning and the end. Numbers that are larger than the beginning number and smaller than the end number are inside the interval, and numbers that are smaller than the beginning number or larger than the end number are not in the interval. The beginning number and end number may or may not be inside the interval. An example of an interval might be from 3.3 to 15. Here, numbers such as 4, 8, 9.5, 14, and even 14.999 are inside this interval. Numbers such as -4, 2, 3.2, 20, and 15.000001 are not inside this interval.

To write an interval, write either a square bracket ( ) or a parenthesis ( ( ), the beginning number, a comma ( , ), the end number, and either a closing square bracket (  ) or a closing parenthesis ( )''' ).  Examples of intervals are (4, 9.6), 100, [-30, -4).

[[Nicolas Desmarest]]

CATEGORIES: French geologists, 1725 births, 1815 deaths

Nicolas Desmarest (16 September 1725 – 20 September 1815) was a French geologist.

Desmarest was born at Soulaines in the department of Aube in France. He was educated at the college of the Oratorians of Troyes and Paris. While doing this, he earned money by teaching, to pay for his education. 

Buffon's Theory of the Earth interested him, and in 1753 he won a prize by writing an essay on the ancient connection between England and France. A lot of people were interested in this. He was given job studying and reporting on manufacturing in different countries. In 1788 he became inspector-general of the industries of France.

Demarest travelled around on foot to learn more about the Earth's structure. In 1763 he noticed that the basalt rocks in Auvergne were old lava streams. He noticed that they were similar to the columns of the Giant's Causeway in Ireland. He knew that they were evidence of the operations of old volcanoes which were no longer active. 

In 1774 he published an essay on the subject (with a geological map) after visiting the area a few times. He then discussed the changes that the rocks had gone through because of weathering and erosion. This was the first time that anyone had talked about valleys being made because streams which flowed through them eroding the rocks.

He died in Paris in 1815. In 1823 his son Anselme Gaëtan Desmarest published a new and better edition of his map.

[[Clergyman]]

CATEGORIES: Christian religious occupations

A clergyman is an ordained minister of the Anglican Church, or of some other Protestant churches. 'Vicar' and 'pastor' are other possibilities. 'Rector' is used in some Scottish Presbyterian churches. 'The clergy' is often used as a group term. The word 'cleric', meaning a clerk, is the root term. It comes from the fact that all clerics could read and write, at a time when this was a rare skill.

By general use and convention, Anglican ministers are not called priests. This is because the unqualified term 'priest' or 'father' is widely used as referring to the Catholic Church. Of course, in modern times an Anglican minister may be female, in which case the term 'reverend' or 'minister' may be used.

[[Endemism]]

CATEGORIES: Ecosystems

Endemism is an ecological word meaning that a plant or animal lives only in a particular location, such as a specific island, habitat type, nation or other defined zone. For example, many species of lemur are endemic to the island of Madagascar. 

There are two types of endemism - paleoendemism and neoendemism. Paleoendemism means that a species used to live in a large area but now lives only in a smaller area. Neoendemism means that a species has recently appeared which is closely related to the main species or one that has formed following hybridization and is now classified as a separate species. This is a common process in plants especially those which exhibit polyploidy.

The opposite of endemism is cosmopolitan distribution.

Endemic types are most likely to develop on islands because they are isolated. This includes remote island groups, like the Hawaiian Islands, the Galápagos Islands, and Socotra. Endemism can also occur in areas which are separated from other similar areas like the highlands of Ethiopia, or large bodies of water like Lake Baikal.

Endemics can easily become endangered or extinct because of only living in a small area. They are also vulnerable to the actions of man, including the introduction of new organisms. There were millions of both Bermuda petrels and "Bermuda cedars" (actually junipers) in Bermuda when it was settled at the start of the 17th century. By the end of the century, the petrels were thought to be extinct. Cedars, whose numbers were low as a result of centuries of shipbuilding, were nearly made extinct in the 20th Century by the introduction of a parasite. Both petrels and cedars are very rare today, as are other species endemic or native to Bermuda.

Endemic organisms are not the same as indigenous organisms — a species that is indigenous to somewhere may be native to other locations as well. An introduced species, also known as a naturalized or exotic species, is an organism that is not indigenous to a given place or area.

[[Namtap]]

Michael Rogers Oldfield Thomas (usually known as Oldfield Thomas) FRS (February 21, 1858 – June 16, 1929) was a British zoologist.

Thomas worked at the Natural History Museum in their mammals department. He described about 2,000 new species and sub-species for the first time. He was given a job in the Museum Secretary's office in 1876. In 1878 he moved to the Zoological Department. In 1891 Thomas married a woman who was an heiress to a large amount of money. Having this money allowed him to hire mammal collectors and to give their specimens to the museum. In 1896 when William Henry Flower took control of the Department he hired Richard Lydekker to rearrange the exhibitions. This gave Thomas the time to concentrate on these new specimens.  He committed suicide in 1929 when he was 71 years old. This was not long after the death of his wife.

[[Twin paradox]]

CATEGORIES: Relativity

The twin paradox in physics is a thought experiment in special relativity. It involves identical twins, one of whom makes a journey into space in a high-speed rocket and returns home to find that the twin who remained on Earth has aged more. 

The paradox depends upon the unspoken idea that the passage of time is the same in all circumstances. But this is not correct. Time is relative and the speed of light through a vacuum is the only constant. And the universe is relativistic, not Newtonian. Every single test which has been made has shown this.

In cell biology, the centrosome is an organelle that is the main place where cell microtubules are organized. Also, it regulates the cell division cycle, the stages which lead up to one cell dividing in two. 

The centrosome was discovered by Edouard Van Beneden in 1883, and was described and named in 1888 by Theodor Boveri. 

The centrosome has apparently only evolved in animal cells. Fungi and plants use other structures to organize their microtubules. Although the centrosome has a key role in efficient mitosis in animal cells, it is not necessary.

A centrosome is composed of two centrioles at right angles to each another. They are surrounded by a shapeless mass of protein.

[[Vesicle]]

CATEGORIES: Organelles

A vesicle is a bubble of liquid within a cell. More technically, a vesicle is a small membrane-enclosed sac that stores or transports substances within a cell. Vesicles form naturally because of the properties of lipid membranes. Vesicles can fuse with the plasma membrane, and release their contents outside the cell. Vesicles can also fuse with other organelles within the cell. 

A vesicle is sometimes formed when the cell is doing endocytosis. Endocytosis is a process in which a cell's membrane takes in a particle from the outside and brings it inside the cell with a vesicle around it. 

Vesicles are also more commonly known as nuclear membranes, because they're very similar to the cell membrane. 

They can be found in animal cells.

[[Forest dormouse]]

CATEGORIES: Dormice

The forest dormouse (Dryomys nitedula) is a species of rodent in the Gliridae family found throughout much of Eurasia.

[[Cytoskeleton]]

CATEGORIES: Cell biology

The cytoskeleton is a kind of scaffolding present in all cells. It is made of protein.

It keeps cell shape, protects the cell and enables cells to move (using structures such as flagella and cilia). It helps transport inside the cytoplasm (the movement of vesicles and organelles, for example), and in cell division. The concept and the term (cytosquelette, in French) was introduced by French embryologist Paul Wintrebert in 1931.

Eukaryote cells contain three main kinds of cytoskeletal filaments, which are microfilaments (actin filaments), intermediate filaments, and microtubules. They give the cell structure and shape. Cytoskeletal elements interact closely and often with the cell membrane and the endoplasmic reticulum.

The two specimens had the following measurements:

Cjaetocauda is nocturnal (it is awake at night) and arboreal (lives in trees). It nests in trees about 3 above the ground and the two specimens were found at an altitude of more than 2500 above sea level. It is classified as endangered by the IUCN as of the 2004 Red List due to its small isolated habitat.

[[Centromere]]

CATEGORIES: Cell biology

The centromere is a special region of a chromosome, usually near the middle. It is where the two identical sister chromatids stay in contact as the chromosome attaches to the spindle in mitosis. The region contains specific types of DNA, which are tandem repetitive sequences (satellite DNA). These sequences bind specific proteins called "cen"-proteins.

During mitosis the centromeres can be seen during the metaphase stage as a constriction at the chromosome. At this centromeric constriction the two halves of the chromosome, the sister chromatids, are held together until late metaphase.

[[Grand Cross]]

CATEGORIES: Plant physiology, Ecology, Gram-negative bacteria

Rhizobia are soil bacteria which become established inside root nodules of legumes (the pea family: Fabaceae). 

They fix nitrogen in a form the plant can use. Rhizobia require a plant host; they cannot independently fix nitrogen. The relationship is a classic example of symbiosis and mutualism.

The word rhizobia comes from the English root for root (rhizo) and the Ancient Greek for life (bios).

[[Paul Steinitz]]

CATEGORIES: 1909 births, 1988 deaths, British conductors, English organists

Paul Steinitz (born Chichester, 25 August 1909; died Old Oxted, Surrey, 21 April 1988) was an English conductor and organist. He was one of the first musicians in the 20th century to make a careful study of the way that music by Johann Sebastian Bach should be performed so that it would sound like it used to in Bach’s day, in the early 18th century. He started a choir called the London Bach Society and a group of instrumentalists called the Steinitz Bach Players. He conducted them in lots of concerts. During the space of 25 years he performed all the cantatas of J.S. Bach in London. There are over 200 of them.

[[London Bach Society]]

CATEGORIES: Choirs, British orchestras

The London Bach Society is a society devoted to performing the music of Johann Sebastian Bach.

The London Bach Society was started in 1946 by Paul Steinitz because he wanted to perform Bach in a style which was like the way it sounded in Bach's time. Bach lived from 1685 to 1750. By the 20th century a lot of things had changed in music. Choirs and orchestras were much bigger and instruments were made differently. Steinitz wanted to get back to the sort of sound that Bach would have known. He started a choir called the London Bach Society so that they could give concerts of Bach's music, making it sound much clearer than it did with huge, romantic choirs.

The choir was formed in 1947. The singers were good amateur singers. Steinitz rehearsed them a lot until they were very good. The London Bach Society (LBS) gave many concerts of Bach's music, as well as singing music by other Baroque composers such as Handel, Telemann and Heinrich Schütz. They also sang works by modern composers such as Stravinsky, John Tavener and Nicholas Maw. Between 1958 and 1987 the LBS choir performed all the cantatas by Bach which survive. 208 of them are known. Many others have been lost. The choir performed one of Bach's passions every Lent, usually the St Matthew Passion. They also went on tour, travelling to the USA, Israel, Bulgaria and twice to the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) where they sang at St Thomas Church, Leipzig, where Bach had been Director of Music.

In 1968 Steinitz got a group of players together, calling them the Steinitz Bach Players. They were professional musicians who understood how to play Baroque music. Gradually he was able to add more and more historical instruments to his concerts, such as the natural/clarino trumpet, oboe da caccia, baroque flute and sackbuts. By 1985 there were enough professional players of Baroque instruments in England for the LBS choir to be able to perform the St Matthew Passion with a complete orchestra of period instruments in Wells Cathedral and later in 1987 at Westminster Abbey

After Steinitz's death in 1989 there was no more choir, but the society still continues. Today they organize a festival of Bach's music every year, called "Bachfest" (German for "Bach Festival").

[[Blood diamond]]

CATEGORIES: Conflicts, Minerals

A blood diamond, also known as a conflict diamond, is a diamond that came from an area which is controlled by armed groups which oppose the rules and regulations of governments. These diamonds are mined by civilians who have been ordered by the armed groups to do so (most of them are children), and typically if they refuse to do the work they may be possibly raped, abused, or even murdered. The diamonds are then sold and used to buy weapons to help the armed groups fight against the government. Because of this, most of the blood diamond mining happens in war zones. This is a form of exploitation. They are traded illegally. There have been 3.7 million deaths over diamonds. The Kimberly Process Certification Scheme(KPCS) helps keep blood diamonds out of markets, although most of these diamonds are assumed to be legitimate it is difficult to tell with all of the smuggling. Over 80 (81) countries participate in the KPCS. Every KPCS certified diamond has to be labeled with a specific government number.

According to the Hebrew Bible, Solomon’s Temple, was the first temple the Israelites built for God. It was also called the first temple and was first built by Solomon. It stood next to the king’s palace, and was both God’s royal palace and Israel’s center of worship. The Bible says that the Lord said to Solomon, “I have consecrated (made special or clean) this temple…by putting my Name there forever. My eyes and my heart will always be there” (1 King 9:3). A symbol of holiness and royalty, it reminded the Israelites that God was the special head of Israel. It was patterned after the tabernacle and, in general, other temples at that time, and was divided into three important areas: the Most Holy Place, the Holy Place and the outer courtyard. It was built in Jerusalem, on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite, where Solomon's father David had bought to build an altar to God.

[[Extremophile]]

CATEGORIES: Microbiology, Protista, Extremophiles

An extremophile is an organism (a living thing) which lives best in extreme conditions that are harmful to most life on Earth. They are different from organisms that live in normal places, called mesophiles or neutrophiles.

In the 1980s and 1990s, biologists found that microbes can survive in extreme environments. These are niches that are extreme in some way. They may be extremely hot, or cold, or dry, or under huge pressure, or very salty or acidic. Complex organisms, such as animals or plants, cannot live in these environments. 

Some scientists suggest that life may have begun on Earth in hydrothermal vents far below the ocean surface. Environments such as hot oceans, hot springs and deep ocean hydrothermal vents would have been common during the Archaean eon, about 3.9 billion years ago. Early forms of life lived in those conditions.

The Great Seal of the State of Alabama is the state seal of the U.S. state of Alabama. It was designed in 1817 by William Wyatt Bibb, the governor of the "Alabama Territory" and the subsequent first governor of the state. When Alabama became a state in 1819, the state legislature got the design as the official state seal. The seal prominently has a map showing one of the state's most valuable resources—its major rivers. Bibb's design served as the official seal until 1868, when it was replaced by a controversial design having on it an eagle holding in its beak a banner that read "Here We Rest." The legislature and Governor Frank M. Dixon restored Bibb's original design in 1939, and it has remained unchanged since.

[[Night]]

CATEGORIES: Parts of a day

Night or nighttime is the time when the Sun is not in the sky. Night happens after dusk and before dawn. The opposite of night is day. The start and end times of night are different in different geographic locations. It varies on season, latitude, longitude and timezone.

In other time zones, the night occurs at different times. This is because the Sun shines on different parts of the Earth at different times. During a solar eclipse it is also partially night because the Sun is blocked out by the Moon.

In popular culture, night is often thought of as a symbol of evil, possibly because of the fear of the dark or possibly because of the lack of visibility.

[[Lent]]

CATEGORIES: Liturgical calendar

Lent, in the Christian tradition, is a period of about six weeks before Easter. It is a time in which Christians are supposed to be quiet and thoughtful, preparing themselves for Easter.  They should pray a lot, give money to charities and give up some of the things they might otherwise do for pleasure.  The period of Lent ends at Easter, which is a time of great celebration as the Christians think of how Jesus had died on the cross but then rose again from the dead.

Lent is traditionally supposed to be forty days long. That is because the Bible says that Jesus spent forty days in the wilderness, preparing for his death and resurrection.

Lent begins on Ash Wednesday. In the Catholic Church, it ends at the Ninth Hour of Maundy Thursday (44 days). In The Anglican Catholic Church, it ends on Holy Saturday (46 days).

Churches in the Byzantine tradition (for example, Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic) count the days of Lent differently.  There are also different local traditions in the Oriental Orthodox church.

Lent is traditionally a time for fasting (not eating much).  This tradition was useful because it was a time when food which had been kept for the winter had to be eaten up before it went bad. Many Roman Catholics do not eat meat other than fish on Fridays during Lent.

The word "lent" came from the Old English lencten meaning "spring" (the season).

[[Catherine of Alexandria]]

CATEGORIES: 280s births, 305 deaths, People from Alexandria, Christian saints

Saint Catherine of Alexandria, also known as Saint Catherine of the Wheel and The Great Martyr Saint Catherine (Greek ἡ Ἁγία Αἰκατερίνη ἡ Μεγαλομάρτυς) is a Christian saint and martyr. She is believed to have been a well-known scholar in the 4th century. In the 15th century it was claimed she had spoken to Joan of Arc. The Orthodox Church venerates her as a "great martyr", and in the Catholic Church she is traditionally revered as one of the Fourteen Holy Helpers.

Catherine was the daughter of Costus, a pagan governor of Alexandria. She announced to her parents that she would only marry someone who was more beautiful, intelligent and rich than herself. In addition, that person needed to have a better social status than she had. Eventually, she discovered Christ. "His beauty was more radiant than the shining of the sun, His wisdom governed all creation, His riches were spread throughout all the world."

She was a martyr, because she died for her beliefs in God. According to legend, she was supposed to die on a breaking wheel, but the wheel broke as soon as she touched it, so her head was cut off instead. Because of this, her main symbol is the spiked wheel, which is known as a Catherine wheel. The Catholic Church of St. Catherine, one of the first Catholic churches built in Russia, was named after her.

[[Seed plants]]

CATEGORIES: Plant taxonomy, Seed plants

Seed plants are a group of plants. Gymnosperms and angiosperms form the group. Their seeds have three parts: (1) an embryo, (2) a supply of nutrients for the embryo, and (3) a seed coat. They are also called spermatophytes or phanerogams. The seed plants dominate almost all the environments on land.

The living spermatophytes form five groups: 

The fossil seed ferns (Pteridospermatophyta) were one of the earliest successful groups of land plants, and forests dominated by seed ferns were prevalent in the Permian. Glossopteris was the most prominent tree genus in the ancient southern supercontinent of Gondwana during the Permian period. By the Triassic period, seed ferns had declined, (perhaps were extinct) and modern gymnosperm groups were abundant and dominant to the Upper Cretaceous, when angiosperms radiated.

The Cynodonts are a sub-order of the Therapsida. Cynodonts, one of the most diverse groups of therapsids, are named after their dog-like teeth.

The taxon is a clade which includes modern mammals and their extinct close relatives, the Mammaliaformes. 

The cynodonts lived in all continents, and their fossil record begins in the Upper Permian 256 million years ago.

The extinct members of the group were victims of the End-Triassic extinction event, but the line that led to the mammals survived.

[[Reflex]]

CATEGORIES: Reflexes, Physiology

A reflex (/ˈriːfleks/) or reflex action is an automatic and fast movement in response to a stimulus.  

A true reflex is a behaviour done by the reflex arc. This is the path the signal of a reflex takes. That path is from the outside stimulus to the central nervous system (CNS), then the path from the CNS to the appropriate muscle. 

The nerve cells responsible for reflexes are not always in the brain, but often in the spinal cord. This way, reflexes are processed faster. Nerve cells in the brain still get feedback that the reflex action occurred. And, of course, reflex actions involving sight and sound are done by the brain. With invertebrate animals, the brain is not so dominant, and more is done by local reflex arcs in the segments.

Reflexes may take place even after death. The bite of a poisonous snake can be triggered up to several hours after it has died.

If the behaviour is complex, the stimulus is called a releaser, and the behaviour which follows may involve the whole animal for a long time in what is called a fixed action pattern. However, this is not the usual use of the term "reflex". It is studied in ethology because it usually involves two animals of the same species.

[[Alamosaurus]]

CATEGORIES: Titanosaurs, Cretaceous dinosaurs

Alamosaurus was a titanosaur, a gigantic plant-eating dinosaur from the Upper Cretaceous period, about 73 million to 65 million years ago. 

Alamosaurus was a long-necked, whip-tailed dinosaur. It was about 69 feet (21 m) long and weighed perhaps 33 tons (30000 kg). Fossils have been found in New Mexico, Texas, and Utah. Fossils include fragmentary skeletons (and no skulls).

Skeletal elements of Alamosaurus are among the most common Late Cretaceous dinosaur fossils found in the American Southwest and are now used to define the fauna of that time and place. There was a climate change in this area, it became drier, and this caused changes in the fauna. Thomas M. Lehman describes it as "the abrupt reemergence of a fauna with a superficially 'Jurassic' aspect". These faunas are dominated by Alamosaurus and feature abundant Quetzalcoatlus in Texas. The Alamosaurus  Quetzalcoatlus association probably represent semi-arid inland plains.p201

[[Age of the Earth]]

CATEGORIES: Earth, Geology, Earth sciences, History of ideas, History of science

The age of the Earth is estimated at a little over 4.5 billion years. Working this out was a difficult problem to solve. For most of human history, the basic facts about the planet were unknown. The problem was tackled by Earth scientists in the twentieth century.

Modern estimates are based on radioactive dating methods. The oldest minerals on Earth – small crystals of zircon from the Jack Hills of Western Australia – are at least 4.4 billion years old. Ca-Al-rich inclusions – the oldest known solid bits in meteorites formed within the solar system – are 4.567 billion years old. This gives an age for the solar system and an upper limit for the age of Earth.

Isaac Watts (17 July 1674 – 25 November 1748) was an English pastor, preacher, poet, and hymn writer. He is often called the "Father of English Hymnody": he was the first popular English hymn writer. Because of his short height and large head, in all his portraits Isaac Watts wore a large gown. He wrote about 600 hymns including When I Survey the Wondrous Cross, Am I a Soldier of the Cross, and Joy to the World. He is buried today in Bun­hill Fields Cem­etary, Lon­don, Eng­land.

Isaac Watts was born in 1674 as a small and sickly child. At this time, his father was in prison for being a nonconformist preacher. At that time in England, a man who did not preach the way the leaders of the Church of England thought about God could go to prison. Christians who were dissenters met secretly in fields and barns to hide from people who would report them. Dissenters were fined for preaching anywhere if five or more people were there. Isaac Watts gave much encouragement for people to continue to believe in Christ.

[[Acarina]]

CATEGORIES: Arachnids, Parasites

The Acarina, or Acari, are the mites and ticks. They are an order of Arachnids.

Their fossil history goes back to the Devonian era. Most acarines are tiny: less than a millimetre. It is estimated that over 50,000 species have been described, but a million or more species may be currently living. The study of mites and ticks is called acarology.

Acarines live in practically every habitat, and include aquatic (freshwater and sea water) and terrestrial species. They outnumber other arthropods in the soil and detritus. Many are parasitic, and they affect both vertebrates and invertebrates. Most parasitic forms are external parasites, while the free living forms are generally predators and may even be used to control undesirable arthropods. Others help to break down forest litter and dead organic matter such as skin cells. Others still are herbivorous and may damage crops. Damage to crops is perhaps the most costly economic effect of mites, especially by the spider mites and their relatives, earth mites, thread-footed mites and the gall and rust mites.

Some parasitic forms affect humans and other mammals, causing damage by their feeding, and can even be vectors of diseases such as scrub typhus and rickettsia. A well-known effect of mites on humans is as an allergen which stimulates asthma. Predatory mites may be used in pest control and herbivorous mites used to attack weeds. A positive contribution of the Acari is their normal functioning in ecosystems, especially their roles in the decomposer subsystem.

[[Seven-arm octopus]]

CATEGORIES: Cephalopods

The seven-arm octopus (Haliphron atlanticus), also known as the septopus or the heptopus, is claimed to be the largest octopus. The claim is based on a partial specimen, and the estimation is of a 4 metre length and a weight of 75 kg. The North Pacific giant octopus is its rival in size.

In 2002, a single specimen of giant proportions was caught by fisheries trawling off the eastern Chatham Rise, New Zealand. This specimen, the largest of this species and of all octopuses, was the first validated record of Haliphron from the South Pacific. It had a mantle length of 0.69 m, total length of 2.90 m, and weight of 61.0 kg, although it was incomplete.

[[Hierarchical database model]]

CATEGORIES: Database modeling

In a Hierarchical database model is a data model where the data is organised like a tree. The structure allows repeating information using parent/child relationships: each parent can have many children but each child only has one parent. All attributes of a specific record are listed under an entity type.

In a database, an entity type is the equivalent of a table; each individual record is represented as a row and an attribute as a column. Entity types are related to each other using 1: N mapping, also known as one-to-many relationships. 

The most recognized and used hierarchical databases are IMS developed by IBM and Windows Registry by Microsoft.

[[Network model (database)]]

CATEGORIES: Database modeling

Database systems use a network model to store their data in a graph. Much like the Hierarchical database model, the nodes of the graph contain information. The information  is stored in a graph, so one parent can have many children, and one child can relate to several parents. The model is also known as CODASYL model, because it was originally proposed by the CODASYL consortium (who also developed COBOL).

In a network model, the defining feature is that each record has a link to another record.

Piracy in the Caribbean was the terror of the Caribbean Sea, especially to the Spanish navy that controlled those seas. The English had defeated the Spanish Armada in 1588, which stopped the Spanish control of the oceans.  However, the Spanish still controlled the Caribbean. 

In the 1770s, the English used pirates to help their government. By doing harm to the Spanish navy and export, the English hoped to get more land in the New World and stop the Spanish from controlling the New World trade. They did get what they wanted, but made a new problem.

[[Cerapod]]

CATEGORIES: Cerapods

The Cerapods are a sub-order of the Ornithischia. They are all herbivorous dinosaurs. They have thicker enamel on the inside of their lower teeth. The teeth wear unevenly, and this allows them to browse on tough vegetation.

They are divided into three groups:

[[Ceratopsia]]

CATEGORIES: Ceratopsia

The Ceratopsia are the horned dinosaurs of the order Ornithischia. Triceratops is the best-known, and one of the largest. They are a group of herbivorous, beaked dinosaurs which thrived in what is now North America and Asia, during the Cretaceous period.

Ancestral forms of this group lived earlier, in the Jurassic. Early members, such as Psittacosaurus, were small and bipedal. 

Later members, including Centrosaurus and Triceratops, became very large quadrupeds. They developed elaborate facial horns and a neck frill. The frill served mainly to protect the vulnerable neck from bipedal predators like Tyrannosaurus, who attacked from above. 

The frill was no doubt also used in display, thermoregulation, the attachment of large neck and chewing muscles or some combination of the above. 

Ceratopsians ranged in size from 1 meter (3 ft) and 23 kilograms (50 lb) to over 9 meters (30 ft) and 5,400 kg (12,000 lb).

Triceratops is by far the best-known ceratopsian to the general public.

[[Pachycephalosauria]]

CATEGORIES: Pachycephalosauria

The Pachycephalosaurs are a group of ornithopod dinosaurs in the suborder Cerapoda. Their thick round skulls were used for defence and, probably, for mating contests.

In some species, the skull roof is domed and several inches thick; in others it is flat or wedge-shaped.The flat-headed pachycephalosaurs are usually regarded as distinct species or even families, but they may be juveniles of dome-headed adults. The domes were often surrounded by nodes and/or spikes.

There is evidence of head-butting in pachycephalosaurs. Of 100 domes studied, 20 percent showed signs of healed injuries, all consistent with combative behavior. The pathologies included pitting where the bone had become infected from wounds that originated in the skin. These findings suggest that pachycephalosaurids may have been using their heads for both display and defence as many modern animals do.

The law of conservation of mass states that mass can neither  be created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction.  Thus, the amount of matter cannot change. Sir Antoine Lavoisier promoted this idea. 

This law says that when a chemical reaction rearranges atoms into a new product, the mass of the reactants (chemicals before the chemical reaction) is the same as the mass of the products (the new chemicals made). More simply, whatever you do, you will still have the same amount of stuff.  

Broader account: In any chemical reaction, nuclear reaction, or radioactive decay in an isolated system, the total mass of the starting materials must be equal to the mass of the products.

[[Christian liturgy]]

CATEGORIES: Christian worship and liturgy

A Christian liturgy is a set of steps or rituals done by Christians as a form of worship, done by Christian denomination. The liturgy or form of worship has changed over time, and different groups also have different prescriptions on how such a celebration should be done. The worship on a Sunday might be different from that which is done on Easter.

Anglican, Orthodox, Lutheran, or other groups, when using the words "the liturgy", normally mean a standardized order of events observed during a religious service, often including the Eucharist or Communion. Liturgy may mean an elaborate formal ceremony such as the Catholic Mass. The open or waiting worship of Quakers is an example of a non-liturgical service because there is no structured order of events.

Liturgical churches are those that use a well-defined liturgy, in which many of the words and music used follow basic patterns each time the service is conducted. The liturgy may date to the second century or earlier. Most Orthodox, Catholic, Anglican, and Lutheran churches are liturgical, most other churches to a far lesser extent. Non-liturgical churches usually follow a common worship sequence from one service to the next, with several elements common to many such services. These elements often include readings from the Bible, hymns, a sermon, offerings of money, and at certain times, Communion.

[[Alveolus]]

CATEGORIES: Anatomy of the respiratory system

An alveolus (plural: alveoli) is a word used in anatomy for hollow cavities, which are empty areas within a body.

Although there are many different types of alveoli in the body, the word alveoli is usually used to talk about small air sacs in the lungs of mammals. These are also called pulmonary alveoli. These alveoli are located at the ends of the air passageways in the lungs. They have very thin (one cell thick), wet walls and are surrounded with a network of small blood vessels, or capillaries. This allows gases to diffuse, or move across, the surface of the alveolus.

When a mammal breathes in, the concentration of oxygen is higher in the alveolus than in the red blood cells. Therefore, oxygen leaves the alveolus and enters the red blood cells. When a mammal breathes out, the opposite happens. The concentration of carbon dioxide is lower in the alveolus than in the red blood cells, so carbon dioxide leaves the red blood cells, enters the alveolus, and is exhaled.

In an average human lung, there are 480 million alveoli. Their total surface area is around 75 square meters.

Inside the alveoli is where a gas exchange occurs. Gas exchange is a biological process through which (usually two) different gases are transferred in opposite directions across a specialised respiratory surface. Gases are constantly required and produced as a by-product of cellular and metabolic reactions so an efficient system for their exchange is extremely important. It is linked with respiration in animals, and both respiration and photosynthesis in plants.

[[Parasitoid]]

CATEGORIES: Parasitoids

Parasitoids are parasites whose larvae develop inside another organism's body. This usually results in the death of the host, which sets them apart from 'traditional' parasites. There are twelve superfamilies of parasitic wasps which are entirely or mainly parasitoid. The largest family are the ichneumons, with over 80,000 species. 

In parasitoids the adult stage is free-living: it finds the 'host' for the next generation. The female parasitoid places the eggs, on or in the body of a host. The host is food for their growth. 

Normal parasites use vectors as the way of getting to other hosts. 

In Hymenoptera there are many variations. The distinction between the 'parasitic' and the 'traditional' hymenoptera can run very thin. 

In Britain there are about 6500 species of Hymenoptera  more than in any other insect order  and just one parasitoid superfamily, the Ichneumonoidea, has nearly half of them. Most workers now recognise only two families in Ichneumonoidea. These are Ichneumonidae, with over two thousand British species, and Braconidae, with nearly 1200 representatives in Britain. They are, respectively, the largest and the second largest families of British insects. Only a beetle family, the Staphylinidae, is near the thousand mark. Ichneumonoids also include the largest parasitoids.

Hymenopteran parasitoids often have unique life cycles. In one family, the Trigonalidae, the female wasps deposit eggs into small pockets they cut into the edge of leaves with their ovipositor. A caterpillar chewing these leaves may swallow some of the eggs. When they get into the caterpillar's gut, they hatch and burrow through the gut wall and into the body cavity. Later they search the caterpillar's body cavity for other parasitoid larvae, and it is these they attack and feed on. Some trigonalids, once they are in a caterpillar or sawfly larva, need their host to fall prey to a social wasp. The wasp carries the caterpillar back to its nest, and there it is butchered and fed to the wasp's young. The young serve as host for the trigonalid, the eggs of which are in the butchered caterpillar.

[[Imago]]

CATEGORIES: Insects

In entomology, the imago is the last stage in the development of an insect. In an incomplete metamorphosis it comes after the last ecdysis. If the metamorphosis is complete, it comes after emergence from the pupa. This is the only stage where the insect is sexually mature and (if a winged species) has functional wings. The imago is often referred to as the adult stage.

Repressive measures included deportations of the population and mass killings; al-Majid was dubbed "Chemical Ali" by Iraqi Kurds for his use of chemical weapons in attacks against them.

Al-Majid was captured after the 2003 invasion of Iraq and was charged with war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. He was convicted in June 2007 and was sentenced to death for crimes committed in the al-Anfal campaign of the 1980s. His appeal against the death sentence was rejected on 4 September 2007, and was sentenced to death for the fourth time on 17 January 2010. Al-Majid was executed by hanging eight days later.

[[Mohs scale of mineral hardness]]

CATEGORIES: Minerals, Tests

Mohs' scale of mineral hardness is named after Friedrich Mohs, a mineralogist. Mohs scale is ordered by hardness, determined by which minerals can scratch other minerals.

Rocks are made up of one or more minerals. According to the scale, Talc is the softest: it can be scratched by all other materials. Gypsum is harder: it can scratch talc but not calcite, which is even harder. The hardness of a mineral is mainly controlled by the strength of the bonding between the atoms and partly by the size of the atoms. It is a measure of the resistance of the mineral to scratching, the Mohs scale is for natural minerals. For manufactured products other measures of hardness are better.

Diamond is always at the top of the scale, being the hardest mineral.  There are ten minerals in Mohs scale, talc, gypsum, calcite, fluorite, apatite, feldspar, quartz, topaz, corundum, and for last and hardest, diamond.  Because the Mohs scale was made long ago, it is not exactly correct - for example, several minerals are now known to be harder than the diamond. December 2020  The Mohs scale may not be perfect, but field geologists still find it very useful.

[[Chelicerata]]

CATEGORIES: Chelicerata

The Chelicerata are a sub-phylum of the Arthropods. The sub-phylum consists of only two classes: the Arachnids and the Merostomata.

The Merostomata are the extinct Eurypterids and the horseshoe crabs (Xiphosura). The horseshoe crabs are a small, ancient group which has survived relatively unchanged for millions of years. Groups like this are often called living fossils. The Arachnida is the huge and successful terrestrial (air-breathing) group of spiders and their relatives.

The chelicerates originated as marine animals. The first confirmed chelicerate fossils, the eurypterids, date from 445 million years ago in the late Ordovician period. Although only four marine species survive, all of them horseshoe crabs, there are over 77,000 species of air-breathing chelicerates, and there may be about 500,000 unidentified species.

The pycnogonids may or may not be Chelicerates. This is in dispute, as genetic evidence suggests they may be an ancient sister group to all other living arthropods. There are 1,300 species of  these 'sea spiders'.

The life-style of chelicerates is largely carnivorous, or other kinds of heterotroph.

One day, Cassiopeia said that her daughter Andromeda was more beautiful than all of the Nereids. The Nereids were sea-nymphs. When the sea-god Poseidon heard what Cassiopeia had said, he was very angry. He sent floods and a sea monster called Cetus to destroy Ethiopia. Cassiopeia and her husband Cepheus asked an oracle what to do. The oracle said that they must sacrifice their daughter so they chained Andromeda to a rock. A hero named Perseus came and rescued Andromeda. Later, they got married.

Poseidon was still angry with Cassiopeia and wanted to punish her. He placed her in the sky. There is a constellation called Cassiopeia named after her.

[[Panpsychism]]

CATEGORIES: Philosophical movements and positions

Panpsychism is the theory that everything in the universe is somewhat sentient or conscious. They are all connected parts of the whole. 

Panpsychists believe  that all matter in the universe has some degree of consciousness.In other words the substance of the universe is composed entirely of mind or consciousness. This is not to say that rocks have a mind but that the individual atoms and other particles in the rock have some sort of awareness and are aware of each other. Panpsychism is opposed to materialism or any doctrine that argues that the reality of the universe is composed solely of matter. Panpsychism needs no supernatural miracle to explain consciousness, it is consciousness. In other words we are all part of a grand communication scheme which is the glue that holds the universe together.

Most Indo-Canadians call themselves "Indian", instead of "East Indian". This is because Christopher Columbus thought the Americas were India, and that Native Americans were Indian.

Most Indo-Canadians come from India, but some come from the Caribbean, South America, Africa, and the Middle East. They usually live in cities like Toronto, Montreal, Ottawa, Calgary, and Vancouver. They are one of the fastest growing races in Canada, because of immigration.

[[Gestalt therapy]]

CATEGORIES: Psychology

Gestalt therapy is a form of psychotherapy. It is a way of treating people who feel ill at ease. It is based on the idea that it is best to experience what we feel "here and now" and not keep thinking about the past or worry about the future. The goal is to help clients become aware of his or her thoughts, behaviours, experiences, and feelings and to "own" or take responsibility for them. 

It forms part of what is called humanistic psychology and was co-founded by Fritz Perls, Laura Perls and Paul Goodman in the 1940s-1950s. 

At the center of Gestalt therapy is the idea of "awareness" (knowing). The person being helped is encouraged to know his or her own feelings and behaviour, and the effect they have upon the world around them. 

With Gestalt therapy, the patient is helped to see that they are trying to avoid feeling emotions from the present. Once the patient realizes this, he or she can begin to get better.

[[Special education]]

CATEGORIES: Education

Some children are disabled, or they have learning difficulties. Special education is about teaching these children. Some of them can be educated with other children of the same age who are not disabled. Others must go to special schools. If the disability is too bad they can not get an education. Students who have emotional problems and act poorly are sometimes expelled from school. Inclusive education is a firmed by the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities to reduce such exclusion.

Special needs include speech or hearing difficulties, emotional and behavioral disorders, physical disabilities, and developmental disorders. Students with these special needs often get more educational services. This may mean different approaches to teaching, access to a resource room and use of technology.

Some students are very smart. These students are called gifted. They also have certain needs so they can succeed. These students do better with special teaching styles or different educational programs. The word 'special education' is used for students whose special needs stop them from learning the way normal people learn. Gifted education is handled separately.

CATEGORIES: Birds of South America, Hummingbirds

The sooty barbthroat (Threnetes niger) is a species of hummingbird. It is found in French Guiana and far north-eastern Brazil. Its habitat is humid tropical lowland forest. Though normally restricted in range, it is common enough to be thought a Species of Least Concern by the IUCN.

The taxonomy and systematics of the Sooty Barbthroat complex has made much confusion. Some authors thought the Sooty Barbthroat to be a "melanistic variant" of the pale-tailed barbthroat (T. leucurus).

Not only that, but some suggest that the bronze-tailed barbthroat (T. n. loehkeni) should also be thought a valid species and have the doubtful Christina's barbthroat (T. n. christinae) as a subspecies. Freire's Sooty barbthroat (T. n. freirei) is average between the sooty and bronze-tailed barbthroats however, and thus its status needs to be more clear before the problem is fixed.

He was frequently called the most brilliant strategist in the Confederate Army. Jackson was considered Robert E. Lee's "right hand". Jackson was mortally wounded at the Battle of Chancellorsville. On May 2, 1863, he was scouting ahead of his lines when one of his own men mistakenly shot him. His left arm was badly wounded requiring the doctors to amputate it two inches below his shoulder. He died on May 10, 1863. He was 39 years old. He likely died of a pulmonary embolism and not from pneumonia.

The Treaty of Paris was the treaty that formally ended the American Revolutionary War between the United Kingdom of Great Britain and the United States of America.

The treaty was signed in Paris on September 3, 1783. The American Congress of the Confederation ratified the treaty on January 14, 1784. The British King George III ratified the treaty on April 9, 1784. 

Under the terms of the treaty, Britain recognized the new nation, agreed to remove all troops, and set new borders of the United States.  The United States agreed to allow British troops to leave and to encourage the states pay all debts owed to Britain.  It also agreed not to persecute the Tories (people loyal to the British king and so also known as loyalists) still in the United States and allow those who left America to return.

France and Spain, who were allies of the United States, also signed peace treaties with Britain.  France got Tobago and Senegal and some other places. Spain wanted Gibraltar but instead got Menorca and Florida. The Netherlands, which signed later, did not gain or lose land but were forced to allow British trade in the Dutch East Indies. 

In India, the Kingdom of Mysore, which was supported by the French until the treaty was signed, continued fighting for another year but also neither gained nor lost any land.

[[Cathode ray]]

CATEGORIES: Electromagnetism, Electricity

A cathode ray is a stream of electrons that are seen in vacuum tubes. It is called a "cathode ray" because the electrons are being emitted from the negative charged element in the vacuum tube called the cathode. A cathode ray tube aims the ray at a point on its screen. They were first observed in 1869 by German physicist Johann Hittorf, and were named in 1876 by Eugen Goldstein Kathodenstrahlen, or cathode rays.

Electrons were discovered as the constituents of cathode rays in 1897 by British physicist J. J. Thomson. He showed the rays were composed of a previously unknown negatively charged particle, which was later called the electron. Cathode ray tubes (CRTs) use a focused beam of electrons deflected by electric or magnetic fields to create the image in a classic television set.

Some properties of cathode rays:

Airbus has made a freighter version, first made in 2001, and a tanker version, first made in 2007 (which carries additional fuel so it can give some to other planes).

There are also 394 A330s that need to be made and given to airlines. Most of these are the smaller 200 series version.

[[Germination]]

CATEGORIES: Botany

Germination occurs when a spore or seed starts to grow. It is a term used in botany. When a spore or seed germinates, it produces a shoot or seedling, or (in the case of fungi) a hypha. The biology of spores is different from seeds.

A spore germinates if and when conditions are right. It has a very limited lifespan. The method of spore-bearers, which are lower plants such as mosses, ferns and also fungi, is to produce vast numbers of spores, of which only a small percentage germinate.

Seeds contain an embryo, a store of food (the endosperm), and a protective coat. Seed plants include Gymnosperms (such as conifers) and Angiosperms (such as flowering plants). Seeds can survive much longer than spores, sometimes for hundreds of years. The strategy of seed-bearing plants is to invest energy and material in the substance of seeds, and they have evolved more sophisticated methods of dispersal than just wind.p98

Seeds do not germinate until their requirements are met, and these needs differ from species to species.

The requirements for fruits is the same as for seeds. A fruit is just a seed with one or more extra layers derived from parts of the flower.

[[Fractal]]

CATEGORIES: Fractals

A fractal is any pattern, that when seen as an image, produces a picture, which when zoomed into will still make the same picture. It can be cut into parts which look like a smaller version of the picture that was started with. The word fractal was made by Benoît Mandelbrot in 1975 from the Latin word fractus, which means "broken" or "fractured". A simple example is a tree that branches into smaller branches, and those branches into smaller branches and so on. Fractals have many practical applications.

CATEGORIES: Diseases and disorders of the cardiovascular system, Dementia

Vascular dementia is the second most common form of dementia after Alzheimer's disease. It is a type of dementia caused by problems in the supply of blood to the brain.

Brain cells need a good supply of blood to stay healthy and function properly. The blood is delivered through a network of blood vessels called the vascular system. If the vascular system within the brain becomes damaged and blood cannot reach the brain cells, the cells will eventually die. This can lead to the onset of vascular dementia.

CATEGORIES: Education in the United States, United States federal legislation, 2002 in the United States

The No Child Left Behind Act is a United States law that was to help students meet higher standards. This law started during President George W. Bush's time in the White House. President Bush made the law official on January 8, 2002. Schools around the US now have to test their students. If they don't, the schools risk losing funds given to them by the federal government. Some parts of this rule include bilingualism standards. All students must be on at least a proficient level (B+) by the 2013-14 school year. 

Since the law started, Congress gave more money to schools from $42.2 billion in 2001 to $54.4 billion in 2007. No Child Left Behind received a 40.4% increase from $17.4 billion in 2001 to $24.4 billion. The funding for reading quadrupled from $286 million in 2001 to $1.2 billion.

[[Resource room]]

CATEGORIES: Education, Learning, Disability

Resource room is a place where special education students attend daily classes. These students are usually included in the general classroom and just need more support. Students are taught individually and in small groups.  The number of students in a resource room is at most five students per teacher.  Mainstreaming in education typically includes this service.  Students in separate classes generally do not need the resource room because all the support they need is in the self-contained classroom.

Special education teachers in resource rooms focus on the goals set by an Individualized Education Program.  These goals are based on the individual student's need to develop executive skills, complete their homework and behave. The programs can help students with language-based learning disabilities like dyslexia. Visuo-motor perception, arithmetic, spelling and overall self-perception improve after time in the resource room classroom.  The small-group instructional model leads to achievement in students with a multitude of educational disabilities.

Their peers also benefit when the concepts they learned in general education are reinforced in resource rooms.

[[End–Ordovician extinction event]]

CATEGORIES: Extinction events, Palaeozoic

The End–Ordovician extinction event is the third-largest extinction event of the Phanerozoic eon. The Ordovician period followed the Cambrian and was followed by the Silurian. There were no living things on the land except for bacteria and perhaps some single-celled algae. The biota was almost entirely marine.

The extinction came in two steps, at the start and the finish of the Hirnantian stage, which was the last stage of the Ordovician. 

Basic mechanism: climate changes from very warm to very cold and back to very warm. Changes in ocean circulation were the results of the climate changes. Both benthic (ocean bottom) and pelagic fauna were faced with conditions they were unable to cope with.

More than 100 invertebrate families becam extinct in the End–Ordovician extinction event, and a total of almost half the genera. The brachiopods and bryozoans were decimated, along with many of the trilobite, conodont and graptolite families. 

The cause was probably the rise and erosion of the Appalachian Mountains. The rise put much CO2 into the atmosphere, and the erosion took it out.

[[Velvet worm]]

CATEGORIES: Minor phyla

The velvet worms (Onychophora — literally "claw bearers") are a minor panarthropod phylum. 

There are two families and about 200 species. All living species live on land, in moist or wet tropical areas.

The two living families are the Peripatidae and the Peripatopsidae. They show a peculiar distribution, with the peripatids being mainly equatorial and tropical, while the peripatopsids are all found in what used to be Gondwana.

The segmented worm-like organisms have tiny eyes, "fur", antennae, multiple pairs of legs, and, slime glands. The group is thought to be related to arthropods. They prey on smaller animals such as insects, which they catch by squirting a sticky slime.

[[Tardigrade]]

CATEGORIES: Minor phyla, Extremophiles

Tardigrades ('water bears') are the members of the tactopod phylum Tardigrada, part of the superphylum Ecdysozoa. They are also known as water bears or moss piglets. They are microscopic, water-dwelling, segmented animals.

Tardigrades were first described in 1773. Their name means "slow stepper". There are more than 1000 different species of tardigrade.

Tardigrades have a cylindrical shape with four segments, each with two legs. Each leg has little claws. The biggest adults may reach a body length of 1.2 mm, the smallest below 0.1 mm. Freshly hatched larvae may be smaller than 0.05 mm. Tardigrades feed on plant cells by penetrating the cell wall and eating what is inside. Some tardigrades are carnivores.

Tardigrades are eutelic, meaning all adult tardigrades of the same species have the same number of cells. Some species have as many as 40,000 cells in each adult, while others have far fewer.

Tardigrades can be found in many habitats: in moss, freshwater, the Himalayas, and the ocean. They are one of the few animals that can be found on the highest mountains and the deepest seas. About 83 percent of the known species live on land, the other 17 percent live in water.

[[Bond (finance)]]

CATEGORIES: Finance

A bond is a contract between two companies.

Companies or governments issue bonds because they need to borrow large amounts of money. They issue bonds and investors buy them (thereby giving money to the people who issued the bond). 

Bonds have a maturity date. This means that at some point, the bond issuer has to pay back the money to the investors. They also have to pay the investors a little bit more than they paid for the bond. Bonds are used to keep the company running smooth when needed, and can be used as protection if their stock drops drastically.

Bonds are usually traded through brokers and are part of a financial instrument group called Fixed Income.

Banks and financial institutions offer loans on different terms against the security of assets.

Simply put, a bond is a receipt given by a government or organization as an agreement to borrow money from another organization which will be returned at a later date with certain amount of interest or increment.

[[Yellow journalism]]

CATEGORIES: Journalism

Yellow journalism or the yellow press is a type of journalism that does not report much real news with facts. It uses shocking headlines that catch people's attention to sell more newspapers. Yellow journalism might include exaggerating facts or spreading rumors.

Yellow press newspapers have several columns and front-page headlines about different types of news, such as sports and scandals.  They use bold layouts (with large illustrations and perhaps color), and stories reported using unnamed sources.  The term was often used to talk about some large New York City newspapers around 1900 as they fought to get more readers than the other newspapers.

In 1941, Frank Mott said that there were five things that made up yellow journalism:

[[Oliver Goldsmith]]

CATEGORIES: 1730 births, 1774 deaths

Oliver Goldsmith (10 November 1730 – 4 April 1774) was a writer, poet, and physician famous for his novel, The Vicar of Wakefield(1776). His first successful literary work was The Traveller (1764), a poem about British rule. Like Jonathan Swift, Goldsmith criticism society, but he did not use satire like Swift. Goldsmith's greatest poem, The Deserted Village (1770), was a sad poem about how country life was being destroyed by landowners. The same theme is inside The Vicar of Wakefield. Goldsmith's biggest work at that time was a collection of soft-satire essays on English life seen by an imaginary Chinese visitor. He also wrote two plays, The Good Natured Man (1768), and She Stoops to Conquer (1773).(He is also thought to have written the classic children's story, The History of Little Goody Two-Shoes.)

[[Sea spider]]

CATEGORIES: Chelicerata

Sea spiders are marine arthropods of the class Pycnogonida. 

There are about 1,300 species of sea spiders, which are found around the world. Sea spiders are found in all oceans, including the Mediterranean Sea, Caribbean Sea, and the Arctic Ocean. Species found in coastal waters are usually small and have a leg span of about 1 inch (2.5 cm), those living at great depths, up to 24 inches (60 cm).

Sea spiders are not true spiders, or even arachnids. Their traditional classification as chelicerates would put them closer to true spiders than to other well-known arthropod groups, such as insects or crustaceans. 

However, recent genetic evidence suggests they may be an ancient sister group to all other living arthropods.

[[Sand dollar]]

CATEGORIES: Echinoderms

The Sand dollars are species of flattened, burrowing sea urchins belonging to the order Clypeasteroida. Echinarachnius parma, the Common Sand Dollar, is widespread in the Northern Hemisphere, from the intertidal zone to considerable depths. Sand dollars can be found in temperate and tropical zones, but not in Great Britain.p76

All sand dollars have a rigid skeleton known as a test. This is the typical white disk found washed up on beaches. The living animals have a skin of movable spines on the test. Movement is done by the action of the spines. Like other sea urchins, sand dollars have five paired rows of pores. The pores are arranged in a petal-like pattern. These pores are perforations in the endoskeleton through which the tube feet, used in gas exchange, project from the body.

[[Ot en Sien]]

CATEGORIES: Children's books, Characters in written fiction, Drenthe

Ot en Sien (Ot and Sien) are two little children who appear in a series of stories which were written in the Dutch language more than a hundred years ago.   Ot (short for “Otto”) is a little boy and Sien (pronounced like the English word “seen”), whose name may be short for “Francine”, is the little girl who lives next door.  Although they are now very old-fashioned, the books are still popular in Holland.  They were written in rhyme and were illustrated with colourful pictures.

The author of the stories was called Hendricus Scheepstra.  The ideas for the stories were given to him by Jan Ligthart.  Cornelis Jetses made the illustrations.

The stories are set in Drenthe, which is in the north-eastern part of the Netherlands.  Drenthe was a very poor part of the country, but Ot and Sien live in a nice house and are quite well-off.  They are often seen playing in the garden with their toys which include a wooden horse on wheels and a doll in a dolly’s pushchair.  The cat is often in the picture.  They are also seen at school.

The authors wrote the stories to show a happy family life.  Everyone is very friendly in the book, and strangers help them when they get lost in the street.  The family have a servant who helps in the house.

The stories were widely read by children in schools in the Netherlands until after the Second World War.  By then they had become very old-fashioned.  The daily life of Ot and Sien seemed to belong to a time long ago in history.   Hardly any Dutch children now live in a family with a servant.  No Dutch child nowadays goes for a walk dressed in sailor’s costume with a father who wears a cloak and hat.  The books are no longer read in schools, but they continue to be popular with Dutch people at home.  In 2004, one hundred years after the first book was written, a special exhibition about Ot and Sien was held.

There is a statue to Ot and Sien in The Hague, made in 1930.

Ruben Bierer (Dr. Rubin Bierer, often: Reuben Bierer; * about 1845 in Lviv; † 1931 ibid.) was a doctor in Sofia and one of the first pioneers of the Jewish nationalism and one of the first active zionists in Galicia and Bulgaria, adherent of Hovevei Zion in Galicia, Austria and Bulgaria.

In 1867 he was in Lviv a co-founder of the first Jewish-political association of Austria-Hungary, Shomer Israel. As an opponent against Polish assimilation of the Jews he established for the 1873 elections of the Reichsrat a Jewish-ruthenian electoral alliance. In 1879 he separated from the Shomer Israel and went to Vienna for the purpose of medical studies where he – together with Peretz Smolenskin – found the Jewish-political association Ahavath Zion (for the reason of colonisation of the holy land).

In 1882 he was a cofounder of the Viennese Kadima Studentenverbindung. In 1883 he returned to Lviv where he founded the first Jewish-national association of the Austrian east, Miqra Kodesh.

In 1885 he went to Serbia, in 1900 he returned to Lviv where he  successless tried to reactivate the Shomer Israel. 

Nathan Birnbaum coined the word zionism about the year 1890. But he is not the creator of this word, it was already in use, e.g. you can find in a letter of Ruben Bierer from the 9th December 1888 the expression zionist brother's greeting. The word zionist is found already in the year 1877 in an in Roumanian written pamphlet (annual report of the order "Zion" in Bucharest). 

[[Hezekiah]]

Hezekiah (meaning God will strengthen) or  יְחִזְקִיָּ֫הוּ Ḥizqiyyāhu (Hebrew), also translated as Ḥizkiyyahu (and sometimes as Ezekias (Greek), Khizkiyahu, Yəḥizqiyyāhu, Y'khizkiyahu), was a king of Judah that appears in the book of 2 Chronicles, chapters 18 to 32, and the book of 2 Kings chapters 18 to 20. He was one of the few kings who is compared favorably with David, and is unique for his trust in the Lord: "There was no one like him among all the kings of Judah, either before him or after him. He held fast to the LORD and did not cease (stop) to follow him" (NIV).

Hezekiah was the son of Judah's King Ahaz, and is best known for turning his people away from the sins of his father Ahaz, restoring worship in the temple, and having his life made 15 years longer. The Book of 2 Chronicles tells more about Hezekiah than any other king after Solomon, and suggests that he is a "second Solomon" in his celebration of the Passover, his wealth, his honor, and his land.

Toward the end of his reign, he became very sick and close to death. He prayed to the Lord, who healed him miraculously. The king of Babylon heard about it and sent men with a letter and gift to Hezekiah. Because Hezekiah was proud of his riches, he showed all of his treasures to the visitors. The prophet Isaiah predicted that it all would later be taken by the Babylonians. His prediction came true.

Left-handedness is the preference to use the left hand more than the right hand for daily activities such as writing or using tools. Most people can use either hand for many things. However, people very often have a definite preference for using the left or right hand for things such as: using a pen, using a knife, using scissors, brushing teeth, blowing their nose, and so on.  People who do not have a preference are called ambidextrous, and people who cannot use either are called ambisinistrous.

People do not just have preferences with things they do with their hands: they may, for example, be left-footed if they prefer to kick a ball with the left foot, or push harder with the left foot on a bicycle pedal.

Far more people are right handed than left handed. It is difficult to measure exactly how many, because each person has a different mixture of preferences, but about 5-10% are left-handed.

[[Cumulus cloud]]

CATEGORIES: Clouds

Cumulus clouds are white clouds that are dense and large. They are known to look like cauliflower. Mostly, you can see easily that cumulus clouds have flat bottoms but the tops are always changing shape. 

Seeing a cumulus cloud means that the air is well mixed by up and down vertical drafts. When a cumulus cloud grows into a thunderstorm, the cloud is called a cumulonimbus cloud. This is a sign that the air is rising to the stratosphere.

[[Alyosha Karamazov]]

CATEGORIES: Characters in written fiction, Russian literature

Alexei Fyodorovich Karamazov is the "hero" of Fyodor Dostoevsky's novel, The Brothers Karamazov. He is also called Alyosha, Alyoshka, Alyoshenka, Alyoshechka, Alexeichik, Lyosha, and Lyoshenka. He is the youngest of the Karamazov brothers, being "then only twenty (his brother Ivan was twenty-three and their older brother, Dmitry, twenty-seven)". The author's preface and first chapters declare that he is the novel's hero.

[[Stratus cloud]]

CATEGORIES: Clouds

Stratus clouds are low altitude gray clouds that make a flat base. The name comes from the Latin word stratus, which means to "stretch" or "extend." You can see stratus clouds as thick cloud blankets near the sea. They are sometimes called "high fogs".  Light rain and drizzle often fall from stratus clouds. When rain falls from stratus clouds they are mostly called nimbostratus  The name derives from the Latin word nimbus = rain, and stratus = spread out.  

[[Pliosaur]]

CATEGORIES: Plesiosaurs, Marine reptiles

The Pliosaurs were a group of large submarine plesiosaur reptiles from the Mesozoic era. They had short necks and large heads, in contrast to other plesiosaurs. Their sizes ranged from two to 15 metres, and they were predators of large fish and other reptiles. Their streamlined body shape suggests they swam and ate under water.p29

The first specimen was found by Mary Anning, on the 'Jurassic Coast' of Lyme Regis, England in the 1820s. Many of her finds are on display in the Natural History Museum, London.

It was suggested by D.M.S. Watson that plesiosaurs fell into two groups. The pliosaurs were large predators which ate large prey in deep water. The other plesiosaurs were long-necked with smaller heads. Their method was as surface swimmers, mostly eating with their head above water, darting down to snatch smaller fish which were feeding on plankton.

[[Ball lightning]]

CATEGORIES: Weather

Ball lightning is a glowing ball of lightning that sometimes appears in a thunderstorm, but usually lasts much longer than lightning. Scientists do not understand ball lightning very well, and some even do not think ball lightning is real, because it is so strange. However, it has been widely reported in weather journals by many trustworthy people. So, it is very possible that it is real.

[[Sauropterygia]]

CATEGORIES: Sauropterygia

The Sauropterygia was a superorder of successful aquatic reptiles that flourished during the Mesozoic era. They are united by an adaptation of their shoulder, designed to support powerful paddle strokes. Some later sauropterygians like the pliosaurs developed a similar mechanism in their pelvis.

[[Oceanic trench]]

CATEGORIES: Landforms, Oceanography

Ocean trenches have relatively steep sides falling to the ocean floor.

Ocean trenches are typically caused when an oceanic crustal plate slides under a lighter continental plate or another oceanic plate. It is believed to work by density.  Where one plate slides under another, this is called subduction. As the heavier plate descends, the long, narrow feature caused is called the "subduction zone". It is here that oceanic trenches form. They can be 1,500 miles (2,400 km) long, several miles deep, and as much as 70 miles (112 km) wide.

At least five trenches are over 6 miles (10 km) deep. The greatest ocean depth to be sounded is in the Challenger Deep of the Mariana Trench, at a depth of 

11,034 below sea level.  Oceanic lithosphere moves into trenches at a global rate of about 3 km2/yr.

Trenches are active with earthquakes and resulting tsunamis. Most volcanism associated with trenches occurs on the continent and not on the sea floor. However, many of the ocean's volcanic islands and seamounts are found in what are called island arcs, bending chains of islands rising from the sea floor, usually paralleling the concave edges of an oceanic trench. The western Pacific has island arcism as do the Aleutian Islands.

Near the island of Guam is the famous Mariana Trench where the Pacific Plate descends under the leading edge of the Eurasian Plate. Measured at 36,201 feet - over 6.8 miles (11 km) deep, this trench is the deepest known spot in any ocean. In 1960, two men in the bathyscaph Trieste reached bottom of the Mariana Trench.  

Other extensive trench regions around the world include the South Sandwich Trench between South America and Antarctica, the Peru-Chile Trench, and the Aleutian Trench.

[[North Kosovo]]

CATEGORIES: Kosovo

North  Kosovo is a Serbian enclave  in Kosovo.  It has  over  80,000 residents, at least 98% of them are Christian Serbs. There are about 3,000 Albanians, and about 2000 Turks, Greeks, Gorans, Romas and others.

Unlike the Strpce municipality which is autonomous, North Kosovo is directly run by the Government of Belgrade.

In North Kosovo, Serbian car plates are still used and the Serbian dinar is used as the official currency.

The  enclave consists of the 3 municipalities of Zvecan, Leposavic, Zubin Potok (as well as part of Mitrovica. The enclave's area is 1200 (11% of the country's total area). Lake Gorazdevac is also in the enclave.

The United Nations does not recognize Kosovo as a country because of the 1999 United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244. Other world governing bodies do not recognise it as a country, either.

[[Oviparous animals]]

CATEGORIES: Zoology

Oviparous animals are animals that reproduce by laying eggs. This is how most fish, amphibians, reptiles, insects, and arachnids reproduce. All birds and monotremes also reproduce like this.

The eggs that of most animals that live on land are protected by hard shells. They fertilize their eggs internally. Water-dwelling animals like fish and amphibians lay eggs that have not been fertilized yet. Then the males lay sperm on top of the eggs, which is called external fertilization.

[[Aplacophora]]

CATEGORIES: Molluscs

The Aplacophora is a class of small, deep-water, exclusively benthic, shell-less marine molluscs. They are found in all oceans of the world. They are a small group of molluscs which have deviated from the normal molluscan form. There are approximately 100 known species living today. They are rather worm-like and average about an inch (2.5 cms.) in length.

[[Monoplacophora]]

CATEGORIES: Molluscs

Monoplacophora  is a class of molluscs. They have a cap-like shell and live on the bottom of the sea. 

They were well-known as a fossil group from the Cambrian to the Devonian. One species was dredged up from the Pacific Ocean off Mexico in 1952. It was found to be a Monoplacophoran, and given the genus of Neopilina.  This was one of the most remarkable modern discoveries of a 'living fossil', and a Lazarus taxon. 

More than that, they are the most extreme example of the pull of the recent, which is a term in palaeontology. All fossil groups have a first and last appearance in the fossil record but, for living species, their last appearance is the present day. This may be very much later than their last appearance as a fossil. The discovery of the living monoplacs extended their time range by 400 million years.

The anatomy of Neopilina shows "serially repeated structures" such as gills. Serial repetition of anatomical structures such as gills and muscles may have evolved once in the common ancestor of chitons and monoplacophorans. It suggests the ancient ancestor of molluscs had bilateral symmetry, and segments.

[[Zebra turkeyfish]]

Umkhonto we Sizwe (Spear of the Nation), was a South African guerilla movement created in 1961 by Nelson Mandela, Walter Sisulu and other people from the African National Congress. It was created when the government started killing and hurting people who protested against apartheid. Mandela first wanted to free South Africa without violence, but the government created laws to prevent that. Mandela then decided that if black people did not use violence, they would never regain their rights. They carried out many attacks, including bombings. The most deadly of these was the Church Street bombing in Pretoria. 

Umkhonto we Sizwe stopped being active in 1990 before the end of apartheid, in 1991.

[[Strepsirrhini]]

CATEGORIES: Primates

The Strepsirrhini clade is one of the two suborders of primates, with 114 species. They are defined by their wet noses, although the Greek name means having a curved or bent nose. Madagascar's only primates (apart from humans) are strepsirrhines, although others can be found in southeast Asia.

Their eyes have a reflective layer to improve their night vision, and their eye sockets have a ring of bone around the eye. Strepsirrhine primates produce their own vitamin C, whereas haplorhine primates (and ourselves) must get it from their diets.

The suborder contains the lemurs and lorises. The modern types probably evolved from the Adapiforms, an extinct group.

The origin of the earliest primates, from which both the strepsirrhines and haplorhines (simians and tarsiers) evolved, is a mystery.  Both their place of origin and the group from which they evolved are uncertain.

Although the fossil record of their initial radiation across the Northern Hemisphere is very detailed, the fossil record from the tropics—where primates most likely evolved—is very poor, particularly around the time that primates and other eutherian mammals were first appearing.

So, geneticists and primatologists have used genetic analyses to determine the relatedness between primate lines and when they diverged. Using this molecular clock, it seems that primates evolved more than 80–90 mya, nearly 40 million years before the first primates appear in the fossil record.p22

[[Haplorhini]]

CATEGORIES: Primates

The haplorhines, the "dry-nosed" primates (the Greek name means "simple-nosed"), are members of the Haplorhini clade: the prosimian tarsiers and all of the true simians. The simians are the catarrhines (Old World monkeys and apes, including humans) and the platyrrhines (New World monkeys).

[[Rainbow Serpent]]

CATEGORIES: Australian mythology, Indigenous Australian culture

A Rainbow Serpent is an animal in the Dreamtime which many of the indigenous people of Australia,  the "Aborigines", believe created the mountains, rivers and lakes. The Rainbow Serpent stories are found all across Australia, and especially in Arnhem Land, in the north of Australia. The serpent is known by different names, such as Almudj and Ngalyod, in different Aboriginal languages. The Rainbow Serpent lives in waterholes and controls the supply of water.

Aboriginal artists have painted the Rainbow Serpent on cave walls or on pieces of bark. The earliest cave paintings found are about 8,000 years old. In special ceremonies, they sometimes honour the Rainbow Serpent by painting their handprints on the magic snake.  Scientists believe the Rainbow Serpent stories began at the end of the last ice age. The rising sea levels would have forced a lot of people to move inland. The Rainbow Serpent became a symbol of both creation and destruction, and of unity and peace. This makes the Rainbow Serpent a symbol of the world's oldest continuing religion.

A vector subspace is a vector space that is a subset of another vector space. This means that all the properties of a vector space are satisfied.

Let W be a non empty subset of a vector space V, then, W is a vector subspace if and only if the next 3 conditions are satisfied:

[[Apocalypse]]

CATEGORIES: Christian eschatology, Words

An apocalypse  is a revelation: seeing something which has been hidden. It comes from the Greek word, Apokálypsis, which means "lifting of the veil", or finding out something secret. Often this secret is discovered in a dream or a vision.

In religion, the word describes Armageddon or the end of the world. This might have come from the words, apokalupsis eschaton, meaning all the secrets will be discovered "at the end of the æon, or age". In Christianity The Apocalypse of John is the Book of Revelation, the last book of the Bible. It describes the end of the world, and the second coming of Jesus Christ.

Jeffrey Lionel Dahmer (May 21, 1960 – November 28, 1994) was an American serial killer. He was born in Wisconsin and moved to Ohio in 1966. He murdered young males in Wisconsin and Ohio from 1978-1991. In 1992, he was convicted of 15 murders. Dahmer later confessed to 17 murders in all, dating back to his first victim in 1978. The jury rejected Dahmer's insanity defense, and he was sentenced to 15 life terms (life imprisonment is the maximum penalty that Wisconsin has, but not Ohio, which has the death penalty). He was beaten to death with workout equipment by another inmate, Christopher Scarver, who had been jailed for murder, on the morning of November 28, 1994.  Scarver also killed another inmate, Jesse Anderson, at the same time with the workout equipment.  Anderson had been jailed for murder as well.  They had all been working out together.

Dahmer was diagnosed with three personality disorders: antisocial, borderline and schizotypal.

[[Art history]]

CATEGORIES: Art

Art history is the study of objects of art in their historical development and stylistic contents; that is genre, design, format, and style. The study includes painting, sculpture, architecture, ceramics, furniture and other decorative objects. An art historian is a person who studies the history of art, and then writes about it or teaches about it so that other people can learn about this subject as well.

The first person to become an art historian was Giorgio Vasari. He lived in Florence during the Renaissance, at a time when there were many famous artists alive. Vasari was an artist himself. He decided to write down all the stories that were told in Florence about the many different artists who had made the city famous. He included biographies of several other artists from Northern Italy as well. When all the information was collected and the biographies written, he published them in 1568 in a book called Lives of the Artists. Because of this book, art students today have a lot of information about artists such as Leonardo, Michelangelo, Titian and their works.

[[Dugong]]

CATEGORIES: Sirenia, Mammals of Australia

The dugong (Dugong dugon) is a large mammal that lives its whole life in the sea. 

They are sometimes called "sea cows" as they eat large amounts of sea grass. They live in warm, shallow areas where the sea grass grows. This area includes the north coast of Australia, and in other countries in the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. 

Dugongs are more closely related to elephants than to other sea creatures. Their closest aquatic relative is the manatee, a fresh water species found in America and West Africa.

The dugong can grow to about 3 long and weigh as much as 400. They only come to the surface to breathe, and unlike seals, they never come up on the land. A baby dugong is called a calf. It drinks milk from its mother until about two years old. A dugong reaches its adult size between the ages of 9 and 17 years. The dugong can live for up to 70 years of age. They are grey to brown in color. They have a tail with flukes, like a whale, and flippers. They do not have a dorsal fin like a shark. They have a wide flat nose, small eyes, and small ears.

The dugong is a migratory animal, but very slow moving. Studies by James Cook University showed that while many dugongs traveled less than 15, some went as far as 560. Scientists believe that dugongs move long distances for several reasons. They may be looking for food, as cyclones or floods can affect the seagrass. Males may be following females, or looking for their own territory. If the water gets cold, less than 17 degrees Centigrade, they will travel to warmer areas. 

Because of their size, the only other species to attack dugongs are sharks, the Saltwater Crocodile and killer whales.

[[British Library]]

CATEGORIES: National libraries in Europe, 1973 establishments in Europe, 1970s establishments in England, Libraries in the United Kingdom

The British Library (BL) is the national library of the United Kingdom.  It is on the north side of Euston Road in St Pancras, London, between Euston railway station and St Pancras railway station. The Library is a public institution and is one of the world's largest research libraries. Since 2000 the Chief Executive of the British Library has been Lynne Brindley.

The British Library contains over 170 million items in every language that is known. It has around 25 million books, more than any other library. It has manuscripts and historical items dating back as far as 300 BC. There are books, journals, newspapers, magazines, sound and music recordings, patents, databases, maps, stamps, prints, drawings and much more. 

The British Library, by the law of the United Kingdom, receives copies of every book that is published in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, including all foreign books that are sold in the UK. It also buys many books which are only published outside Britain and Ireland. The British Library adds about three million items to its collection every year. The British Library has about 388 miles (625 km) of shelves.  

==History== 

The British Library, before it got its present name, started out as a group of collections made by several people in the 18th century and then given as part of a national library. The collectors were King George III,  Sir Robert Cotton, Sir Hans Sloane, and Robert Harley. The national library was part of the British Museum and was kept at various places, with some of the most important items always being on public display in the museum. 

The British Library was created in 1973 by the British Library Act 1972.  Since 1997 the main collection has been housed in a single new building on Euston Road next to St. Pancras railway station. In the middle of the building is a four-storey glass tower containing the ‘’King's Library’’, with 65,000 printed volumes along with other pamphlets, manuscripts and maps collected by King George III between 1763 and 1820. 

Not all of the collection is kept in this new building. Part of the collection is at the Document Supply Centre in Yorkshire and all the newspapers from before 1800 are kept at the newspaper library at Colindale, north-west London.

In December 2009 a new storage building at Boston Spa was opened. It cost £26million and will house seven million items, stored in more than 140,000 bar-coded containers, which are retrieved by robots, from the 262 kilometres of temperature- and humidity-controlled storage space.

He had a very big influence in the development of jazz in Britain.  He composed film music and several television theme tunes such as "The Avengers" and "Tomorrow's World".  In his early career he was known as Johnny Dankworth He was the husband of jazz singer Cleo Laine. 

[[Child abandonment]]

CATEGORIES: Child abuse

Child abandonment is when a parent leaves their child. There are many causes of child abandonment, including poverty or mental illness. In many countries, if a children are abandoned, they become orphans and live in an orphanage. They are raised there until they reach 18.

In the United States, "Safe Haven Laws" allow parents to leave their infants at certain safe places.  The goal of these laws is to keep parents from leaving their infants in unsafe places, or killing them.  In some states, leaving a baby at a Safe Haven is thought of as child abandonment, and a complaint may be filed in family court.  But as long as the baby has not been hurt, the parents cannot be charged with a crime for leaving their baby at a Safe Haven.  The baby is given to state child protection workers, who find a safe place for the baby and try to get him or her adopted.  Hospitals, fire stations, and police stations are common Safe Havens.

[[Parazoa]]

CATEGORIES: Biology

Parazoa is the animal sub-kingdom that includes organisms of the phyla Porifera and Placozoa. Sponges are the most well-known parazoa. They are aquatic organisms classified under the phylum Porifera with about 15,000 species worldwide. Although multicellular, sponges only have a few different types of cells, some of which may migrate within the organism to perform different functions.

The three main classes of sponges include glass sponges (Hexactinellida), calcareous sponges (Calcarea), and demosponges (Demospongiae). Parazoa from the phylum Placozoa include the single species Trichoplax adhaerens. These tiny aquatic animals are flat, round, and transparent. They are composed of only four types of cells and have a simple body plan with just three cell layers.

Sponge Parazoa

Sponge parazoans are unique invertebrate animals characterized by porous bodies. This interesting feature allows a sponge to filter food and nutrients from water as it passes through its pores. Sponges can be found at various depths in both marine and freshwater habitats and come in a variety of colors, sizes, and shapes. Some giant sponges can reach heights of seven feet, while the smallest sponges reach heights of only two-thousandths of an inch.

Their varied shapes (tube-like, barrel-like, fan-like, cup-like, branched, and irregular shapes) are structured to provide optimal water flow. This is vital as sponges do not have a circulatory system, respiratory system, digestive system, muscular system, or nervous system as do many other animals. Water circulating through pores allows for gas exchange as well as food filtration. Sponges typically feed on bacteria, algae, and other tiny organisms in water. To a lesser degree, some species have been known to feed on small crustaceans, like krill and shrimp. Since sponges are non-motile, they are typically found attached to rocks or other hard surfaces.

Body Symmetry

Unlike most animal organisms which exhibit some type of body symmetry, such as radial, bilateral, or spherical symmetry, most sponges are asymmetric, exhibiting no type of symmetry. There are a few species, however, that are radially symmetrical. Of all the animal phyla, Porifera are the simplest in form and most closely related to organisms from the kingdom Protista. While sponges are multicellular and their cells perform different functions, they do not form true tissues or organs.

[[Theory of everything]]

CATEGORIES: Nuclear physics, Basic physics ideas

We do not have a theory of everything. It is a hope for the future. The basic concept of the theory of everything is that one theory could explain every aspect of physics.  The four basic forces of nature are gravity, the strong force, the weak force, and the electromagnetic force; the theory of general relativity explains gravity, and quantum mechanics explains the other three forces. Right now, no one theory that everyone accepts can explain all four forces.

String theory is a theory that could become the "theory of everything".

[[Dichotomous key]]

CATEGORIES: Taxonomy

A dichotomous key is a series of questions with only two alternatives. There are only two options at each step. The purpose is to make an identification or to reach a decision. The system has long been used for identifying animals and plants. However, in principle, it can be used for many other tasks, such as fault-finding in complex machinery.

[[KISS (principle)]]

CATEGORIES: Acronyms, Figures of speech

The KISS principle is "Keep It Simple, Stupid". It is an acronym, with the letters KISS making the beginnings of the important words. It was used as a principle for design by the U.S. Navy in 1960. The phrase is said to have been first used by Kelly Johnson, lead engineer at the Lockheed Skunk Works.

There are several variations of the phrase, such as "Keep it short and simple".

[[Linguistic reduction]]

CATEGORIES: Linguistics

Linguistic reductions are lost sounds in words, which happens in spoken English. For instance, "going to" changes to "gonna". The most common reductions are contractions. Most contractions are reductions of 'not'. For instance, "cannot" becomes "can't". Many contractions are reductions between a subject and a verb. For instance, "He is..." becomes "He's..."

Some reductions are known to language learners, such as the reduction of a verb and "to". Examples are "going to" becoming "gonna" and "want to" becoming "wanna".

Linguistic reductions are part of natural English and should not be considered slang or improper.

[[Random sample]]

CATEGORIES: Mathematics, Statistics

A random sample is a sample taken at random from a population of data. 

In a random sample every element in the population has an equal chance of being selected. For instance, to do an election poll, calling people randomly out of the phone book would be better than asking people at a labor union meeting or at a small business convention. A page of the phone book is a more random sample of voters than a union meeting, so the result is more likely to tell who will really be elected. But neither sample is really random because for one thing, some people do not have phones. 

[[Urban contemporary]]

CATEGORIES: Music genres, African-American history

Urban contemporary or urban music is a kind of music played on the radio. It comes from cities. The first person to use this word was the now dead New York DJ Frankie Crocker in the mid 1970s. Urban contemporary radio stations play only hip hop/rap, contemporary R&B, more urban-styled pop, and on occasion, Caribbean music such as reggae and reggaeton. Urban contemporary came from R&B and Soul. Almost all Urban contemporary type radio stations are found in cities that have lots of African-American people. Some cities that have Urban contemporary stations are; Los Angeles, California, New York City, Atlanta, Georgia, Chicago, Fayetteville, North Carolina, Charlotte, and Norfolk, Virginia, etc.

The words "urban contemporary" make people think of African American music, like R&B. For Latino people, the music is more like music from Latin neighborhoods, such as Reggaeton, Hip hop from South America, or bachata.

These stations try to sell their music to African-Americans between the ages of 18 and 34.May 2008 Their playlists are mainly singles by popular hip hop and R&B artists. Sometimes, an urban contemporary station will play classic soul music songs from the '70s and early '80s to make old people happy.

Some radio stations in cities, like KJLH, KMEL, KDAY, and WVEE, will play gospel and Christian R&B/hip-hop music on Sundays.

[[State Senator]]

CATEGORIES: Politics of the United States

A state senator is a member of a state's Senate, the upper house in the bicameral legislature of 49 U.S. states, or a legislator in Nebraska's one house State Legislature.

There are usually fewer state senators than there are members in a state's lower house.  In the past, this meant that senators represented different regions within a state, not according to the population of the region. This was a way of balancing the power of the lower house, where the numbers for each state were related to the state's population.  In 1963, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that state legislatures must give seats in both houses depending on the population of the state.

[[Bicameral]]

CATEGORIES: Legislatures

A Bicameral system of government is one where there are two legislative or parliamentary chambers. The word comes from the Latin "bi" (meaning two) and "camera" (meaning chamber). In most cases they have different numbers of members. The smaller legislature is often called the "upper house" or "senate" and the larger is called the "lower house", and sometimes also called by another name such as "assembly" or "commons". For legislation to be passed, bicameral legislatures normally need a majority of members of both chambers to vote for the legislation.

Experts sometimes point out that often deadlocks occur in this kind of system. This can make it harder to pass laws. But others point out the checks and balances this system maintains. This prevents laws from being passed that favor a certain political faction, the government or group of people.

[[Unicameralism]]

CATEGORIES: Legislatures

In government, unicameralism is when there is only one legislative or parliamentary chambers. Therefore, a unicameral legislature or unicameral parliament is a legislature with one chamber. It comes from the Latin "uni" (meaning one) and "camera" (meaning chamber).

Unicameral legislatures are used around the world. 

Since 1937, the US State of Nebraska’s Nebraska Legislature has been unicameral, however all other US states use a bicameral system.

[[Nebraska Legislature]]

The Nebraska Legislature is the highest legislative body of the U.S. state of Nebraska. It meets at the Nebraska State Capitol in the City of Lincoln in Lancaster County.

Nebraska's Legislature is unusual because it is unicameral. It is also the smallest state legislature in the United States of America, as it only has 49 members.

[[Upper house]]

CATEGORIES: Legislatures

An upper house is one of two chambers of a bicameral legislature. The other chamber is called the lower house.

[[Lower house]]

CATEGORIES: Legislatures

A lower house is one of two chambers of a bicameral legislature. The other chamber is called the upper house.

Although it is called the "lower" house, in many legislatures in the world it actually has more power than the "upper" house.

[[William-Adolphe Bouguereau]]

CATEGORIES: 1825 births, 1905 deaths, French painters

William-Adolphe Bouguereau (born November 30, 1825) was a French painter. Bouguereau was a traditionalist and his style did not change much throughout his painting career. He was a popular artist in his day. Rich customers liked his photo-realistic style. He liked to paint classical scenes and scenes from ancient mythology.

As a boy Bouguereau was born into a family of wine and olive oil sellers. His parents wanted him to join the family business when he became an adult. His uncle, however, arranged for him to get a proper education at school. Bouguereau showed great talent for art. One of his father’s customers talked him into sending William to a famous art college. There he won first place for one of his paintings. To earn extra money he designed labels for fruit jellies and jams.

Bouguereau liked to paint pictures of women. He was known for being able to make his subject look prettier than she really was. 

In 1856, he married Marie-Nelly Monchablon and had five children. In the late 1850s he made a profitable friendship with a successful art dealer. This art dealer made William famous even in other countries. William was able to buy a big house and studio with his growing fortune.

He was a hard working painter. He would make a thorough study and sketch of what he planned to paint. The great way he painted skin, hands and feet was well known. He eventually became a teacher at a French art college. 

Near the end of his life he described his love of his art: “Each day I go to my studio full of joy; in the evening when obliged to stop because of darkness I can scarcely wait for the next morning to come…if I cannot give myself to my dear painting I am miserable”. He painted eight hundred and twenty-six paintings.

Bouguereau died at the age of 79 on August 19, 1905 from heart disease.

The Atari 5200 SuperSystem, or simply the Atari 5200, was a video game console which came out in 1982.  It was made by Atari Inc. and was meant as a replacement to the popular Atari 2600.  Atari wanted the 5200 to compete with the Intellivision, but it competed more closely with the ColecoVision.

The 5200 was based on Atari Inc.'s 400/800 computers.  Even though the internal hardware was almost identical, the code in the software was not.  Design mistakes meant that the 5200 had problems with its use.  These problems made it a market failure.

The Edinburgh International Festival is a festival of music, theatre, opera, dance, visual arts and literature that takes place every year in the city of Edinburgh, Scotland. Each year it is held for about three weeks in late August and early September.

The festival started in 1947. A key person was Rudolf Bing, who was then the manager of the Glyndbourne Opera Festival. Bing was later General Manager of the Metropolitan Opera in New York City from 1950 to 1972. He was naturalized as a British subject in 1946 and knighted in 1971. His idea was to heal the wounds of war through the languages of the arts. Since 2014 the director of the festival has been Fergus Linehan.

At first the Festival concentrated on classical music. Its later events were based on the traditional arts: classical music, ballet, sculpture and fine art. Since 1999 the permanent home of the festival is at The Hub, near Edinburgh Castle. Several large theatres, concert halls and churches in Edinburgh are used for the events, e.g. Usher Hall, Festival Theatre, Edinburgh Playhouse, The Queen's Hall and The Hub. 

About ten other festivals are held in Edinburgh at the same time as the Edinburgh Festival. The result is festivals with more than 2,500 performances and events per day in Edinburgh in August, many times bigger than the next biggest arts festivals anywhere in the world.

2020 is the only year the Festival has not been held. The reason was the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic.

[[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]]

CATEGORIES: Edinburgh, Festivals in the United Kingdom, 1947 establishments in the United Kingdom, 1940s establishments in Scotland

The Edinburgh Festival Fringe (The Fringe) is the world’s largest arts festival.  It started in 1947.  It takes place every year at the same time as the Edinburgh International Festival: late August and early September.  There are hundreds of different events. There are concerts, theatre, opera, and dance and many informal events.

The organisers are the Festival Fringe Society: they publish a programme every year, sell tickets and give advice to performers from the Fringe office on the Royal Mile.

The Edinburgh Festival itself is recognised to offer high-quality events. However, the Fringe events are variable, and entry has no real quality barriers. It is largely an open event where almost any theatrical or show event can be performed. Its lack of supervision means the shows are of unpredictable standard. All events have an entrance charge, which is reasonable because theatres do charge performers.

[[Protea]]

CATEGORIES: Proteaceae

The Protea (giant Protea known as Protea cynaroides) is part of an ancient plant family, the Proteaceae, which had already divided into two subfamilies before the break-up of the Gondwanaland continent about 140 million years ago. Both subfamilies, the Proteoideae and the Grevilleoideae, occur mainly in the southern hemisphere. In southern Africa there are about 360 species, mainly from the subfamily Proteoideae, of which more than 330 species are confined to the Cape Foral Kingdom, between Nieuwoudtville in the northwest and Grahamstown in the east. Protea cynaroides belongs to the genus Protea, which has more than 92 species, subspecies and varieties. Other well-known genera of the Proteaceae are the Leucospermum with the brightly coloured "pincushion" flowers, Leucadendron with yellow or red-brown foliage and Serruria, of which the Serruria Florida or "Blushing Bride" with its pale pink flowers is widely used in bridal bouquets. Plants in the subfamily Grevilleoideae occur mainly in Australia. The Protea (Protea cynaroides) is the national flower of South Africa.

The variety in plant size, habit, flower size and colour of the genus Protea was the reason it was named after the Greek god Proteus, who could change his shape at will. The flower bud of Protea cynaroides looks remarkably like the globe artichoke vegetable with the Latin name of Cynara scolymus and this led the botanist Linnaeus to give it the species name cynaroides.

[[Oligosaccharide]]

CATEGORIES: Carbohydrates

An oligosaccharide is a polymer of a few different simple sugars. Oligosacchardides are carbohydrates. When they are hydrolized, oligosaccharides give 3 to 10 monosaccharides.

Oligosacharides are formed when 3 to 10 monosaccharide units combine with each other by the loss of water molecules, resulting in the formation of a glycosidic linkage. Conversely hydrolysis of an oligosaccharide in water in the presence of an acid or enzyme yields 3 to 10 monosaccharide units. Oligosaccharides which consist of two monosaccharides units are called as disaccharide. Oligosaccharides containing 3 monosaccharides are called trisaccharides.

The site was inhabited the during the Preclassic and Classic periods, from the 9th century BC through to at least the 10th century AD. It was an important place for trade. It traded with Kaminaljuyu and Chocolá. It is one of the largest sites with carved monuments on the Pacific coast. Olmec-style sculptures include a possible colossal head, rock carvings and others. The site has one of the biggest collections of Olmec-style sculpture outside of the Gulf of Mexico.

Takalik Abaj shows the first signs of Maya culture that happened by about 400 BC. The site includes a Maya royal tomb and examples of Maya writing that are among the first from the Maya region. Studies continue at the site; the monumental buildings and long tradition of sculpture in a variety of styles suggest the site was important.

Finds from the site indicate contact with the distant city of Teotihuacan in the Valley of Mexico. They imply that Takalik Abaj was conquered by it or its allies. Takalik Abaj was linked to long-distance Maya trade routes that let the city take part in a trade network that included the Guatemalan highlands and the Pacific coastal plain from Mexico to El Salvador.

Takalik Abaj was a large city with the main buildings in four main groups spread across nine terraces. While some of these were natural, others were man-made, needing a lot of work and materials. The site had a clever water drainage system and many stone sculptures.

Daniel Johnston (January 22, 1961 – September 11, 2019) was an American songwriter, singer, and artist who lived in Texas. Johnston has bipolar disorder. The movie The Devil and Daniel Johnston is about his life and music career.

Born in Sacramento, California, Johnston grew up in West Virginia in a Christian family. He became a Beatles fan when he was young, then went off to college but did not finish. He moved to Texas to live with his brother, and ended up joining a circus. He left the circus after another worker beat him up for taking too long in a restroom, and found a church in Austin, Texas that helped him find somewhere to live. Johnston's religious beliefs are mentioned in many of his songs, especially on his CD 1990.

Johnston's music career started in Austin in the 1980s. He made cassette tapes of songs he performed on a chord organ and gave many of them out for free to people he met. He started playing concerts and became very popular with music fans in Texas. Johnston appeared on MTV, and became even more popular when Nirvana singer Kurt Cobain wore a T-shirt with the cover art of one of Johnston's CDs.

Johnston released one CD on Atlantic Records, a major record label (a big company that helps make CDs and sells them around the world) called Fun in 1994. However, he was not able to make any more CDs with Atlantic Records because not enough people bought Fun. However, Johnston still writes songs, and his drawings appear on the covers of his CDs. His latest CD is Is and Always Was, which came out in 2009.

[[Cluster (computing)]]

CATEGORIES: Computing

In computing, a cluster is made of many individual computers that work together to solve a problem at hand. Clusters can have different forms: They can be whole computers working together, or only CPUs. These CPUs can communicate over a fast network, but they share the same hard disks, for example. Depending on the problem, solving it with a cluster of cheaper components can be less expensive that investing in better hardware that costs more.

Grid computing is different in that the individual computers work on separate tasks that are part of a large problem. They are usually more different from one another and geographically further apart than cluster computers are.

Garry Kasparov (born 13 April 1963 in Baku, Azerbaijan) is a Russian chess grandmaster and political activist. He was born with the name Garry Weinstein, and is partly of Jewish descent. He was the World Chess Champion from 1985 to 2000. In 1993 he broke away from FIDE to make a rival organisation (the PCA), because he felt FIDE had failed to raise enough money for world title matches. There is controversy about that period. By any measure, he is one of the greatest chess players of all time, and the highest-rated player before Magnus Carlsen.

Kasparov became the youngest non-disputed World Chess Champion in 1985 at the age of 22. He held the official FIDE world title until 1993, when an argument with FIDE led him to set up a rival company, the Professional Chess Association. He continued to hold the "Classical" World Chess Championship until his defeat by Vladimir Kramnik in 2000. Kasparov lost a match (a series of chess games) against Deep Blue, a computer made by IBM, in 1997. Lately, retired from competition, he has been coaching Magnus Carlsen, the young player from Norway who is the current world #1.

[[Economic bubble]]

CATEGORIES: Financial crises

An economic bubble happens when a market goes through a very fast inflation of value. This increase is followed by a quick decrease in value, called a "crash" or a "bubble burst". Economic bubbles can be caused by many things, but many economists believe that economic bubbles are related to inflation. An economic bubble can cause an economic crisis due to a loss of investment both by companies and individuals, such as the Great Depression or the Economic crisis of 2007-2010.

An economic bubble occurs due to the human psychology of an expectation of an unlimited demand for any particular commodity. The market moves up quickly as the investors see an increase in prices due to increase in demand. Prices may eventually fall when supply increases beyond the demand, resulting in the bursting of the bubble. Predicting when this will happen is difficult, hence it may surprise investors.

[[Population without double counting]]

CATEGORIES: Statistics

Population sans doubles comptes is a phrase in French that means population without double counting in English.

In France, because of the census, the INSEE has allowed people who live in one place and study in a different place to be counted twice, so as to show how the population moves. Because of this, each commune in France has many numbers of how many people live in it. For example, students may be counted where they study and where they live but do not study (the place they were born in). It is just like allowing students in the United States to vote in the town election of the place they are studying in and the town election where they were born.

[[Glass transition]]

CATEGORIES: Polymer chemistry, Thermodynamics

The glass transition is the transition of amorphous solids from a hard and brittle state into a molten or rubber-like state. An amorphous solid that goes through a glass transition is called a glass. Supercooling a viscous liquid into the glass state is called vitrification.

The glass transition temperature Tg is always lower than the melting temperature, Tm, of the crystalline state of the material, if one exists. Above a glass transition temperature, a plastic is rubbery. Below the glass transition temperature, a plastic is solid. Thermosets, or thermo-setting plastics, burn up before they reach their melt temperature, but most thermosets also undergo glass transition.

The Rugby Championship is an annual rugby union competition between the national teams of the sport's four strongest Southern Hemisphere nations—New Zealand, Australia, South Africa, and Argentina. It began in 1996, a year after the sport became professional, as the Tri Nations. At the time, New Zealand, Australia, and South Africa competed for the Tri Nations Trophy. Beginning in 2012, Argentina joined the competition.

During the Tri Nations era, the contest began in July, during the Southern Hemisphere winter, and ran through September. For most of that era, each team played every other team twice, once at home and once away. Later on, each team played the others three times. When the competition added Argentina, it returned to a pure home-and-away format, with a total of 12 games played. Also, due to a slight change in the sport's calendar, The Rugby Championship now begins in August and runs through October. This format is used except in years in which the Rugby World Cup is played (every four years, in the year before the Summer Olympics). In those years, each team plays the others only once, with a total of six games played.

Teams are awarded competition points for a win, but can also earn 'bonus' points. At the end of the series, the team with the most competition points wins the trophy. The team that wins the competition is usually considered to be the best rugby union team in the Southern Hemisphere for that year.

[[Porridge]]

CATEGORIES: Breakfast foods

Porridge is a food which is made with a cereal, usually oats.  The oats are boiled in water or milk, or both. It is usually served hot in a bowl or dish.  Some people add things to their porridge such as sugar or syrup. In Scotland salt is often added.

Porridge is a traditional food in many countries in Northern Europe.  It is usually eaten for breakfast.  In some countries barley or other grains may be used.  Porridge is cooked in saucepans or in a microwave.  Traditionally, it was cooked in large metal kettles over hot coals. Porridge was often served as food for prisoners in prisons.  This is why in English there is a slang expression "doing porridge" which means "being in prison". Porridge is also given to people who are ill because it is nourishing and  easy to eat.

Semolina and gruel are foods which are quite similar to porridge. Semolina is usually served as a pudding. Gruel is a similar but thinner concoction to porridge. It is semi-liquid and usually drunk rather than eaten. Oliver Twist, in the famous book by Charles Dickens, was given gruel to eat.

Historically, heavy foods were eaten because most work was manual. Before the industrial revolution, men and women doing hard work needed more calories per day than they need today. At any rate this applies to countries which are highly mechanized. Porridge is a good example of the heavy calorie-laden food which has gradually gone out of favour.

[[Fresnel lens]]

A Fresnel lens is an optical lens, which was originally developed for Lighthouses. It is named after its inventor, French physicist Augustin-Jean Fresnel. The name is pronounced  /freɪˈnɛl/ (fray-NELL), the 's' is silent. Before Fresnel,  Buffon and Condorcet proposed a similar design, as a way to make large burning lenses.  

The design allows the construction of lenses of large aperture and short focal length without the weight and volume of material that would be required in conventional lens design.  Compared to earlier lenses, the Fresnel lens is much thinner. More light can pass through. Lighthouses that use these kind of lenses can be seen from farther away.

Wagner conducted the first performance at the Semper Oper in Dresden, in 1843.  It is an early opera of Wagner, but it shows his mature style.  It is very different from the previous opera Rienzi which is still quite similar to operas that other composers were writing.  In Der fliegende Holländer the drama is very important.  Wagner uses a number of leitmotifs: musical ideas associated with particular characters and themes in the story. The leitmotifs are all introduced in the overture.  We hear the famous leitmotif of the ocean and then those of the Dutchman and of Senta, the girl he falls in love with.

[[Continuous function]]

CATEGORIES: Mathematics

A mathematical function is called continuous if, roughly said, a small change in the input only causes a small change in the output. If this is not the case, the function is discontinuous.  Functions defined on the real numbers, with one input and one output variable, will show as an uninterrupted line (or curve). They can be drawn without lifting the pen off of the page. The definition given above was made by Augustin-Louis Cauchy.

A basic way to know if a function is continuous is to use a pencil or your finger. Then, start at the left of the function. Then, move your finger along the path of the function. If you ever need to lift your finger or pencil to keep following the function, then you know it is not continuous. This is because, by lifting your finger, you have "jumped" from one section of the function to another. That means you made a very small movement but the function changed very much. This is what the first sentence of this article is talking about.

[[Fulgurite]]

CATEGORIES: Natural materials, Glass

Fulgurites are a rare type of natural glass made when lightning hits silica-rich minerals that are commonly in sand, soil, and some rocks. Tubular fulgurites are found in places with a lot of silica, like beaches or deserts. Lightning makes a tubular fulgurite when a bolt goes through the sand and melts silica into a liquid. The liquid silica cools and hardens quickly, leaving behind a thin glassy tube, usually with a rough outer surface and a smooth inner surface. Underground, a fulgurite may be shaped like the roots of a tree, branching out with many arms that trace the zigzagging path of the lightning bolt. They are quite delicate, with walls no thicker than 1-2 mm. Some of the largest fulgurites are removed from the ground in many pieces and then glued back into their original shape.

[[Boomslang]]

CATEGORIES: Venomous animals, Colubrids

A boomslang (Dispholidus typus)  is a large venomous snake found in sub-Saharan Africa. Its name means "tree snake" in Dutch and Afrikaans. It is a colubrid, the largest family of snakes, found on every continent except Antarctica.

Boomslangs eat small animals like chameleons, frogs, and birds, and they also eat eggs. Like all snakes, boomslangs do not chew  they swallow everything whole.

The venom of boomslangs can disrupt the clotting of blood, and this can kill a person. After a bite, one can sometimes feel a headache, nausea and sleepiness. This does not happen often, as boomslangs only bite humans when they feel attacked. 

Its eyes are large in proportion to its head; they have binocular vision that helps them spot their prey.  Its scientific name is Dispholidus typus. A boomslang is a slender snake with large eyes on a large blunt head. The snake can grow to up to 2 meters long, but is on average about 1 to 1.6 m in length.

[[Fire engine]]

CATEGORIES: Firefighting, Springfield, Massachusetts

A fire engine is a vehicle that is designed to help in fighting fires. A fire engine carries hoses, a pump, a water tank and breathing equipment. It will also have rescue equipment, such as ladders, ropes and cutting tools, and usually first aid kits as well. A fire engine brings firefighters to the scene from the fire station. It will also have sirens and flashing lights to warn traffic along the way.

In the Middle Ages, the only way to fight a fire was with buckets of water. In the 16th century, hand-powered pumps were invented. In the 19th century, the design of these pumps was improved, so that horses could wheel them to the scene. Later, steam power was used to turn both the pumps and the wheels. The first modern fire engine was invented in 1905 by Knox Automobile in Springfield, Massachusetts.

Special types of fire service vehicles include:

[[Phase change]]

CATEGORIES: Chemistry, Physics

A phase change is a change in the states of matter.  For example, a solid may become a liquid. This phase change is called melting.  When a solid changes into a gas, it is called sublimation. When a gas changes into a liquid, it is called condensation. When a liquid changes into a solid, it is called solidification. When a gas changes into a solid, it is called deposition . When a liquid changes into gas, it is called evaporation. Phase changes are usually caused by changes in temperature or pressure.

As the states of matter change from solid to liquid to gas, respectively, their composition changes as well. For example, in a solid, the bonds are stronger than hydrogen bonds. That allows the solid substance to have a definite volume and shape. However, when the heat is added to the solid and it melts to become a liquid, the bonds are considerably weaker, and in water, are simply hydrogen bonds.  A liquid has a definite volume but not a definite shape, and it thus takes the shape of the container in which it is. When more heat is added, the liquid substance evaporates and becomes a gas, which has no bonds at all. Gas is simply a formless collection of particles that tends to expand in all directions at the same time in order to occupy its full container. If a gas is not confined, the space between the particles will continue to increase. A gas has neither a definite volume nor a definite shape. 

In this pattern, solid to liquid to gas, heat is being added in order to provoke the phase change. In the other "direction," gas to liquid to solid, heat is being released through the phase change. 

It often helps to think of an ice cube when thinking of phase changes. An ice cube is a solid, and when heated up, it becomes liquid water. When heated up some more, it becomes water vapor, which is a gas.

But Leeroy is not around for the explanation, preparing some chicken, and when he comes back, he ends up running in the area, shouting his own name as he goes, which begins the activity, and ruining the plan which his friends made. This causes everyone to panic, and no-one knows what to do, and so, everyone dies. Everyone blames Leeroy for this, and he says "At least I got chicken."

Leeroy has become very well known and his name is now used by people to show that they are running in but have no idea what to do. These people should be avoided, as they may cause you to die as well, as the video shows. Because of this, people now consider the video to be a lesson.

[[A minor]]

CATEGORIES: Minor scales

A minor (usually shortened to Am) is a minor scale based on A, which is made up of the pitches A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and A.  The harmonic minor scale raises the G to Gsharp. Its key signature has no sharps or flats (see below: Scales and keys).

Its relative major is C major, and its parallel major is A major. A scale in both A minor and C major can be played on a piano or other keyboard instrument using only the white keys.

Changes needed for the melodic and harmonic versions of the scale are written in with accidentals when needed.

Most of the time key signatures were cancelled whenever the new key signature had fewer sharps or flats than the old key signature, in modern popular music, this is only done when C major or A minor replace another key.

[[Decision theory]]

CATEGORIES: Mathematics

Decision theory is a mathematical theory about how to best reach a decision. This is done using probability theory, statistics and logical reasoning. A decision can be made in different ways. Decision theory usually picks the best decision by looking at the consequences each way to decide might have. 

In most cases, decision theory is normative and prescriptive. Most of the time, it assumes the decision maker has perfect knowledge. Decision makers know all the consequences, and case take the best pick. 

There are three branches of decision theory:

CATEGORIES: Ethnic groups in Asia, History of China, Nomadic people, 3rd-century BC establishments, 5th-century disestablishments

The Xiongnu (匈奴) were nomads who lived north of China from about 3rd century BC to 460s AD. Their lands were very infertile, so they tried to attack China many times. As this was very irritating, the first emperor of China (Qin Shi Huang) built the Great Wall of China around 214 to 206 BC to keep them out. Some Han dynasty emperors tried to stop the wars and make friends with them, but they still tried to attack the Chinese borders.

At first, it was believed that they were related to the Huns, and currently many people still believe this. In old times, nomadic tribes often travelled and lived together, even tribes speaking different languages. Around 60 BC, there was a struggle for power, and the Xiongnu broke up into five smaller tribes.

In 202 AD, the leader of the Southern Xiongnu surrendered to Prime Minister Cao Cao of the Han dynasty.

They are part of the Mongolian people now, or some of them have migrated to China for a better life.

[[Litmus paper]]

CATEGORIES: Chemical compounds, Analytical chemistry, Physical chemistry

Litmus paper is a mixture which is made from different dyes which can be taken from lichens. It is water-soluble. It is used to tell whether a solution is an acid or an alkali.

Litmus paper is put onto filter paper. The paper can then be used to give a rough indication of the pH value of a solution. Blue litmus paper will turn red, when acid is present; red litmus paper will turn blue when alkalines are present. At room temperature, this usually happens for PH values between 4.5 and 8.3.

Alternatively, a solution can be prepared which works the same way, but does not need the paper.

He went to an all-boys high school and then later studied at two art colleges, one in Louisiana and one in California. He later trained in New York. He began by painting outdoor scenes at family gatherings, using an oak tree as his main subject in hundreds of paintings. Later he started abstract painting of Louisiana legends and the history of its people. 

He is best known for his Blue Dog series of paintings. He modeled the Blue Dog after his own pet named Tiffany. She had died a couple years before the first painting was ever made. That first painting was made for the cover of a scary book. It was a little eerie, the subject being a pale scruffy dog with red eyes. Eventually they became friendlier images of the Blue Dog. He died of prostate cancer on December 14, 2013, aged 69.

[[Fashion in the 15th century]]

CATEGORIES: Fashion, 15th century

Fashion in the 15th century, in Europe was characterized by a series of extremes and extravagances, from the voluminous gowns called houppelandes with their sweeping floor-length sleeves to the revealing doublets and hose of Renaissance Italy. Hats, hoods, and other headdresses assumed increasing importance, and were swagged, draped, jewelled, and feathered. Full-bodied houppelandes with voluminous sleeves worn with elaborate headdresses are characteristic of the earlier 15th century.

As Europe continued to grow more prosperous, the urban middle classes, skilled workers, began to wear more complex clothes that followed, at a distance, the fashions set by the elites. National variations in clothing seem on the whole to have increased over the century. 

Wool was the most popular fabric for all classes by far, followed by linen and hemp. Wool fabrics were available in a wide range of qualities, from rough undyed cloth to fine, dense broadcloth with a velvety nap; high-value broadcloth was a backbone of the English economy and was exported throughout Europe. Wool fabrics were dyed in rich colours, notably reds, greens, golds, and blues, although the actual blue colour achievable with dyeing with woad (and less frequently indigo) could not match the characteristic rich lapis lazuli pigment blues depicted in contemporary illuminated manuscripts such as the Très Riches Heures du duc de Berry.

Silk-weaving was well-established around the Mediterranean by the beginning of the century, and figured silks, often silk velvets with silver-gilt wefts, are increasingly seen in Italian dress and in the dress of the rich throughout Europe. Stately floral designs featuring a pomegranate or artichoke motif had reached Europe from China in the previous century and became a dominant design in the Ottoman silk-producing cities of Istanbul and Bursa, and spread to silk weavers in Florence, Genoa, Venice, Valencia and Seville in this period. 

Fur was worn, mostly as a lining layer, by those who could afford it. The grey and white squirrel furs of the Middle Ages, vair and miniver, went out of style except at court, first for men and then for women; the new fashionable furs were dark brown sable and marten. Toward the end of the century, wild animal furs such as lynx became popular. Ermine remained the prerogative and hallmark of royalty.

[[Markov chain]]

CATEGORIES: Mathematics, Statistics

A Markov chain is a model of some random process that happens over time. Markov chains are called that because they follow a rule called the Markov property. The Markov property says that whatever happens next in a process only depends on how it is right now (the state). It doesn't have a "memory" of how it was before. It is helpful to think of a Markov chain as evolving through discrete steps in time, although the "step" doesn't need to have anything to do with time.

Markov chains can be discrete or continuous. Discrete Time Markov Chains are split up into discrete time steps, like t = 1, t = 2, t = 3, and so on. The probability that a chain will go from one state to another state depends only on the state that it's in right now. Continuous Time Markov Chains are chains where the time spent in each state is a real number. The amount of time the chain stays in a certain state is randomly picked from an exponential distribution, which basically means there's an average time a chain will stay in some state, plus or minus some random variation.

An example of a Markov chain are the dietary habits of a creature who only eats grapes, cheese or lettuce, and whose dietary habits conform to the following (artificial) rules:

This creature's eating habits can be modeled with a Markov chain since its choice depends on what it ate yesterday, not additionally on what it ate 2 or 3 (or 4, etc...) days ago. One statistical property one could calculate is the expected percentage of the time the creature will eat cheese over a long period.

Another classical example of a Markov chain is the 1995 model of cocaine use in Los Angeles designed by the RAND Corporation. The model is governed by a series of equations, which describe the probability of a person being a non-user, light user (L) or heavy user (H) of cocaine at time t+1, given their prior probabilities at time t:

L(t+1) = I(t)-aL(t) +fH(t)-bL(t)

H(t+1) = bL(t)-fH(t)-gH(t)

I(t)+L(t)+H(t)=1

[[Mary Anning]]

CATEGORIES: 1799 births, 1847 deaths, British biologists, Fossils, People from Dorset, Female scientists, British palaeontologists

Mary Anning (21 May 1799 – 9 March 1847) was an early 19th-century British fossil collector, dealer and paleontologist. She earned her living finding and preparing fossils, in the rich Jurassic marine strata at Lyme Regis, Dorset where she lived. She made many important finds. These included the first ichthyosaur skeleton to be correctly identified (Temnodontosaurus platyodon); the first two plesiosaur skeletons ever found (Plesiosaurus dolichodeirus); the first pterosaur skeleton found outside Germany (Dimorphodon macronyx); and some important fish fossils.

Her observations played a key role in the discoveries that belemnite fossils contained fossilized ink sacs, and that coprolites, known as bezoar stones at the time, were fossilized faeces. When the geologist Henry De la Beche painted Duria Antiquior, he based it largely on fossils Anning had found. He sold prints for her benefit. Her work played a key role in the growth of scientific biology in the early 19th century. It showed without question that previously unknown forms of life had existed in the Jurassic seas, all of which were long extinct.

Anning's sex and social class—her parents were poor religious dissenters (non-Anglican Protestants)—prevented her from fully participating in the scientific community of early 19th century England, dominated as it was by rich Anglican gentlemen. Some of the men she worked with and for did give her full credit for her contributions, but some did not.

Although she became well known in geological circles in Britain, Europe, and America, and she made a great deal of money from her best finds, she struggled financially for much of her life. In 1818 Anning came to the attention of Thomas Birch, a rich fossil collector, when she sold him an ichthyosaur skeleton. A year later, he was disturbed by the poverty of the Anning family, which was at the point of having to sell their furniture to make ends meet. Birch arranged for the sale by auction of his own fossil collection, and the proceeds (some £400) were given to the Annings. Besides providing much needed funds, the public auction raised the profile of the Anning family in the geologic community. Later, she lost £300 (a huge sum) in 1835 on unwise investments, but was saved by a government pension of £25 per year. This was organised by another of her friends, William Buckland. Her early death was caused by breast cancer.

[[Cyberbullying]]

CATEGORIES: Types of crime, Bullying

Cyberbullying is the misuse of electronic information and mass media, such as e-mail, SMS, weblogs, cellphones and defamatory websites, to harass or attack a person or a group. It can cause emotional damage. Cyberbullying” was first used in 1998. Cyberbullying can include sending threats and unwanted sexual messages. It is repeated behaviour, aimed at scaring, angering or shaming those who are targeted. Examples include: spreading lies about or posting embarrassing photos of someone on social media, sending hurtful messages or threats via messaging platforms, impersonating someone and sending mean messages to others on their behalf. Face-to-face bullying and cyberbullying can often happen alongside each other. But cyberbullying leaves a digital footprint – a record that can prove useful and provide evidence to help stop the abuse.

The prevalence of cyberbullying is shocking, especially for youth: Over 59% of teenagers in the US have experienced cyberbullying, and globally 33% of parents report having or knowing a child within their community who had been cyberbullied. Cyberbullying is not only limited to children and teenagers however. 41% of adults in the US report having personally experienced online harassment, with 66% reporting that they have seen this negative behavior directed at others. High profile cases of celebrities being harassed online often end up on the news.

Some schools have started programs to teach students about cyberbullying and how to deal with it.

[[Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis]]

CATEGORIES: Compositions by Johann Sebastian Bach

Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis (BWV) is a list of all the pieces of music by Johann Sebastian Bach that are known.  In English it means Bach Works Catalogue.

The catalogue was made by Wolfgang Schmieder in 1950.  He took all the music that is known by Johann Sebastian Bach (some of Bach's music has been lost) and gave each piece a number.  Each piece of music by Bach therefore has a BWV number.   For example, the Mass in B minor is BWV 232.  Giving each piece a number helps musicians to know exactly which piece of music we are talking about.  For example, there are several Preludes and Fugues in G major, but putting Prelude and Fugue in G major BWV550 makes it clear which one it is.

The BWV numbers are not listed chronologically (in the order they were written).  They are grouped according to what kind of music it is: all the cantatas together, all the concertos together, etc.

Some pieces of music may be written by Bach, but we are not sure.  Those doubtful pieces of music are listed separately as BWV Anhang (BWV appendix).  Some of what Schmieder wrote in 1950 has been updated because some new music by Bach has been discovered.  Other pieces of music have now been proved not to be by Bach.

Bach, like many composers from long ago, did not use opus numbers, because very few of his works were published during his lifetime.

Some older books write "S" instead of "BWV" (S for Schmieder), but Schmieder did not want this.  He wanted Bach's name to be used, not his own.

[[Holodomor]]

CATEGORIES: 1932, 1933, 1930s in Europe, 1930s in the Soviet Union, 20th century in Ukraine, Genocide, Hunger

The Holodomor (Голодомор, which means "murder by hunger") was a man-made famine that happened in Ukraine in 1932 and in 1933. At that time, Ukraine was a part of the Soviet Union. About seven million people starved to death in the Holodomor.

Joseph Stalin was the leader and dictator of the Soviet Union, which was a communist country. He made farmers in the Soviet Union change the way they farmed, then he tried to make the farmers work harder for the government-owned farms, for less money. Many people in the Ukraine did not want to go along with this. When the Ukraine had a famine, Stalin refused to help the people in the Ukraine. Instead, the government took food away from people. It became illegal (against the law) to pick up food from the ground of fields. The government also tried to stop people from moving around the country to look for food.

Scholars and politicians using the word Holodomor say the man-made aspects of the famine, was  a genocide; some consider the huge loss of life comparable to the Holocaust. They argue that the Soviet policies were an attack on the rise of Ukrainian nationalism and therefore is a genocide.

Other scholars say that the Holodomor was an unexpected consequence of the rapid and massive industrialization started by Stalin, that brought radical economic changes to the farmers and the country, and which was not done on purpose.

It is a cognitive bias in which a person overestimates the "agreement grade" that the other people have with them. In other words, people tend to think that others agree with them. Most of the time, a person thinks that their own attitudes, beliefs, values and habits are the most common ones. In reality, the person's thoughts may not be shared by others.  

Another effect which can occur with false consensus is called pluralistic ignorance. In pluralistic ignorance, people support a norm or a belief in public, even though they really think it is wrong.

[[Eudimorphodon]]

CATEGORIES: Pterosaurs

Eudimorphodon is a recently discovered pterosaur, and comes from shale laid down Upper Triassic rocks in Italy.

A nearly complete skeleton was found in 1973. This showed it was a member of the long-tailed sub-order of pterosaurs, the Rhamphorhynchoidea. Eudimorphodon was small in size, with 110 teeth packed into a jaw only 6 cms long. Teeth at the front are fangs, further back the teeth are small and multipointed, many with five cusps. This is unique among pterosaurs, whose teeth are usually of a simple conical form.

Stomach contents showed it had eaten a small fish, Parapholidophorus. The top and bottom teeth of Eudimorphodon came into direct contact with each other when the jaws were closed, especially at the back of the jaw. The teeth were multi-cusped, and tooth wear shows that Eudimorphodon was able to crush or chew its food to some degree. Wear along the sides of these teeth suggests that Eudimorphodon also fed on hard-shelled invertebrates.

Juvenile Eudimorphodon had somewhat different and fewer teeth, and may have eaten insects.

An unsolved puzzle is the flexibility of the tail, which lacks the very long stiffening vertebral extensions other long-tailed pterosaurs have. This flexibility is a basal trait; its functional significance in this genus is unknown. However, it is known that the stiffened tail of Rhamphorhynchus-like pterosaurs is a device which adds stability to their flight. Without this stability, the animal would be more manoeuvrable, but their flight would need more control by the brain.

[[Epicureanism]]

CATEGORIES: Philosophical movements and positions

Epicureanism is a philosophy based on the teachings of Epicurus. It started about 307BC. Epicurus was a materialist who believed that material was made of atoms. The teaching about atoms was first started by Democritus. 

Epicurus forcefully attacked superstition. According to Epicurus, the gods are passive: They do not intervene in the world. According to Aristippus, Epicurus believed that the greatest good was to have certain pleasures, and to reach a state of mind where there is no fear and no pain. Epicureanism is a form of hedonism, which declares that pleasure is the only good there is. Epicureanism says that the absence of pain is the greatest pleasure; it also advocates a simple life. These ideas make it sufficiently different from "hedonism" as it is usually defined.

In the Epicurean view, the highest pleasure (tranquility and freedom from fear) was obtained by knowledge, friendship and living a virtuous and temperate life. Epicurus spoke favorably about the enjoyment of simple pleasures; He also meant abstaining from bodily desires, such as sex and appetites, almost like asceticism. 

He argued that when eating, one should not eat too richly, for it could lead to dissatisfaction later, such as the grim realization that one could not afford such delicacies in the future. Likewise, sex could lead to increased lust and dissatisfaction with the sexual partner. Epicurus did not articulate a broad system of social morality that has survived.

Epicureanism was originally a challenge to Platonism, though later it became the main opponent of Stoicism. Epicurus and his followers shunned politics. Many Epicurean societies flourished in the late Hellenistic perod and during the Roman era (such as those in Antiochia, Alexandria, Rhodes and Ercolano). 

The poet Lucretius was its best-known Roman proponent. By the end of the Roman Empire, having undergone Christian attack and repression, Epicureanism had all but died out, but was resurrected in the 17th century by the atomist Pierre Gassendi, who adapted it to the Christian doctrine.

Some writings by Epicurus have survived. Some scholars consider the epic poem On the Nature of Things by Lucretius presents in one work the core arguments and theories of Epicureanism. Many of the papyrus scrolls unearthed at the Villa of the Papyri at Herculaneum are Epicurean texts. At least some are thought to have belonged to the Epicurean Philodemus.

Wakefield prepared meals and desserts. One day she was without Baker's Chocolate for a butter drop cookie recipe. She cut a Nestlé's semi-sweet chocolate bar into bits and added the bits to the dough, thinking the pieces would melt as the cookie baked. The bits did not melt completely, but they did soften. The result was called the Toll House Cookie. Nestlé printed the recipe on its packages of chocolate. Wakefield received a lifetime supply of Nestlé semi-sweet chocolate for her permission to print the recipe.

[[Lazarus taxon]]

CATEGORIES: Extinction events, Paleontology

In paleontology, a Lazarus taxon (plural taxa) is a taxon that disappears from one or more periods of the fossil record, only to appear again later. The term refers to the Gospel of John, in which Jesus is claimed to have raised Lazarus from the dead. Lazarus taxa occur either because of (local) extinction, later resupplied, or as a sampling artifact. The fossil record is imperfect (only a very small fraction of organisms become fossilized) and contains gaps not necessarily caused by extinction, particularly when the number of individuals in a taxon becomes very low.

The concept was developed in palaeontology where, after a major extinction event, some groups reappear after millions of years. The usual explanation is that numbers were driven so low that their chance of fossilisation were extremely low. Then, gradually, their numbers revived.

The 2010 Cauquenes earthquake  was an earthquake that happened off the coast of Maule region of Chile, near Cauquenes, on February 27, 2010, at 3:34 local time (6:34 UTC). It is said to have lasted between ten and thirty seconds. At first, its magnitude was reported to be between 8.3 and 8.5 on the Moment magnitude scale, but this was later corrected upwards, to be at 8.8 of that scale. It was the strongest earthquake in Chile since the magnitude 9.5 1960 Valdivia earthquake, and the strongest earthquake worldwide since the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake.

The epicenter of the earthquake was offshore from the Maule Region, approximately 8 km west of Curanipe and 115 km north-northeast of Chile's second largest city, Concepción. Also, the epicenter is less than 20 km due east from that of the 1960 Valdivia earthquake. Other cities exposed to Mercalli intensity scale intensity VIII (Destructive) shaking were Arauco, Lota and Constitución.

The earthquake was also felt in the Chilean capital Santiago as well as in some Argentinean cities. Tsunami warnings were issued in 53 countries. Michelle Bachelet, President of Chile, declared a "state of catastrophe". She also confirmed the deaths of at least 795 people.

Chile was hit by another earthquake in March 11, 2010, with epicenter in the coastern town of Pichilemu, Province of Cardenal Caro, almost 200 kilometers from Santiago de Chile. It was MW 6,9 in the Richter scale.

[[Wigger]]

CATEGORIES: Pejoratives, English profanity

The term wigger means a person who by act does things that stereotypically are related to urban African Americans, Black British and Caribbean culture, especially in relation to hip hop culture and British Grime/Garage scene.  The word can also be spelled as wigga, whigger or whigga, also known as acting black.

The term originates from a blend of the word white and the insulting term nigger. The word is considered offensive by some because of its sameness to nigger.  Also known to be offensive due to stereotypical ideas about urban blacks.

The act of white people using stereotypical black actions, slang, and clothing has appeared in many generations since slavery was removed in the western world. The concept has been documented in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia and other white-majority countries. An early form of this was the white negro in the jazz and swing music scenes of the 1920s and 1930s; as seen in the 1957 Norman Mailer essay, "The White Negro: Superficial Reflections on the Hipster"." It was later seen in the Zoot suiter of the 1930s and 1940s; the hipster of the 1940s; and the beatnik and rock and roller of the 1950s.

[[Opcode]]

CATEGORIES: Computer science

An opcode identifies which basic computer operation in the instruction set is to be performed. It is used when writing machine code. It tells the computer to do something. Each machine language instruction typically has both an opcode and operands.  The opcode is like a verb in a sentence, and the operands are like the subject in a sentence.

Operands are typically memory or registry addresses.

Opcodes are used in machine code for a number of functions, including Float Addition of registers, Two's compliment addition of registers, Shifting register values to memory, or to a hard drive, stopping a program, etc. There are quite literally hundreds of common opcodes employed in modern computers.

Due to the nature of a computer's architecture, opcodes take the form of binary numbers. Alternatively, opcodes can be represented by hexadecimal digits, (for example, 10100101 = A5) for ease of reading and coding when designing or emulating a machine-code program. These values are then transformed into their binary equivalents to be saved. Modern opcodes are at least two hex characters in length which take up 1 byte of storage space.

Opcodes will vary in capability and 'value' depending on the computer to which they belong, as they are hardware dependent. For instance, the opcode for STORE as expressed in Hex could be FA for one machine and 02 for another. Some opcodes will not be available on some computers. In general, there are two approaches toward building instruction sets. A reduced instruction set computer (RISC) offers less possible opcodes in favor of increasing speed for simple processes. Complex instruction set Computing (CISC) offers more opcodes in favor of increasing speed for complex processes.

Opcodes are seldom used by programmers directly. Whenever they are directly programmed into memory, they are only ever guaranteed to work on the computer they were designed for. When programmers write in assembly language, a translator program converts program statements, one-for-one, into machine language commands.  The programmer must only remember a mnemonic for each opcode instead of its binary value.  Alternatively, a high level-programming language can be used, say 4th generation, which gets converted to 3rd generation and so on until it reaches 1st generation. From here, an individual computer will convert the program to machine code whenever the program file is read. This way, a program can work on a much larger variety of computers.

[[Viral culture]]

CATEGORIES: Medical tests, Virology

A Viral culture is a laboratory test in which the virus samples are placed with a cell medium that the virus being tested for is able to infect. If the cells show changes, known as cytopathic effects, then a culture is positive, meaning the test indicates infection.

The older way of viral culture has been replaced by shell vial culture, in which the sample is spun onto a single layer of cells and viral growth is measured by antigen detection ways. This shortens the time to detection for slow growing viruses such as cytomegalovirus, for which the method was developed.

[[Viral life cycle]]

CATEGORIES: Virology

Viruses are near the same to living organisms, however there are differences.  One of the ways a virus can be seen as living is that a virus needs to make more of themselves. A virus cannot survive on its own. It is only active when reproducing within a host, using a hosts' resources and food. Once inside a host, a virus's main purpose is to make as many copies of itself, and infect other host cells; everything it does is to benefit its fitness and increase the number of its offspring.

[[Empathy]]

[[Philosophical skepticism]]

CATEGORIES: Philosophical movements and positions

Philosophical skepticism (Greek σκέψις - skepsis meaning "enquiry") is a school of philosophical thought of skepticism that began in Ancient Greece and a method that crosses many different cultures. Many skeptics examine the meaning systems of their times, and this can often result in a position of doubt. This skepticism can be either disbelief in philosophical solutions, agnosticism, or even rejecting the reality of the outside world. One kind of scientific skepticism talks about looking into claims that lack evidence that can be seen.

In Islamic philosophy, philosophical skepticism was started by Al-Ghazali, known in the West as "Algazel", as a part of the orthodox Ash'ari school of Islamic theology. It has been said that Rene Descartes' ideas in Discourse on the Method may have been influenced by Al-Ghazli.

[[Placoderm]]

CATEGORIES: Fossils, Placoderms

The Placoderms (Placodermi: Greek = plated skin) were a class of armoured prehistoric fish, which lived from the mid Silurian to the end of the Devonian period. Their head and thorax were covered by armoured plates; the rest of the body was scaled or naked, depending on the species. Placoderms were among the first jawed fish, the Gnathostomata. A 380 million year old fossil of one species is the oldest-known example of live birth.

The placoderms were hugely successful in the Devonian period, which is sometimes called the 'Age of Fish'. In the Upper Devonian, a series of extinction events devastated the marine fauna. As the placoderms were predators, this caused a swift decline in their numbers, and the class was entirely extinct by the end of the Devonian.

The main source of placoderm fossils is the Old Red Sandstone continent. This, in the Devonian, was a united North America and western Europe and the continental shelf areas around it. Fossils from these strata in Scotland were collected since the 18th century, and Louis Agassiz wrote the first survey of fossil fish. A century later, Eric Stensiö showed that placoderms were genuine jawed fish.

Remarkable fossils have more recently been found in the Gogo formation of northern Western Australia. This is a former Upper Devonian reef system, where well-preserved fossils of 25 species have been found. The relationship between the placoderm and other jawed fish is still not clear. Most placoderms were benthic predators, near the bottom of the water column. The largest types, such as Dunkleosteus and Gorgonichthys were 6 metre-long top predators in the middle and upper pelagic zones.

[[Teleost]]

CATEGORIES: Ray-finned fish, Teleosts

Teleosts are the dominant fish of the present day. They arose in the Mesozoic era, and include 20,000 living species. The oldest teleost fossils date back to the late Triassic. They evolved from fish like bowfins in the clade Holostei. During the Mesozoic and Cainozoic they diversified. 96 percent of all known fish species are teleosts.

They are, in order of evolution, vertebrates, jawed fish (Gnathostomata), bony fish (Osteichthyes) and ray-finned fish (Actinopterygii).

Teleosts have a movable jaw and changes in the jaw muscles. These changes make it possible for them to protrude their jaws outwards from the mouth. This adaptation improves their ability to grab fast-moving prey.

[[Fresh water]]

CATEGORIES: Water

Fresh water (also 'freshwater' or 'fresh-water') is water that does not have a lot of salt in it.

When people say 'fresh water', they usually mean water from the lakes, rivers, snow, and ice, which is not salty.  It also can mean water that people can drink. The oceans and seas are made up of salt water, which people cannot drink.   

People cannot drink all fresh water, because it might be contaminated. It might have harmful bacteria in it, or poisonous because of chemicals it contains. Water from a tap has been tested and treated so that it is safe to drink. This applies to most countries, but in some place the water needs to be boiled first to kill the germs and drunk after it has cooled down.

Fresh water that people can drink safely is called 'potable water'.  Desalination can turn salt water into drinkable water.

What causes water scarcity is the mismatch between fresh water demand and availability. What this means is that there is fresh water available, but not always where it is most needed.

In many countries the water used by people is recycled water. People pay for water supply which is safe to drink. Water theft also happens. Thames Water thinks water loss by theft is significant. Waste water (sewage) is treated to purify the water. That is why people are charged for the supply of pure water.

[[Enthalpy]]

CATEGORIES: Thermodynamics

Enthalpy is a concept used in science and engineering when heat and work need to be calculated. The name comes from the Greek word "enthalpos" (ενθαλπος), meaning "to put heat into". The idea and the word were made up by the Dutch scientist Heike Kamerlingh Onnes in 1909.

When a substance changes at constant pressure, enthalpy tells how much heat and work was added or removed from the substance.

Enthalpy is similar to energy, but not the same. When a substance grows or shrinks, energy is used up or released. Enthalpy accounts for this energy. Because of this, scientists often calculate the change in enthalpy, rather than the change in energy.

Consider a system containing a fixed amount of gas. Any heat energy entering the system will:

1) Increase the Internal Energy of the gas

or

2) Lead to some work being done to expand the system.

The work done is the product of pressures and volume. Enthalpy takes both these factors into account, therefore:

[[MRSA]]

CATEGORIES: Gram-positive bacteria

MRSA is a strain of Methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus. This is a bacterium which causes infections in different parts of the body. It is tougher to treat than other strains of Staphylococcus aureus'' – or 'staph' – because it is resistant to some commonly used antibiotics. In fact, it is now resistant to all forms of penicillin and cephalosporin.

The symptoms of MRSA depend on where the infected is. Most often, it causes mild infections on the skin, causing pimples, boils or pus. However, it can also cause more serious skin infections or infect surgical wounds, the bloodstream, the lungs, or the urinary tract.

Though most MRSA infections are not serious, some can be life-threatening. Many public health experts are alarmed by the spread of tough strains of MRSA. Because it is hard to treat, MRSA is sometimes called a "super bug".

[[Colony (biology)]]

CATEGORIES: Zoology

A colony in biology refers to a life-style or habit where members of the same species live together. 

Usually the members of a colony are genetically linked by common heredity. Sometimes, as in bryozoa, they are genetically identical clones, sometimes as in eusociality, they are members of an extended family. Sometimes, as with the Portuguese Man o' War, the members of the colony are joined together as one individual, which operates as a single unit.

Most of the colonies in the groups listed below build a common structure or nest. Sometimes they are linked only by their behaviour. The close integration of termites, ants, bees and wasps is called eusocial.

The term applies mostly to animals, though there are some protists and prokaryotes which live as colonies.

Denis Joseph Savard (born February 4, 1961) is a Canadian retired professional ice hockey centre. Savard played 18 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL). He played for the Chicago Blackhawks, Montreal Canadiens, and the Tampa Bay Lightning.

He was drafted with the 3rd overall pick by the Chicago Blackhawks in the 1980 NHL Entry Draft. He was known for his trademark move, the 'Savardian Spin-o-rama', a move where Savard whirled around with the puck in a full rotation which allowed him to beat defenders and goaltenders. The term was actually coined by Danny Gallivan, referencing the move performed by Serge Savard.

On June 29, 1990, the Chicago Blackhawks traded Savard to the Montreal Canadiens for star defenceman Chris Chelios and a second-round pick (Mike Pomichter). The trade was considered to be largely in the Blackhawks' favor as Chelios would produce some of his best seasons as a Blackhawk while Savard's career was on the decline. Savard won the Stanley Cup with the Canadiens in 1993.

In the Summer of 1993, he signed as a free agent with the Tampa Bay Lightning, where he played 1½ seasons. On April 6, 1995, he was traded back to the Blackhawks, for a 1996 sixth-round pick (Xavier Delisle). He retired from playing professional ice hockey on June 26, 1997. His jersey number #18 was retired by the Chicago Blackhawks on March 19, 1998 and he was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame on November 13, 2000.

After he retired, he became the 36th head coach in Chicago Blackhawks history on November 27, 2006. He was fired in 2008.

All German children between these ages whom Adolf Hitler considered to be "pure-blooded" Germans, were required to join, and parents who stopped their children from joining could be sent to prison for a  long time. In order to get rid of any distractions or other groups that might keep children from being involved with the Hitler Youth, Hitler banned all other youth groups or clubs. The Hitler youth also prepared boys for the army and taught them how to use weapons.

The purpose of the Hitler Youth was to train children to accept values such as duty to the Nazi Party and to Hitler, and to teach them to be prepared even to give their lives for their country.  Many children died because of the Hitler Youth.

The Attack on Pearl Harbor was a surprise attack by Japan against the neutral United States naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii on the morning of December 7, 1941.  It led the United States into World War II. Japan was planning a war in Southeast Asia, against Britain and the Netherlands, as well as the U.S. in the Philippines. All these countries refused to sell petroleum and other war supplies that Japan needed for the Second Sino-Japanese War. Japan attacked so that the U.S. Pacific Fleet, which was a collection of ships that the United States could use in a war, would not enter that war.

The attack was made up of two  aerial attack waves (the third canceled) totaling 353 aircraft, launched from six Japanese aircraft carriers. Their commander was Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto.  2,390 people died in the attack.

All the eight American battleships in the harbor were sunk, along with several other ships. USS Arizona (BB-39) exploded; the other battleships were later refloated. The three American aircraft carriers (Enterprise, Lexington, and Saratoga) were elsewhere. Hundreds of aircraft were destroyed and shore installations were slightly damaged. Japan declared war on the United States the same day.

Elizabeth Cady Stanton (November 12, 1815 – October 26, 1902) was an American social activist, abolitionist, and leading figure of the early women's rights movement along with Susan B. Anthony. Her Declaration of Sentiments, presented at the first women's rights convention held in 1848 in Seneca Falls, New York, is often credited with initiating the first organized women's rights and women's suffrage movements in the United States.

Stanton received a very good education. That was not common for women during that time. She married Henry Stanton, who fought against slavery. They had seven children. She became interested in women's rights when she was at a World's Anti-Slavery meeting in London. She and Lucretia Mott, another activist, were upset because women were not allowed to be a part of the meeting. Because of this, they created their own women's rights meeting.

The first meeting was in 1848 in Seneca Falls, New York. Stanton wrote The Declaration of Sentiments which was about the need for changes. Some of the changes they wanted were allowing women to vote and making women be equal to men in society. The Declaration was signed by the women at the conference. Stanton continued to fight for women's rights by spreading petitions throughout New York. These petitions were meant to push the New York Congress into passing the New York Married Women's Property Act.

In 1851, Stanton met Susan B. Anthony, another famous activist. Stanton and Anthony worked together for a very long time. Together they wrote speeches, articles, and books. Stanton and Anthony were leaders of the women's rights movement for more than fifty years.

Stanton and Matilda Gage wrote the Declaration or Rights. That was presented by Susan B. Anthony at the Philadelphia Centennial in 1876. Stanton traveled around the country and position as president of the National Woman Suffrage Association. During her travels she spoke about current social issues having to do with women's rights. Some of the issues were divorce laws and raising children.

In her later years, Stanton was still politically active, although she didn't travel as much. She wrote, with Anthony and Gage, books called the History of Woman Suffrage from 1881 to 1885. She also published the Woman's Bible. She wrote a book about her life called Eighty Years and More. Stanton died in 1902 in New York City, only eighteen years before women were allowed to vote.

[[Warning colouration]]

CATEGORIES: Coevolution, Ethology

Warning colouration (or aposematism) is how animals let other animals know that they are poisonous or dangerous. It is the exact opposite of camouflage. Warning colours are usually some combination of red, yellow, black and white.

Alfred Russel Wallace, a British naturalist, explained it this way, in 1889:

Wallace predicted that birds and other predators would reject conspicuous prey whilst accepting cryptic prey. Later reports confirmed this.

Animals with warning colours move slowly and expose themselves to sight. The sluggishness and exposure helps to advertise their defence. Along with the colour and behaviour often goes the foul smell of their chemical weapons. The grasshopper Aularches miliaris is a very good example. Noxious caterpillars often have thick, leathery cuticles which help them to resist young birds making a 'test'. When the bird takes a peck, disgusting fluid seeps out from special glands on its back. The caterpillar (or other larva) will often survive such an attack, and the young bird has learnt a lesson it will never forget. All in all, the predator is given good warning. Tests show that warning colours definitely do deter predators.

Some individual animals will die or receive damage while birds or mammals on the attack learn about the connection between colour and taste. However, if warning costs less than hiding, the animal benefits. And the advertising traits such as colours may serve other functions as well. The patterns may help mate identification within the species, for instance.

Warning colouration is the basis of two different kinds of mimicry: Müllerian mimicry and Batesian mimicry.

[[Sawfly]]

CATEGORIES: Hymenoptera

A sawfly is an insect belonging to suborder Symphyta of the order Hymenoptera. The sawflies are a group of largely plant-eating (herbivorous) insects. The group is less specialised than the ants, bees and wasps.

Sawflies differ from most other Hymenoptera by their broad connection between the abdomen and the thorax, and by their caterpillar-like larvae. The common name comes from the saw-like appearance of the ovipositor, which the females use to cut into the plants where they lay their eggs. Large populations of certain sawfly species may cause  economic damage to forests and cultivated plants. 

As of 2013, the Symphyta are treated as nine superfamilies (one extinct) and 25 families. Most sawflies belong to the Tenthredinoidea superfamily, with about 7,000 species worldwide. Tenthredinoidea has six families, of which Tenthredinidae is by far the largest with some 5,500 species.

[[Protectionism]]

CATEGORIES: Economic history

Protectionism means that a country has laws or other rules that make it easier for their own products and brands to sell by making goods from foreign countries more expensive or harder to get.

The idea of protectionism is to stop imports (when people buy goods from other countries instead of from their own). Mercantilism is one kind of protectionism.

For example, if farmers from Argentina are selling wheat at a lower price than French farmers are, French people would buy more wheat from Argentine farmers than from French farmers, and French farmers would not get so much money.

The benefits to protectionism is that some people in a country would make more money because they would be able to sell things at higher prices, but on the other hand, other people would lose money because they wouldn't be able to buy the things from other countries that sell them cheaper.

Many protectionists (people who believe in protectionism) support big tariffs (taxes on a trade involving a foreign country) because the government can get a lot of money from the tariffs.

When a country raises a tariff on another country, usually the other country raises their tariffs on that country to get even.  This is called a trade war.

Tariffs were popular in the United States during the 1800s, but when the United States made the Hawley-Smoot Tariff a law in 1930, it raised tariffs very high on Europe.  In response, Europe raised its tariffs on the United States, which resulted in a trade war.  Many economists and historians believe that the tariffs made the Great Depression worse.

Protectionism is no longer popular now.  Instead, people support free trade (the opposite of protectionism where the government makes it easier for the country to trade with other countries).

The album did not get good reviews by critics in 1969 but the album still sold many copies, today, the album is generally seen as a rock classic. 

On the album, guitarist and producer Jimmy Page used many different techniques to get a unique sound. For example, he recorded the instruments from far away instead of putting the microphone right in front of the amplifier or drum set, this gives a different sound, like it sounds in the room when it was played. https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/11027261/the_long_shadow_of_led_zeppelin/print https://web.archive.org/web/20071212022936/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/11027261/the_long_shadow_of_led_zeppelin/print

This upset many fans at the time who said that the band should focus on making more rock music, but there were still some rock songs on the album, such as "Immigrant Song" and "Celebration Day".

[[Avalon (song)]]

CATEGORIES: 1920s songs, 1920

"Avalon" is a popular song. It was written by Al Jolson, Buddy DeSylva and Vincent Rose in 1920. It was first recorded by Jolson and used in the musicals Sinbad and Bombo. Jolson's version became #2 on the American singles chart. It is possible that Rose wrote the song alone, and that Jolson's name was used in the credits because he was a popular artist and helped make the song popular. At first only Rose and Jolson were marked as the writers, and DeSylva's name was added later.

Many jazz artists have recorded the song, for example Cab Calloway (1934), Coleman Hawkins (1935) and Eddie Durham (1936). Benny Goodman played the song in his concert in Carnegie Hall in 1938. The song was also played in the films The Jolson Story (1946) and The Benny Goodman Story (1956).

The melody at the beginning of the song was taken from Giacomo Puccini's opera Tosca, and Rose changed it only a little. Because of this, a court later decided that Jolson and Rose had to pay Puccini's publishers $25,000 and all later profits from the song.

[[Phoney War]]

CATEGORIES: 1939 in Europe, 1940 in Europe, 1940s in France, World War II

The Phoney War was a name for the months after Poland was defeated in September 1939 and before France was invaded in May 1940, during World War II. 

During this time, there were no big military operations in Europe. There was a British and French declaration of war on Germany, and military alliances between the Western Allies and Poland. The Royal  Air Force dropped propaganda leaflets on Germany, and Canadian troops began to arrive in Britain. At sea, Britain and France blockaded Germany. German submarines destroyed many Allied ships, marking the beginning of Battle of the Atlantic.

In April 1940, Germany invaded Denmark and Norway. The two sides began to fight each other again. Britain and France needed a lot of weapons quickly, so they began to buy them from American weapon companies. The American government helped Britain and France by selling weapons at lower cost, and, later, lend-lease of military equipment and supplies.

[[Radiolaria]]

CATEGORIES: Protista

Radiolaria are amoeboid protists which produce mineral skeletons. The skeletons, usually of silica (SiO2), have a central capsule. This divides the cell into inner and outer portions, called endoplasm and ectoplasm. 

Radiolaria are found as zooplankton throughout the ocean, and their skeletal remains cover large portions of the ocean floor as radiolarian ooze. Radiolaria have existed since the beginning of the Palaeozoic era. They take their name from the radial symmetry of most species. They are valuable markers or diagnostic fossils, because they have a rapid turn-over of species. This helps to identify strata, and to correlate strata at different sites.

Radiolaria are heterotrophs (eat other things), but also may include protist algae as endosymbionts.

[[Heat lamp]]

CATEGORIES: Heat

A heat lamp is a lamp (light) with the main purpose of making heat.  This is commonly infrared light but white light incandescent lightbulbs are also used.  Sometimes the glass of the light bulb is colored to cut out yellow and even higher frequency light (to let the infrared light through, which has most of the heat).

Humans can use these lamps to keep warm, to warm a part of the body that is injured and needs gentle heat, etc. These lamps are also frequently used to keep baby chickens, piglets or other baby animals warm.

Robert "Bobby" Lee Dodd (November 11, 1908 – June 21, 1988) was an American college football coach at Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech). He was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame as a player and coach. He is one of only three people to have done this.

Dodd was born in Galax, Virginia. He moved to Kingsport, Tennessee and played several sports at Dobyns-Bennett High School. After high school, he played as a quarterback at the University of Tennessee. From 1931–1945, he worked as an assistant coach for William Alexander at Georgia Tech. Alexander hired Dodd while he was still a student at Tennessee. Dodd replaced Alexander in 1945 and became the third head coach at Georgia Tech. He retired from coaching after the 1966–67 season, with 165 wins, 64 losses, and 8 ties in his career. He also worked as athletic director for Georgia Tech from 1950 until 1976.

[[Wrongful life]]

CATEGORIES: Abortion

Wrongful life is a legal action in which someone is sued for not stopping the birth of a severely disabled child.  In this type of lawsuit a child and the parents will sue a doctor or a hospital.  The doctor or hospital is sued for not giving information about the disability during the pregnancy.  The doctor or hospital may have not provided all the information on a genetic case before the pregnancy.  The parents argue that if the mother had known this information, she would have had an abortion, or chosen not to become pregnant at all.

In the past, only parents could sue for their own damages the occurred as a result of the birth of a disabled child (e.g., the mother's own pregnancy medical bills and cost of psychiatric treatment for both parents' emotional distress resulting from becoming aware that their child was disabled).  This cause of action is known as wrongful birth.  But the child could not sue for his or her own damages, which were often much more in terms of money and harm.

In four U.S. states, the child is allowed to start a wrongful life cause of action for damages.  In 1982, the Supreme Court of California was the first state supreme court to permit the child's right to sue for wrongful life, but in the same decision, limited the child's recovery to special damages.  

Most other jurisdictions, including England and Ontario, have not allowed the wrongful life cause of action.

[[Intensity (physics)]]

CATEGORIES: Physical quantity

In Physics, intensity can usually be understood as the strength of something like a beam of light. To figure out (i.e., compute) the exact intensity of a beam of light or a fire hose spraying water, we need to know how many units of light or water are coming to some area in some period of time. A factory might have an "intensity" of 100 cars per day delivered to the loading dock. A fire hose might have an intensity of 100 buckets of water per minute per open window of a certain size in a burning building. 

[[Baked Alaska]]

CATEGORIES: Desserts, Baked foods, Ice cream

Baked Alaska is a dessert made of ice cream on top of slices of sponge cake or Christmas pudding and covered with meringue. The whole dessert is then baked in a very hot oven for just long enough to cook the meringue.  The meringue is a good insulator, and the short cooking time prevents the heat from getting through to the ice cream.

Its name, but not the recipe, was made at Delmonico's Restaurant in 1867 to honour the new American territory of Alaska.

February 1 is Baked Alaska Day.

[[Penalty shootout]]

CATEGORIES: Association football

A penalty shootout in association football is a way of deciding who wins match if both teams have scored the same number of goals.

If the score is a draw after 90 minutes, usually the teams will play an extra 30 minutes of extra time. If the score is still equal, then a penalty shootout takes place. Usually each team takes five penalties each, and the team who scores the most wins. If both teams are equal after these penalties, then each team will take one more penalty until one team is ahead.

Penalty shootouts are normally only used in cup matches, and not league matches. If nobody wins in a league match, both teams get one point for the draw. In a cup match often a winner in needed to go to the next round.

Many famous cup finals have been won by penalty shootouts, like the 2006 World Cup final, the 2005 UEFA Champions League final and the 1994 World Cup final.

Its scientific name is Chrysococcyx maculatus.

This bird is not in the Cuculinae subfamily, and so it is not a nest parasite. They raise their own young, like most birds.  Emerald cuckoos lay eggs in a nest built by the parents.

[[Molecular clock]]

CATEGORIES: Evolutionary biology, Paleontology

The molecular clock is the figurative term for a technique which estimates when two taxa diverged in evolution. It is based on comparing the detailed structure of key molecules. The method may be done for species, or any high data used for such calculations is often nucleotide sequences in genome analysis, or amino acid sequences for proteins such as haemoglobin. It is sometimes called a gene clock or evolutionary clock.

[[Key lime pie]]

CATEGORIES: Desserts

Key lime pie is an American dessert made of key lime juice, egg yolks, and sweetened condensed milk in a pie crust. One version uses the egg whites and has a meringue topping. The dish is named after key limes (Citrus aurantifolia 'Swingle'), but it is sometimes made with other types of lime. 

The filling in key lime pie is yellow, mostly because of the egg yolks. When it is being mixed, the condensed milk and the acidic lime juice react and make the filling become thick. Many early recipes for key lime pie did not tell the cook to bake the pie because they used this reaction to make the filling thick. Today, because of food safety, the pies are often baked for a short time. The baking thickens the filling even more.

This delectable dessert derives it's decidedly delicious domicile down in the depths of Key West, Florida.

[[Molecular evolution]]

CATEGORIES: Taxonomy, Evolutionary biology, Molecular biology

Molecular evolution is the process of evolution in DNA, RNA, and proteins. 

Molecular evolution emerged as a scientific field in the 1960s as researchers from molecular biology, evolutionary biology and population genetics sought to understand the structure and function of nucleic acids and protein. Some of the key topics have been the evolution of enzyme function, the use of nucleic acid changes as a molecular clock to study species divergence, and the origin of non-functional or junk DNA. 

Recent advances in genomics, including whole-genome sequencing, and bioinformatics have led to a dramatic increase in studies on the topic. In the 2000s, the role of gene duplication, the extent of adaptive molecular evolution versus neutral genetic drift, and the identification of molecular changes responsible for various human characteristics especially those pertaining to infection, disease, and cognition.

== Molecular study of phylogeny == 

Molecular systematics is the process of using data on the DNA, RNA, or proteins to resolve questions in phylogeny and taxonomy. The idea is to place groups in their correct position on the evolutionary tree. This corrects their biological classification from the point of view of evolution. The technique has already led to major changes in the taxonomy of living things, including the names for higher categories, which had been stable for well over a century.

Molecular systematics has been made possible by techniques for sequence analysis. This gives the exact sequence of nucleotides or bases in either DNA or RNA. At present it is still expensive to sequence the entire genome of an organism, but it has been done for over 100 species.

[[Sequence analysis]]

CATEGORIES: DNA, Molecular biology, Evolutionary biology

Sequence analysis in molecular biology involves identifying the sequence of nucleotides in a nucleic acid, or amino acids in a peptide or protein. Once a sample has been obtained, DNA sequences may be produced automatically by machine and the result displayed on computer. Interpreting those results is still a task for humans.

Information from sequence analysis is used in many fields of biology. It gives information on the relationship between individual organisms, or between groups of organisms. It shows how closely related they are.

[[Riverina]]

CATEGORIES: Regions of New South Wales, Wine regions of Australia

The Riverina (rɪvəˈriːnə) is a large farming area in the south west of New South Wales, Australia. It has flat plains, warm to hot climate and a large supply of water for irrigation. This has allowed the Riverina to become one of the most productive and agriculturally varied areas of Australia. With the state of Victoria to the south, and the mountains of the Great Dividing Range to the east, the Riverina covers those areas of New South Wales in the Murray and Murrumbidgee river systems.

The Riverina has been home to Aboriginal groups for over 40,000 years. It was first settled by Europens in the mid-19th century as a pastoral region growing beef and wool for markets in Australia and overseas. In the 20th century, the building of major irrigation areas in the Murray and Murrumbidgee valleys has led to the introduction of crops such as rice and grapes. The Riverina has strong links to Victoria, and the region was the source of much of the push behind the federation of Australian colonies.

The major cities and towns in the Riverina include Wagga Wagga, Albury and Griffith. Albury and Wagga Wagga are home to campuses of Charles Sturt University. Wagga Wagga is home to two major Australian Defence Force bases.

[[Phylogeny]]

CATEGORIES: Evolutionary biology, Taxonomy

A phylogeny is a proposal of how organisms are related by their evolutionary history.p336 It is based on the evidence that all living things are related by common descent. The evidence for phylogeny  comes from palaeontology, comparative anatomy, and DNA sequence analysis.

The main product of phylogenetics is a phylogenetic tree or tree of life. This is a diagram showing a pattern of ancestor/descendent relationships. Information may be related to geological periods or estimated dates. A biological classification is another type of product.

[[Giant Gippsland earthworm]]

CATEGORIES: Annelids

The giant Gippsland earthworm (Megascolides australis) is one of Australia's 1,000 native earthworm species. These Giant earthworms average at 100 cm long and 2 cm in diameter and can reach 3 m in length. It is difficult to measure length, as the worms will stretch, so scientists use weight to estimate the size. The average weight of a fresh adult worm is about 200 grams. They have a dark purple head and a blue-gray body.

The worms are found in the Bass River Valley of South Gippsland, near Korumburra and Warragul. They are only found in a small area, of about 100,000 hectares. They live in small pockets of blue-grey clay close to water. They live in burrows about 500mm deep, and can burrow as deep as 1.5m.

The habitat the worms used to live in was tall eucalypt forests. Most of this has been cleared for farming, but the worms have continued to survive because they live deep underground. They have been listed a vulnerable species because of these changes. The worms only lay a single egg, between 4-7cm in size. These can take up to one year to hatch, and the worms take several years to become adults, and be able to reproduce. This slow rate of growth, also makes them a vulnerable species.

[[Himalayan monal]]

CATEGORIES: Birds of Asia, Birds of Pakistan, Galliformes

The Himalayan monal (Lophophorus impejanus), also known as the Impeyan monal or pheasant, is a bird in the pheasant family, Phasianidae.

Lady Impey attempted, with great prospect of success, to bring some of them to England, but after living on board for two months they caught a disorder from the other poultry, and died".

It is the national bird of Nepal, where it is known as the danphe (or Danfe), and is mentioned frequently in Nepali songs. It is also the state bird of Uttarakhand, India. In Kashmir, it is the state/regional bird of the disputed territory.

[[Hagfish]]

CATEGORIES: Agnatha

Hagfish are craniates in the superclass Cyclostomata, class Myxini. Hagfish do not have a skeleton, except they do have a skull, which is made of cartilage.

Because of this, many researchers think Myxini should not be in the subphylum Vertebrata.  However, because of its fins and gills, they are called fish. They are marine, meaning they live in the sea.

The original 19th century classification groups hagfish and lampreys together as cyclostomes (or historically, Agnatha), as the oldest surviving class of vertebrates alongside gnathostomes . An alternative scheme proposed that jawed vertebrates are more closely related to lampreys than to hagfish, so vertebrates include lampreys but exclude hagfish.

Recent DNA evidence supports the original scheme.

[[Population (statistics)]]

CATEGORIES: Statistics

In statistics, a population is a set of things from which samples may be drawn. This allows statistical inferences to be drawn, or estimates made of the total population. For example, if we were interested in crows, then we would sample the set of crows which is of interest. The population of crows is limited to crows that exist now or in the future. Probably, geography will be a limitation in practice.  To fairly represent the whole population a sample needs to be random. 

Population is also used to refer to a set of measurements or values, not only cases actually observed. Suppose, for example, we are interested in the set of all adult crows now alive in the county of Cambridgeshire, and we want to know the mean weight of these birds. For each bird in the population of crows there is a weight, and the set of these weights is called the population of weights.

[[Biota]]

CATEGORIES: Biology

A biota is a term used for all the living things at a certain time at a certain place. Examples of biota include Cambrian biota and Madagascan biota.

[[Geothermal energy]]

CATEGORIES: Geothermal energy, Alternative energy

Geothermal energy (from the Greek roots geo, meaning earth, and from thermos, meaning heat) is energy made by heat inside the Earth's crust.

Although the Sun does heat the surface of the Earth, the heat from inside the Earth is not caused by the Sun. The geothermal energy of the Earth's crust comes 20% from the original formation of the planet, and 80% from the radioactive decay of minerals.  The Earth is hottest at its core and, from the core to the surface, the temperature gets gradually cooler.

Resources of geothermal energy range from the shallow ground to hot water and hot rock found a few miles or kilometers beneath the Earth's surface, and down even deeper to the extremely high temperatures of molten rock called magma. It has been used for bathing from Paleolithic times, but is now better known for making electricity.

All over the world, geothermal energy was used to make about 10 gigawatts of electricity in the year 2007, about 0.3% of the electricity used around the world.  When used to generate electricity, geothermal power plants typically offer constant output.

Geothermal energy is also used directly for district heating, or in other heating and cooling applications. Buildings in Iceland are heated in this way from the country's many geothermal sites.

Power plants and thermal applications of geothermal energy are mature technologies, whereas enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) projects are a new type of application.

Almost everywhere, the ground 10 feet (3m) below the Earth's surface maintains a nearly constant temperature between 50° and 60 °F (10° and 16 °C). Geothermal heat pumps can tap into this resource to heat and cool buildings. A geothermal heat pump system consists of a heat pump, an air delivery system (ductwork), and a heat exchanger - a system of pipes buried in the shallow ground near the building. In the winter, the heat pump uses power to remove heat from the heat exchanger and pumps it into the indoor air delivery system. In the summer, the process is reversed, and the heat pump uses power again to move heat from the indoor air into the heat exchanger. The heat removed from the indoor air during the summer can also be used to provide a free source of hot water. The power to run the heat pump comes from another source.

Geothermal energy escapes as hot water at many hot springs or as steam at geysers.

In the United States, most geothermal reservoirs of hot water are in the western states, Alaska, and Hawaii. Wells can be drilled into underground reservoirs for the generation of electricity. Some geothermal power plants use the steam from a reservoir to power a turbine / generator, while others use the hot water to boil a working fluid that vaporizes and then turns a turbine. Hot water near the surface of Earth can be used directly for heat. Direct-use applications include heating buildings, growing plants in greenhouses, drying crops, heating water at fish farms, and several industrial processes such as pasteurizing milk.

Hot dry rock resources occur at depths of 3 to 5 miles (5–8 km) everywhere beneath the Earth's surface and at lesser depths in certain areas. Access to these resources involves injecting cold water down one well, circulating it through hot fractured rocks, and drawing off the heated water from another well. Currently, nobody uses this method commercially. Existing technology also does not yet allow recovery of heat directly from magma, the very deep and most powerful resource of geothermal energy.

The 1910 Cuba hurricane was said to be one of the worst tropical cyclones that has ever hit Cuba. The storm formed in the southern Caribbean Sea on October 9, 1910. It grew stronger as it moved northwest. It then made landfall on the western end of Cuba. The storm made a loop over open water, and then began moving towards the United States. After crossing Florida, the storm moved near the rest of the southeastern United States and passed out to sea.

Because of the storm's loop, some reports said it was actually two hurricanes. In Cuba, the storm was one of the worst disasters in the island's history. There was bad damage and thousands of people lost their homes. In Florida, the storm also caused damage and caused flooding in some areas. It is not known exactly how much damage the storm caused. However, losses in Havana, Cuba were over $1 million. At least 100 people died in Cuba alone.

[[Screaming]]

CATEGORIES: Communication

Screaming is a vocal technique often used in punk rock, fast played metal music, and screamo. It is usually simply either a louder than normal high pitched form of singing, or a louder than normal low pitched form of singing. In both cases the vocalist usually tries to make it sound like some sort of beast's growl. For this reason, a low pitched scream is usually called a death growl.

More experimental forms of screaming are often used in alternative rock and emo music. These genres often have shrill screaming that has an emotional tone to it. The band, Thursday, is a good example of this.

Screaming is popular in genres: screamo, post-hardcore, hardcore punk, heavy metal, and many more.

Some other bands that have screaming include Silverstein, Hawthorne Heights, and Escape the Fate.

[[Service sector]]

CATEGORIES: Economics

The Service Sector, also called tertiary sector, is the third of the three traditional economic sectors. The other two are the primary sector, which covers areas such as farming, mining and fishing; and the secondary sector which covers manufacturing and making things. The service sector provides services, rather than producing material commodities. Activities in the service sector include retail, banks, hotels, real estate, education, health, social work, computer services, recreation, media, communications, electricity, gas and water supply.

The service sector is an important part of the economy. For example, in Australia in 2007, 85% of all businesses were in the service sector. In 2009 there were more than nine million people employed in the service sector in Australia, which was 86% of all jobs. In India, there has been a huge growth in service sector businesses which made up 55% of India's GDP in 2006—2007. Computer software businesses in India are increasing at a rate of 35% per year.

Many sector businesses focus on what is called the “knowledge  economy”. They need to keep ahead of other businesses by understanding what their customers want and being ready to give it to them quickly and at low cost. 

One good example of this are banks which went through big changes in the late 20th century. Using information and communication technology, banks have vastly reduced the number of people they need to employ, and lowered the cost of providing bank service. For example, an automated teller machine is able to provide basic banking services 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, in many different places. Before this, banking services were only available from the bank when it was open. Many banks and building societies have joined together to form much lower cost businesses that can make more money from a wider customer base. The key to this process is gaining information about their customers and constantly coming up with new services for them. 

[[Uzziah]]

CATEGORIES: Old Testament people, Kings of ancient Israel, Kings of ancient Judah

Uzziah (עֻזִּיָּהוּ in Hebrew, meaning Yahweh is my strength; Οζίας; Ozias), also known as Azariah (עֲזַרְיָה in Hebrew; Αζαρις; Azarias), was the king of the ancient Kingdom of Judah, and one of King Amaziah's sons, whom the people chose to rule after his father (2; 2 Chronicles 26:1). He was 16 years old when he became king of Judah and ruled for 52 years. He "did that which was right in the sight of the Lord" (2; 2). According to the Bible, at first he was a good king and had great success. His fields and vineyards grew well, he dug many wells and towers in the desert, he defeated his enemies with a strong army, and he became very powerful. A seal with Uzziah's name has been found in a cistern at Tell Beit Mirsim.

However, he grew proud, and entered the temple of the LORD to burn incense on the altar of incense (2). Azariah the priest with 80 other priests came to him and said, "Leave...for you have been unfaithful...you will not be honored by the LORD God". Uzziah became angry, but while "...he was raging at the priests...leprosy broke out on his forehead", and he "...had leprosy until the day he died". Because of this, his son Jotham ruled the palace and the people of the land. He died and was buried in a field that belonged to the kings. Probably because of his leprosy, Uzziah was buried in a cemetery belonging to the kings, but not in the tombs of the kings.

[[Shale]]

CATEGORIES: Sedimentary rocks

Shale is a fine-grained sedimentary rock formed from mud. The mud is a mix of flakes of clay minerals and tiny fragments (silt-sized particles) of other minerals, especially quartz and calcite. The ratio of clay to other minerals is variable.  Shale is characterized by breaks along thin laminae or parallel layering or bedding less than one centimeter in thickness, called "fissility" (= ~splitting). Mudstones, on the other hand, are similar in composition but do not show the fissility.

Shales and mudrocks contain roughly 95 percent of the organic matter in all sedimentary rocks. However, this amounts to less than one percent by mass in an average shale. Black shales form in anoxic (without oxygen) conditions. They contain free carbon and iron sulfides such as pyrite. This produces the black colouration.

[[Zooid]]

[[Bronchus]]

CATEGORIES: Pulmonology

Bronchi (one Bronchus) are the large air tubes leading from the trachea to the lungs. They carry air to the lungs. 

The trachea (windpipe) divides to form the right and left main bronchi. These divide to form smaller and smaller tubes called bronchioles. Eventually the bronchioles end in the alveoli (small air sacs).  At the alveoli, oxygen from the air we breathe into our lungs is moved into the blood.  The blood then carries oxygen around to the rest of the body, which needs oxygen to survive.  Without the bronchi, air would never get into the lungs, and oxygen would never get into our bodies.

The bronchi's walls are made of cartilage. 

The right bronchus (shown on the left in the image on this page) is shorter, wider, and straighter than the left bronchus.

[[Three-sector hypothesis]]

CATEGORIES: Macroeconomics

The Three-sector hypothesis is a large-scale economic type theory. It says that there are three kinds of economic activities, which are very different from each other:

These kinds of activities are called economic sectors. The theory speaks about the primary, secondary, and tertiary sector. The theory was developed by Alan Fisher, Colin Clark and Jean Fourastié in the 1930s. Clark used a speech given by Sir William Petty, in 1690. For this reason the theory is also known as Petty's Law. The first sector is about directly using natural resources, the second sector is about processing these resources to obtain "higher level" goods.

The theory also says that the main focus of the economy of a country will change, from the primary to the secondary, and from the secondary to the tertiary sector, as economic development progresses.

[[Osteogenesis imperfecta]]

CATEGORIES: Genetic disorders, Diseases and disorders of bones

Osteogenesis imperfecta is a genetic disorder. It is commonly called brittle bone disease. It is usually an autosomal dominant disease, which means a person can get it if only one of their parents has the abnormal gene. OI affects the part of the bones called the collagen rod, which provides bone strength. The abnormal gene weakens or even destroys the collagen rod. This disease was first identified by Vrolik in 1849.

When someone has this disease, their bones are more likely to break. Unfortunately, osteogenesis imperfecta has no cure. This disease is categorized in four types: Type one is the most common case and it often causes brittle teeth and bone related injuries. Type two is a more severe version of type one and has most of the same symptoms just in more severe cases. People with type three of osteogenesis imperfecta may have more than 100 fractures before puberty. Their eyes often develop a purple, blue, or grey tint and people with this case also often have hearing loss. 50% of people that have osteogenesis imperfecta have hearing loss while becoming an adult. Type 4 is a more severe case of most symptoms stated above.

[[Paranasal sinuses]]

CATEGORIES: Head (body part)

Paranasal sinuses are parts of the nasal cavity. They are usually counted to be part of the respiratory system. They are mucous membranes, which are mostly inside bones. These bones are then filled with air, which makes the skull look bigger, without adding much extra weight. Prenasal cavities can be found in mammals, most birds, dinosaurs, and crocodilians.

Since sinuses are in virtually all land vertebrates, they must have a function. They are covered with a mucosa, epidermal cells which are moist and make mucus. This moistens and warms the air on its way into the lungs. The mucus also picks up particles which come in with the air. A variety of possible functions have been proposed:

[[Fishing lure]]

CATEGORIES: Fishing

A fishing lure is an object used to catch fish. It is tied to the end of a fishing line. A fishing lure is made to look like something a fish would eat. They move in a special way and have certain colors. Lures have fishing hooks attached to them. 

They are usually used with a fishing rod.  When a lure is used, it is cast, or thrown, out into the water and pulled back in. A good fisherman can cast the lure into places where the fish hide, like under logs.

There are many types of fishing lures. Most of them are made to look like dying, injured, or fast fish. They can be made of wood, plastic, rubber, metal, cork, feathers, animal hair, and other things. Some are shiny so that they catch the fish's attention.

Fishing lures can come in many different types such as a jig or a popper. A jig will usually have a weight attached to it so it can float at the right height. A popper is a lure used to attract trout and bass. A popper has a colorful design in the front to attract fish. Fishing lures can be very expensive as some are sold for thousands of dollars. 

The fishing lure was invented in 1890 by a man named James Heddon. He created the fishing lure by accident by taking a big piece of wood and carving a frog shape into it and taking the lure and attaching it to his line. Then he threw it in the water and immediately caught a bass. The next day he started a company called the Heddon Company and the era of the fishing lure was born.

[[Bilby]]

CATEGORIES: Marsupials of Australia

The bilby (also known as the rabbit-eared bandicoot) is a rabbit-like marsupial. It lives in deserts, dry forests, dry grasslands, and dry shrubby areas in Australia. The bilby's pouch faces backwards. These big-eared, burrowing mammals were in danger of extinction, but now they are back living in New South Wales.

The bilby, like all bandicoots, is a nocturnal animal (most active at night). Digging with its strong, clawed feet, this solitary mammal excavates long, complex burrows. Its underground dens are up to 5 feet (1.5 m) long.

Bilbies have the usual long bandicoot muzzle and big ears. They are about 29–55 long. Compared to bandicoots, they have a longer tail, bigger ears, and softer, silky fur. The size of their ears allows them to have better hearing, and to radiate heat. They are nocturnal omnivores that do not need to drink water.  They get their moisture from food, which includes insects and their larvae, seeds, spiders, bulbs, fruit, fungi, and very small animals. Most food is found by digging or scratching in the soil, and by using their very long tongues.

[[Butter cake]]

CATEGORIES: Cakes, Butter

Butter cake is a cake with butter as a main ingredient. 

The traditional English pound cake used equal parts of butter, flour, sugar, and eggs to produce a heavy, rich cake. This was the first butter cake.  The invention of baking powder during the 19th century made it possible to have lighter, fluffier cakes using these same ingredients, making the modern butter cake. 

Butter cakes are often made by beating the butter and sugar until fluffy. This is called creaming.  Eggs are added, then the other ingredients.

Butter cakes taste best when stored at room temperature, because they dry out and lose taste when refrigerated.

[[Baking powder]]

CATEGORIES: Chemicals, Baking, Food ingredients

Baking powder is a dry chemical leavening agent used to make baked foods lighter and less dense. Baking powder works by making a reaction between an acid and a base. This produces carbon dioxide bubbles to make the mixture light. Baking powder was invented by the English chemist Alfred Bird  (1811 – 15 December 1878) in 1843.

It is used when the food should not taste of yeast, or when the mixture is not elastic enough to hold bubbles for very long. But sometimes, it has a metallic taste. Because carbon dioxide is made faster by baking powder than yeast, breads made with it are called quick breads.

Most baking powders are made up of an alkaline (usually baking soda), one or two acid salts, and a starch (cornstarch or sometimes potato starch). Baking soda is where the carbon dioxide comes from, and the acid releases it, like this:August 2021

Bird was quickly followed by Henry Jones (1812 – 12 July 1891) who invented self-rising flour in 1845.

[[Battle royal (professional wrestling)]]

[[Numbat]]

CATEGORIES: Marsupials of Australia

The numbat (Myrmecobius fasciatus) is a marsupial from open woodlands in western Australia. It is also called the banded anteater, because it eats termites.

It is unusual in being one of the few diurnal (daytime) marsupials. It has no pouch, but the mother carries round her four young on her stomach. At night, they take shelter in hollow logs. The numbat has a life span of 5-6 years under human care.

These solitary, long-tailed termite-eaters are in danger of extinction; very few remain in the wild. When Europeans arrived, the numbat was found across the New South Wales and Victorian borders west to the Indian Ocean, and as far north as the southwest corner of the Northern Territory. It was at home in a wide range of woodland and semiarid habitats. 

The deliberate release of the European red fox in the 19th century wiped out the entire numbat population in Victoria, NSW, South Australia and the Northern Territory, and almost all numbats in Western Australia, as well. By the late 1970s, the population was well under 1,000 individuals, concentrated in two small areas not far from Perth, Dryandra, and Perup.

The numbat is the emblem of Western Australia.

A 6.9 earthquake occurred on March 11, 2010, 40 kilometers southwest of Pichilemu, O'Higgins Region, Chile . A tsunami warning was made by the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center Pacific-wide, although they warned of the possibility of local tsunamis within 100 kilometers of the epicenter (between San Antonio and Concepción).

Although news media first reported the earthquake as an aftershock of the February earthquake, the initial geological summary given by the United States Geological Survey  said it was a different earthquake. Though unchained by the regional stress caused by the February 27 earthquake, the March event was not a fast adjustment to February's thrust fault rupture between the Nazca and South American plates, but it was caused by normal faulting inside one of those plates. However, it has not been positively decided in which plate the earthquake occurred.

Within 6 hours, 10 aftershocks took place, of these 2 were of magnitude 6 or greater and 7 between magnitude 5 and 6.

The earthquake took place shortly before the new president, Sebastián Piñera, was sworn in, at about 12:15 PM local time (15:15 UTC), at the Chilean congress in Valparaíso, where the shaking was clearly felt. The presidents of Bolivia, Paraguay, and Ecuador were present when the earthquake occurred, however, the television footage showed that the inauguration was not interrupted.

Damages reported by the Chilean news media include a collapsed pedestrian crossing over Chile Highway 5, north of Rancagua. The most affected place by the earthquake was Pichilemu, the epicentre of the earthquake. It destroyed the Ross Park, the most of the Agustín Ross Cultural Centre and many houses in Espinillo and Rodeillo.

[[Renaissance man]]

CATEGORIES: Renaissance, Society

The term Renaissance man or polymath is used for a very clever man who is good at many different things. It is named after the Renaissance period of history (from the 14th century to the 16th or 17th century in Europe). Two of the best-known people from this time were Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo. Leonardo was a famous painter but he was also a scientist, philosopher, engineer, and mathematician.  Michelangelo was an extraordinary sculptor, painter, architect and poet. They are known as two of the highest examples of what a Renaissance man is.

But the term "Renaissance man" is also often used for extraordinary people not from the Renaissance period. It can be used for anyone who is very clever at many different things, no matter when that person lived. Albert Schweitzer was a 20th century "Renaissance man" who was a theologian, musician, philosopher and doctor. Benjamin Franklin was a "Renaissance man" who lived in the 18th century and was an author and printer, politician, scientist, inventor and soldier.

Hurricane Vince was an unusual hurricane that began in the northeast Atlantic Ocean. It was part of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season. The waters where it formed were thought to be too cold for tropical cyclones to exist. Vince was the 20th named storm and 12th hurricane of the season.

The storm that became Vince started out as an extratropical cyclone. It became a subtropical storm on October 8 to the southeast of the Azores. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) did not officially give the storm a name until the next day. Vince grew into a hurricane before beginning to weaken at sea. On October 11, it made landfall on the Iberian Peninsula in Spain. At that time, it was a tropical depression. It may have been the first storm to hit the area since a hurricane in 1842. Vince died out over Spain. However, it did drop rain on the country. What was left of the storm passed into the Mediterranean Sea.

[[Mannerism]]

CATEGORIES: Art

Mannerism is a style of art that was created in the Late Renaissance period, from about 1520 until about 1600. The Mannerist style of painting or sculpture often shows figures that are "elongated" (made longer) and "distorted" (made into strange shapes"). The aim of the Mannerist artist was usually to make art that looked "elegant".

The Mannerist style began in Italy, where the artists were influenced by the figures that Michelangelo painted on the ceiling and in the "Last Judgement" in the Sistine Chapel. During the Renaissance, artists like Leonardo da Vinci and Raphael had tried very hard to learn from nature, and to paint things in a way that was very realistic. These two famous painters both died around 1520. Many artists then decided that they were going to use the art of painting to "express themselves". They were not going to follow the rules of anatomy and perspective in the way that Leonardo and Raphael did. Mannerist paintings are often full of figures that seem to be twisting, writhing or fighting. The faces of the figures often show strong emotions such as sadness, fear, hatred or sexual feelings.

Not all the painters who were working during the Mannerist period painted in the Mannerist style. Many artists continued to work in the style of the High Renaissance. Painters in the Mannerist style were Tintoretto, Jacopo Pontormo, Agnolo Bronzino, Parmigianino and Rosso Fiorentino. Giambologna and Benvenuti Cellini were Mannerist sculptors. Giulio Romano was a Mannerist architect.

Mannerism spread from Italy to France, Germany and Spain. One of the most famous Mannerist painters was El Greco who worked in Spain. Some other artists who worked in the Mannerist style are the French sculptor Jean Goujon, the Dutch painter Abraham Bloemaert and the German painter Bartolomeus Spranger. Possibly the strangest paintings from this time were by Giuseppe Arcimboldo who did pictures in which people's faces seem to be made from fruit, flowers, fire and even fish.

John Brown (May 9, 1800 – December 2, 1859) was an American abolitionist. Brown supported using violence to end slavery in the United States. He first got national attention when he led small groups of people during the Bleeding Kansas crisis of 1856.

In October 1859, Brown led a raid on the federal armory at Harpers Ferry, Virginia (today West Virginia). He wanted to start a slave liberation movement that would spread south through the areas of Virginia and North Carolina. He took control of the armory, but seven people were killed, and ten or more were injured. Brown wanted to arm slaves with weapons from the armory. However, few local slaves joined his attack. Within 36 hours, Brown's men were killed or captured by local farmers, militiamen, and U.S. Marines. Brown was executed by hanging for treason against the state of Virginia on December 2, 1859. He was the first person executed for treason in the history of the United States.179

Brown is still a controversial person today. He is both remembered as a heroic martyr, and he is hated as a madman and a terrorist.

Sarah Grimké (1792-1873) and Angelina Grimké Weld (1805–1879), known as the Grimké sisters, were 19th-century American Quakers, educators and writers who supported abolitionism and women's rights.

The Grimké sisters were born in Charleston, South Carolina, USA. Sarah Moore Grimke was born on November 26, 1792 and Angelina Emily Grimke was born on November 26, 1805. They traveled in the North, talking about their experiences with slavery on their father's plantation. They were often mocked and laughed at. They both saw that women needed more freedom to help change society. They began helping the women's rights movement.

In 1838, the sisters became the first women to speak at a meeting of the Massachusetts state legislature. They spoke about slavery and abolitionism. People were very shocked. They helped attract thousands of women in New England to the movement. Many came to hear Sarah and Angelina speak at public lectures.

In 1838, Sarah wrote a paper called "Letters on the Equality of the Sexes and the Condition of Women." It answered many questions which were asked in a letter by a group of ministers who did not like the sisters because they had stepped out of their "woman's proper sphere".

When Sarah was 80, she tried to vote.

They lived to see the end to slavery, and the beginning of women's rights.

[[Poverty line]]

CATEGORIES: Poverty

The poverty line, which is also sometimes called the poverty threshold, is the smallest amount of money a person or a family needs to live on; to buy what is needed and is a line which is a gulf between the rich and the poor. It is the imaginary line drawn by the experts which has a particular amount if anybody earn income which is lower than this amount is known as poor and other who earn more than this amount is known as non-poor. People who are below this line are classified as poor. This line is used to decide who can get extra help with things like food, shelter or medical care. There is a poverty line based on the income and another based on consumption levels.

The poverty line is not the same in all countries. It can be decided by the economy. In the United States, the poverty line is different depending on how many people there are in a family. This is because it costs more to buy food and supplies for more people. So, for example, it is higher in a family with eight people than in a family with three people. The poverty line also makes sure the poor and rich are separated immensely. If there were not a poverty line, the distribution of goods to those of whom are actually poor, would decrease.

[[Post-impressionism]]

CATEGORIES: Art movements

Post-impressionism (or Post-Impressionism) is a term used to describe the development of French art after Manet (1832–1883). The British artist and art critic Roger Fry used the term in 1910, and it is now a standard art term. Fry organized the 1910 exhibition Manet and the Post-Impressionists.

The post-impressionists were artists of the late 19th century who saw the work of the French Impressionist painters and were influenced by them. Their art styles grew out of the style called Impressionism. The word "Post-" means "after", so "post-impressionist" painting came after "impressionist" painting. These artists developed impressionism but rejected its limitations. They continued using the real-life subject matter, with vivid colours, often with thick paint. However, they added other ideas. Using geometric forms, to distorting form for effect, and using unnatural colours are some of their ways. The critic Rewald said "the term 'post-impressionism' is not a very precise one, though a very convenient one".

The main post-impressionist painters were Paul Cezanne, Paul Gauguin, Vincent van Gogh, Georges Seurat, Henri Toulouse-Lautrec and Henri Rousseau ('Le Douanier'). Picasso and Braque were certainly post-impressionists, but we describe them as Cubists.

The post-impressionist painters lived in France and knew each other, but they did not work together as a group, in the way that some of the impressionists did. They painted in ways that were different from each other. The post-impressionists led the way for other artists to experiment and develop all the different styles of Modern art in the 20th century.

Emanuel Lasker (24 December 1868 – 11 January 1941) was a German chess player, mathematician, and philosopher who was World Chess Champion for 27 years. 

In his prime Lasker was one of the most dominant champions, and he is generally regarded as one of the strongest players ever. He finally lost the title to Capablanca in 1921.

Lasker demanded high fees for playing matches and tournaments, which aroused some criticism. He had seen how Steinitz's life had ended in poverty, and was determined to avoid this fate. 

The conditions which Lasker demanded for World Championship matches in the last ten years of his reign were controversial, and prompted attempts to define rules for championship matches.

Lasker was also a talented mathematician, and his Ph.D. thesis is regarded as one of the foundations of modern algebra. He was a first-class contract bridge player and wrote about this and other games, including Go and his own invention, Lasca.

[[Baking]]

CATEGORIES: Food_preparation_techniques

Baking is a skill or way of cooking food in an oven. Sometimes, though, baking can also be done in hot ashes, or hot stones. It is used for making bread, cakes, pastries, pies, tarts, cookies, and much more. Such foods made by baking are called "baked goods". 

The ingredients used in baking include flour, water, leavening agents (baker's yeast, baking soda, baking powder), shortening (fats, oils), eggs, milk, and sugars. These are all mixed together to create dough or batter, which is then put into a pan or a sheet and heated. Leavening agents produce gas that becomes trapped in the dough. This makes it rise. Shortening makes doughs more easily workable and the bread that comes out in the end more soft and tender. Egg whites are used to help make a light, airy texture.

Baked goods are sold at a bakery. A person who makes baked goods as a job is called a baker. It is also used for making baked potatoes, baked apples, baked beans, some casseroles and pasta dishes such as lasagna, and various other foods, such as the pretzel.

[[Battle of Salamis]]

CATEGORIES: Battles of the Ancient World, Ancient Greece, Achaemenid Empire, September events, 480 BC

The Battle of Salamis was a naval battle between an Alliance of Greek city-states and the Achaemenid Empire of Persia. It happened in September 480 BC in the straits between the mainland and Salamis Island. It was part of the Greco-Persian Wars.

Although heavily outnumbered, the Greek Allies were persuaded by the Athenian general Themistocles to bring the Persian fleet to battle again. The Persian king Xerxes was also anxious for a decisive battle.

The Persian navy sailed into the Straits of Salamis and tried to block both entrances. In the cramped conditions of the Straits the great Persian numbers were an active hindrance, as ships struggled to maneuver and became disorganised. Seizing the opportunity, the Greek fleet formed in line and scored a decisive victory, sinking or capturing at least 200 Persian ships.

As a result, Xerxes retreated to Asia with much of his army, leaving Mardonius to complete the conquest of Greece. However, the following year, the rest of the Persian army was decisively beaten at the Battle of Plataea and the Persian navy at the Battle of Mycale. Afterwards the Persians made no more attempts to conquer the Greek mainland. These battles of Salamis and Plataea mark a turning point in the Greco-Persian wars; from then on, the Greek cities would take the offensive.

[[Sparrowhawk]]

CATEGORIES: Falconiformes, Birds of Europe, Birds of Asia

The sparrowhawk  (Accipiter nisus) is a small bird of prey in the family Accipitridae. It has a wide distribution in Eurasia and north Africa.

The adult male sparrowhawk has a blue-grey back and wings. His chest and belly have thin orange stripes. Female and young sparrowhawks have brown backs and wings, with thin brown stripes. The female is up to 25% larger than the male. This is one of the biggest size differences in any bird species.

The sparrowhawk eats mostly small birds which live in woodland. It can be seen in any habitat and often hunts birds in town and city gardens. Male sparrowhawks eat smaller birds like tits, finches and sparrows. Females eat bigger birds like thrushes and starlings. They can kill birds weighing more than 500.

The sparrowhawk is seen in Europe, parts of Asia and parts of Africa. Birds that breed in the north migrate south for winter. Birds that live further south stay there, or fly shorter distances.

Sparrowhawks build a nest in woodland. The nest is up to 60 cm (2.0 ft) wide and made from twigs. The female lays four or five eggs with pale blue shells. The chicks hatch after 33 days and leave the nest after another 24 to 28 days.

The proportion of young sparrowhawks which survive to one year old is 34%. More young males die than young females. 69% of adults survive from one year to the next. The average lifespan is four years.

The number of sparrowhawks decreased in Europe in the 1950s. Chemicals to kill unwanted insects ("pesticides") were put on seeds before they were planted. Small birds ate the seeds and then sparrowhawks ate the small birds. The amount of chemicals in the food chain increased. This affected the sparrowhawks. Some were poisoned and others laid eggs with shells that were too thin. The shells broke before the chicks hatched. The pesticides were banned and the sparrowhawk population increased again. It is now one of the commonest birds of prey in Europe.

The sparrowhawk's hunting behaviour means people who own homing pigeons or keep birds for food may dislike it. Some people also blame the sparrowhawk for decreases in the numbers of smaller birds. Scientists have found that increased numbers of sparrowhawks did not reduce the numbers of birds living in farmland and woodland in the 1960s. Research in Scotland found that less than 1% of homing pigeons that died were killed by sparrowhawks.

People have used the Sparrowhawk for falconry (hunting using a bird of prey) for more than 500 years. It is difficult to train but brave. The sparrowhawk features in some old German myths. It is mentioned in a play by William Shakespeare and a poem by Ted Hughes.

[[X86]]

CATEGORIES: Computer processors

x86 is a term used to describe a CPU instruction set compatible with the Intel 8086 and its successors, including the Pentium and others made by Intel and other companies. This is the CPU architecture used in most desktop and laptop computers.  Many 21st century workstations and servers also use x86 processors. In 1985, the original 16 bit x86 architecture was extended to 32 bits with the introduction of the i386 processor. It was extended again to 64 bits in 2003 with the introduction of the AMD Opteron processor. 

Intel adopted the 64-bit computing bit architecture in 2004 with the later versions of the Prescott Pentium 4.  The different versions are backward-compatible, meaning that a 32-bit x86 CPU can run a 32-bit or 16-bit operating system, and a 64-bit x86 CPU can run a 16, 32, or 64-bit operating system.  All x86 CPUs (with the rare exception of some Intel CPUs used in embedded systems) start in 16-bit real mode. A modern operating system (or sometimes the bootloader) switches the CPU into 32-bit protected mode or 64-bit long mode before booting the kernel.

[[Zichyújfalu]]

CATEGORIES: Villages in Hungary

Zichyújfalu is a village in Fejér County, about 10 km from Lake Velencei, which is more or less easy to reach on road and on railway (Pusztaszabolcs-Székesfehérvár line). The settlement used to be a part of Gárdony but declared its independence in December 1997.

The settlement is first mentioned in writing in 1239, when villa Nowa (Nova) belonged to the Vértes estates of the Csák clan. In 1447 it is mentioned as a noble name as Wyfalw (Újfalu).

The Family Zichy appeared as the landlord in Újfalu during Turkish occupation. After the Turkish rule the serfs of Seregélyes rented the land for some time. In 1784 the owner of the estate, János Zichy, the son of Ferenc Zichy had a castle built in Újfalu and established a deer-park.

The paphrase Zichy in the name of the settlement refers to these earlier landlords, the members of the Zichy family. The hunting residence of de count is also in the village; currently the Mayor's Office functions in this building, therefore the building can only be observed from outside. The park and the forest of the castle offer active relaxation.

[[Poison gas]]

CATEGORIES: Weapons, Chemical warfare

Poison gas is any gas that is also a poison. Poison gases can kill or injure a person if present in a high enough concentration. There is a diverse range of different poison gases and each has unique properties. Many toxic liquids are also volatile and their vapors are poison gas. "Poison gas" can refer to poisons in chemical weapons, but most of them are in fact liquids, for example mustard gas and VX are viscous liquids that are dispersed into fine mists.

In small amounts, corrosive poison gases usually cause irritation, and may have a smell, but this is not universal. There are several gases that can kill insidiously, without a warning smell or irritation.

All gases other than oxygen can displace air, and cause death by asphyxiation. This does not make them poison gases. Nitrogen and carbon dioxide are two common examples. This has to be taken into account in handling of any compressed or liquified gas. Gases can be also dangerous because they are flammable (easily bursting into flame).

Poison gases can cause injury more easily than solid or liquid poisons because they diffuse (move) in the air, exposing skin, and are easily breathed in. Immediate contact with corrosive gas leads to chemical burns of the skin and lungs. When absorbed into the inside of the human body and into the blood, either by breathing in or through skin, several poison gases cause a poisoning. In a poisoning, medical help is often necessary; simply removing the victim from the gas is not enough to prevent symptoms.

Poison gases are used in industry as chemical reagents. The chemical reactions they can be used for are more important than their toxicity. Today, chemists try to avoid the use of poisonous gases, but it is often not possible. Examples of large-volume industrial poisonous gases are hydrogen sulfide, cracked from oil, chlorine, in diverse chemical uses and to disinfect drinking water, and ammonia, which is a valuable fertilizer into itself and can be converted into a range of other fertilizers, in addition to chemical uses.

Some fumigants (chemicals used to kill pests) are also poison gases, for example phosphine, which is used to kill pests living in grains. The advantage of a gas is that it evaporates after use, so that if food is treated with gas, there is no need to rinse it to remove the poison. Some gasses can kill you and some can’t. Gasses have advantages and disadvantages.

[[AND gate]]

CATEGORIES: Logic gates

The AND gate is a logic gate that outputs 1 (true) only when both of its inputs are 1 (true). Since 0 is false, AND outputs the product (result of multiplication) of its inputs. That means that if either or both of its inputs are 0, the output will be 0 (zero multiplied by any real number is zero).

Jean Frédéric Bazille (6 December 1841 – 28 November 1870) was a French painter. He was born in Montpellier. He was killed in action in the Franco-Prussian War. It was at the Battle of Beaune-la-Rolande in France while leading his unit into a assault on the German position. He died at the age of 28.

[[F major]]

CATEGORIES: Musical keys, Major scales

F major (or the key of F) is a musical major scale starting on F. Its key signature has one flat.

Its relative minor is D minor and its parallel minor is F minor.

F major is the home key of the English horn, the basset horn, the horn in F, the trumpet in F and the bass Wagner tuba. This means that if you want these instruments to sound in F major, you have to write in C major. Most of these sound a perfect fifth lower than written, except the trumpet in F which sounds a perfect fourth higher. (The basset horn also often sounds an octave and a fifth lower.)

Of the six Overtures Francesco Maria Veracini wrote for Prince Friedrich Augustus in Dresden, most are in either F major or B-flat major because the prince's orchestra had a lot of wind instruments that played best in these keys.

[[E minor]]

CATEGORIES: Musical keys, Minor scales

E minor (Em, Mim) is a  minor scale based on the note E.  Its key signature has one sharp, F # Its relative major is G major.

A lot of classical guitar music is in E minor, because this key is very suited for the instrument. When it is tuned normally, four of the instrument's six strings are part of the tonic chord. The key is also very popular in heavy metal music, because the lowest note on a guitar, E, can be used a lot.

E minor was one of the most-often used keys by Felix Mendelssohn. 

[[B-flat major]]

CATEGORIES: Musical keys, Major scales

Bflat major or B-flat major is a major scale starting on B-flat. Its key signature has two flats.

Its relative minor is G minor, and its parallel minor is Bflat minor.

B-flat major is a good key for most wind instruments, especially those for which it is their home key, such as clarinets, trumpets, saxophones, and the flutes in B-flat. Because of this, many works for concert bands (those you might have played in while you were at school) are written in this or a closely related key such as F major or E-flat major.

Haydn's Symphony No. 98, which had both trumpet and timpani, is known as the first symphony that anyone had written in that key. Actually, his brother Michael Haydn had written one earlier. However, Joseph Haydn still gets credit for writing the timpani part at actual pitch with an F major key signature (instead of transposing with a C major key signature), something that made things easier and made more sense.

Five of Mozart's piano concerti are in B-flat major.

[[G minor]]

CATEGORIES: Musical keys, Minor scales

G minor is a minor scale based on G.

Its relative major is B-flat major.

G minor is one of two flat key signatures that needs a sharp for the seventh note (the other is D minor).

During the Baroque period, music in G minor was usually written with a one-flat key signature.

[[D major]]

CATEGORIES: Musical keys, Major scales

D major is a  major scale based on D. Its key signature has two sharps.  Its relative minor is B minor.

D major is good for violin music because of the structure of the instrument, which has its four strings tuned to G D A E.  The open strings resonate with the D string, producing a special rich sound.

Because of this, many classical composers chose to write violin concertos in D major. Examples include Mozart's (No. 2, 1775, No. 4, 1775); Ludwig van Beethoven's (1806); Paganini's (No. 1, 1817); Brahms's (1878); Tchaikovsky's (1878); Prokofiev's (No. 1, 1917); Stravinsky's (1931); and Korngold's (1945).

It is also suitable for guitar music, with drop tuning for the lowest string making two Ds as open strings.

For some beginning wind instrument students, however, D major is not a very good key, because it transposes to E major for B flat instruments. E major has four sharps, which is harder for new learners to play.

Still, the clarinet in B-flat is often used for music in D major. It is probably the key with the most sharps that it can play well. However, when some composers write a piece in D minor with B-flat clarinets, they change to clarinets in A if the music changes to D major.

Most tin whistles are in D, because they are often used in music with fiddles.

In the Baroque period, D major was seen as "the key of glory"; so many trumpet pieces were in D major. Examples include concertos by Fasch, Gross, Molter (No. 2), Leopold Mozart, Telemann (No. 2), and Giuseppe Torelli; sonatas by Corelli, Franceschini, Purcell, Torelli; and "The Trumpet Shall Sound" and the "Hallelujah" chorus from Handel's Messiah.

After the valve trumpet was invented, composers began to write for trumpet in keys with more flats, so Haydn wrote his famous trumpet concerto in the key of E-flat major.

23 of Haydn's 104 symphonies are in D major, making it the most often used main key of his symphonies. A great number of Mozart's unnumbered symphonies are in D major, namely K. 66c, 81/73, 97/73m, 95/73n, 120/111a and 161/163/141a. The symphony came from the overture, and "D major was by far the most common key for overtures in the second half of the eighteenth century."

Scriabin saw D major as golden in color and when he talked to Rimsky-Korsakov, he gave an example from one of Rimsky-Korsakov's own operas where a character sang in D major about gold.

[[B minor]]

CATEGORIES: Musical keys, Minor scales

B minor is a minor scale based on B.  The harmonic minor raises the A to Asharp.  Its key signature has two sharps.

Its relative major is D major, and its parallel major is B major.

In Baroque times, people thought that B minor was the key of passive suffering. Christian Friedrich Daniel Schubart (1739-1791) said that it was a key that was complaining gently and quietly, something that matches Bach's use of the key in the St. John's Passion. By Beethoven's time, B minor had changed in people's minds: Francesco Galeazzi wrote that B minor was not suitable for music in good taste, and Beethoven labelled a B minor melodic idea in one of his sketchbooks as a "black key".

The chord was famously used as the first chord in Pink Floyd's 1979 hit "Comfortably Numb". The second movement of Rodrigo's Concierto de Aranjuez, one of the most famous compositions for the classical guitar, is in B minor.

It is a common key used in rock, folk, country and other guitarist-based styles because a guitar is naturally tuned so that all the open strings are notes in B minor.

[[C minor]]

CATEGORIES: Musical keys, Minor scales

C minor is a minor scale based on C. The harmonic minor raises the Bflat to Bnatural. Its key signature has three flats. When written in jazz notation, its short form is Cm.

Its relative major is E-flat major, and its parallel major is C major.

[[A major]]

CATEGORIES: Musical keys, Major scales

A major (or the key of A) is a major scale with a base note of A. Its key signature has three sharps.

There are not as many symphonies in A major as in D major or G major, but more than other sharp keys. Beethoven's Symphony No. 7, Bruckner's Symphony No. 6 and Mendelssohn's Symphony No. 4 are almost all the symphonies in this key in the Romantic era. Mozart's Clarinet Concerto and Clarinet Quintet are both in A major. Mozart used clarinets in A major often.

In chamber music, A major is used a lot. Johannes Brahms, César Franck, and Gabriel Fauré wrote violin sonatas in A major. Peter Cropper said that A major "is the fullest sounding key for the violin.", when he was talking about Beethoven's Kreutzer Sonata.

According to Christian Friedrich Daniel Schubart, A major is a key that is good for "declarations of innocent love, ... hope of seeing one's beloved again when parting; youthful cheerfulness and trust in God."

When music for orchestra is in A major, the timpani are normally set to A and E a fifth apart. In most other keys, they are set a fourth apart.

[[F-sharp minor]]

CATEGORIES: Musical keys, Minor scales

F-sharp minor is a minor scale based on F sharp. Its key signature has three sharps. 

Its relative major is A major.

Many people think it is a melancholy and gloomy key.

Harry Farjeon says that F sharp minor is "light red", and that it is the key Mendelssohn uses when he is being passionate.

Johann Mattheson wrote that 'Fsharp minor, although it leads to great distress, nevertheless is more languid and love-sick than lethal. Moreover, it has something abandoned, singular, and misanthropic about it.'

[[A-flat major]]

CATEGORIES: Musical keys, Major scales

Aflat major or A-flat major is a major scale that starts on A-flat.

Its relative minor is F minor and its parallel minor is A-flat minor.

This is a very peaceful key. It was used often by Franz Schubert. Twenty-four of Frédéric Chopin's piano pieces are in A-flat major, more than any other key.

Charles-Marie Widor considered A-flat major to be the second best key for flute music.

Beethoven chose A-flat major as the key of the slow movement for most of his C minor works. This was also followed by Antonín Dvořák in his only C minor symphony and Anton Bruckner in his first two C minor symphonies. 

Since A-flat major was not often chosen as the main key for orchestral music of the 18th century, passages or movements in the key often kept the timpani tuned the same way as they were in the movement before it. For example, Beethoven's Symphony No. 5 in C minor has the timpani set to C and G for the first movement. With hand-tuned timpani, there is no time to retune the timpani to A flat and E flat for the slow second movement in A flat. In Bruckner's Symphony No. 1 in C minor, however, the timpani are retuned between the first movement in C minor and the following in A-flat major.

Edward Elgar's Symphony No. 1 in A-flat major is probably the best-known symphony in that key. Arnold Bax's last symphony is also in the same key. A-flat major is the major key with the most flats that Domenico Scarlatti used in his keyboard sonatas, though he used it only twice– in K. 127 and K. 130. Felix Mendelssohn and John Field each wrote one piano concerto in A-flat.

[[F minor]]

CATEGORIES: Musical keys, Minor scales

F minor is a minor scale based on F. The harmonic minor raises the Eflat to Enatural.  Its key signature has four flats.

Its relative major is A-flat major, and its parallel major is F major.

F minor is a key that people often link with passion. Some famous pieces in the key of F minor are Beethoven's Appassionata Sonata, Haydn's Symphony No. 49 in F minor, La Passione, and Vivaldi's The Four Seasons.

In the Baroque period, music in F minor was usually written with a three-flat key signature. Some modern printings of such music keeps it written that way.

[[E major]]

CATEGORIES: Musical keys, Major scales

E major is a major scale with a base note of E. Its key signature has four sharps. Its relative minor is C-sharp minor.

E major is hard for wind instruments to play. It is quite good for violin, because two of the open strings are A and E, the tonic and subdominant. Other orchestral string instruments can play well in it, and it is also good for the guitar. When writing in E major, clarinets in A should be used instead of clarinets in B-flat to make it easier to play. This is because clarinets are transposing instruments.

Symphonies in E major are quite rare, but the key is often used for concertos. One of them is Felix Mendelssohn's Violin Concerto.

The bells of the Clock Tower in London's Palace of Westminster are tuned to the key of E major.

[[C-sharp minor]]

CATEGORIES: Musical keys, Minor scales

C-sharp minor or Csharp minor is a minor scale based on Csharp. Its key signature has four sharps.

Its relative major is E major, and its parallel major is C-sharp major.

[[B-flat minor]]

CATEGORIES: Musical keys, Minor scales

Bflat minor or B-flat minor is a minor scale based on B-flat. Its key signature has five flats.

Its relative major is D-flat major, and its parallel major is B-flat major. Its enharmonic equivalent is A-sharp minor.

B-flat minor is often seen as a "dark" key." Tchaikovsky said that the oboe solo in B-flat minor in the second movement of his Symphony No. 4 was "the feeling that you get when you are all alone".

The old valveless horn could not play easily in B-flat minor. In fact, the only example found in 18th century music is a modulation in the first minuet of Franz Krommer's Concertino in D major, Opus 80.

[[B major]]

CATEGORIES: Musical keys, Major scales

B major is a major scale based on B. Its key signature has five sharps.

B major's relative minor is G-sharp minor, its parallel minor is B minor, and its enharmonic equivalent is C-flat major.

The key signature for B major is the least sharp key signature with three "lines" of sharps. In the treble clef, putting the sharp for A where it looks like it should be, next to the sharp for G, would mean that a ledger line would have to be used. In the bass clef it would be possible to do this without a ledger line, but because sight reading is easier when both staves look the same, it is not usually done in piano music. In the alto clef, used in orchestral music, the B major key signature is usually written in just two "lines" of sharps.

Although B major is usually thought of as a "far away" key because it has many sharps and is quite far from C major in the circle of fifths, Frédéric Chopin thought that it was the easiest scale of all to play, as its black notes fit the natural positions of the fingers well. Because of this, it was often the first scale he taught to beginning piano students, leaving the scale of C major till last because he thought it was the hardest to play.

While B major is not too difficult to play on keyboard instruments and guitar, the key of C-flat major is easier when writing music for the harp, as it is that instrument's home key.

[[G-sharp minor]]

CATEGORIES: Musical keys, Minor scales

G-sharp minor is a minor scale based on Gsharp.  For the harmonic minor, the Fsharp is raised to Fdoublesharp.

Its key signature has five sharps.

Its relative major is B major.

The melodic and harmonic versions of the scale are written in with accidentals as necessary.

G-sharp minor is usually not used in orchestral music except to modulate, but it is more common in keyboard music, like Scriabin's sonatas. For orchestration of piano music (writing it so an orchestra can play it), sometimes the music is transposed to G minor or A minor. If G-sharp minor must be used, B-flat wind instruments should have their part written in B-flat minor, not A-sharp minor. 

In a few scores, 5-sharp key signatures in the bass clef are written with the sharp for the A on the top line.

[[G-flat major]]

CATEGORIES: Musical keys, Major scales

G-flat major is a major scale based on G-flat.  Its key signature has six flats.

Its relative minor is E-flat minor, and its parallel minor is G-flat minor. This is usually replaced by F♯ minor because G♭ minor's two double-flats make it generally impractical to use.

Its enharmonic equivalent is F-sharp major, whose key signature also has six accidentals. In writing music in E major for B-flat instruments, it is preferable to use a G-flat rather an F-sharp key signature.

G-flat major is sometimes used as a main key for piano works, such as the impromptus of Chopin and Schubert, but rarely for orchestra.

Austrian composer Gustav Mahler liked to use G-flat major in his symphonies.

[[E-flat minor]]

CATEGORIES: Musical keys, Minor scales

Eflat minor or E-flat minor is a minor scale based on E-flat.  Its key signature has six flats.

Its relative major is G-flat major, and its parallel major is E-flat major. Its enharmonic equivalent is D-sharp minor.

This key is not used much in orchestral music, and usually only to modulate. It is used in some keyboard pieces and has been most popular in Russian pieces. If piano music in this key must be arranged for orchestra, some people recommend transposing it into D minor or E minor.

In book 1 of the Well-Tempered Clavier by Johann Sebastian Bach, Prelude No. 8 is written in E-flat minor while the following Fugue is written in D-sharp minor. In book 2, both movements are in D-sharp minor.

One of the few symphonies written in this key is Prokofiev's Symphony No. 6. A few other Soviet composers also wrote symphonies in this key, such as Eshpai, Janis Ivanovs (fourth symphony Atlantis, 1941), Ovchinnikov and Myaskovsky. Rachmaninov's "Elegie", Op. 3 No. 1 is in E-flat minor, as is his Études-Tableaux Op. 39 #5. These pieces are noted for being dark and mysterious, a mood this key has. This mood is shown even in the later jazz music "'Round Midnight" and "Take Five", which are also in the key.

The second movement to Gustav Mahler's Eighth Symphony has a long orchestral and choral introduction in E-flat minor. The dark orchestral introduction to Beethoven's only oratorio, Christ on the Mount of Olives, is also in this key.

[[F-sharp major]]

CATEGORIES: Musical keys, Major scales

F-sharp major is a major scale based on F-sharp. Its key signature has six sharps.

Its relative minor is Dsharp minor, and its enharmonic equivalent is Gflat major.

[[D-sharp minor]]

CATEGORIES: Musical keys, Minor scales

D-sharp minor is a minor scale based on D sharp.  For the harmonic minor, the Csharp is raised to C##.  Its key signature has six sharps.

E-flat minor is its enharmonic equivalent.  Its relative major is F-sharp major, and its parallel major is D-sharp major. This is usually replaced by E-flat major, because D-sharp major's two double sharps make it impractical to use.

Since D-sharp minor and its enharmonic equivalent both have key signatures of six accidentals, neither one is clearly used instead of the other. For example, using the melodic minor version of D-sharp minor on the harp is very difficult. The B-pedal can be set to the sharp position, but there is no double-sharp position to set the C-pedal at. In Book I of The Well-Tempered Clavier, Bach chose to write the eighth prelude in E-flat minor but the accompanying fugue in D-sharp minor. (In Book II, Bach wrote both the eighth Prelude and Fugue in D-sharp minor.)

Music written in this key is considered very difficult to read, which means that little music was written mainly in this key in the Classical era. E-flat minor is easier for many brass instruments and woodwinds.

The most famous work in this key is Scriabin's famous Etude Op. 8, No. 12. Russian composer Lyapunov must also have liked the key because he wrote the second etude of his Op. 11 set in the key, and also fifteen years later his Variations on a Russian Theme, Op. 49.  His early Piano Concerto No. 1, Op. 4 was also in the enharmonic key of E-flat minor.

In a few scores, 6-sharp key signatures in the bass clef are written with the sharp for the A on the top line. This is not done often, because it is different from the treble clef.

This key is not used often in orchestral music, but is used more in keyboard music. When arranging this piano music for orchestra, some people recommend transposing the music to D minor or E minor. If D-sharp minor must be used,  B-flat wind instruments should have their parts written in F minor, rather than E-sharp minor.

[[A-flat minor]]

CATEGORIES: Musical keys, Minor scales

A-flat minor is a minor scale starting on Aflat.  Its key signature has seven flats.

Its relative major is C-flat major, and its parallel major is A-flat major. Its enharmonic equivalent is G-sharp minor.

A-flat minor is rarely used as the main key of a piece of music. 

More often, pieces in a minor mode that have Aflat as the tonic are written in the enharmonic key, G-sharp minor, because it has a simpler key signature.  Because of this, there are few works in A-flat minor.

In some scores, the Aflat minor key signature in the bass clef is written with the flat for the F on the second line from the top.

==In classical music== 

[[C-sharp major]]

CATEGORIES: Musical keys, Major scales

Csharp major (or C-sharp major) is a major scale based on Csharp. Its key signature has seven sharps.

Its relative minor is Asharp minor, and its parallel minor is Csharp minor. Its enharmonic equivalent is Dflat major.

When a harp is tuned to C-sharp major, it has all its pedals in the bottom position. Because all the strings are made shorter in this way, it makes it less resonant.

Most composers prefer to use the enharmonic equivalent D-flat major because it has just five flats. However, Johann Sebastian Bach actually chose C-sharp major for Prelude and Fugue No. 3 in both books of the Well-Tempered Clavier. In Hungarian Rhapsody No. 6, Franz Liszt changes key from D-flat major to C-sharp major near the beginning of the piece. Maurice Ravel used C-sharp major as the tonic key of Ondine from his piano suite Gaspard de la nuit. 

Louis Vierne used C-sharp major in the final piece of Messe solennelle.

[[A-sharp minor]]

CATEGORIES: Musical keys, Minor scales

A-sharp minor or Asharp minor is a minor scale based on A-sharp. Its key signature has seven sharps.

Its relative major is C-sharp major.  Its parallel major is A-sharp major.  This is usually replaced by B-flat major, because A-sharp major's three double sharps in the key signature makes it generally impractical.  Exceptions include Chopin's Polonaise-Fantaisie in A-flat major, Op. 61, which has a short passage of about 6 bars actually written in A-sharp major, putting in the necessary double-sharps as accidentals.  This is part of a theme in B major, which modulates to A-sharp major for a little while.

A-sharp minor has the enharmonic equivalent of B-flat minor. This is often used in most musical compositions instead of A-sharp minor, because A-sharp minor is not a useful key for compositions and is one of the least used minor keys in music. However, there were some composers in the past that have composed music in this key. Christian Heinrich Rinck wrote his Prelude No. 16 from Op. 15 in A-sharp minor.

[[F-flat major]]

CATEGORIES: Musical keys, Major scales

F-flat major is a major scale based on F-flat.  Its key signature has eight flats.

Its relative minor is D-flat minor, and its parallel minor is F-flat minor, usually replaced by E minor.

Part of Richard Strauss' Metamorphosen uses F flat major, which one commentator has called "a bitter enharmonic parody" of the earlier manifestations of E major in the piece.

To make reading and writing music easier, F-flat major is usually written as its enharmonic equivalent of E major.

[[D-flat minor]]

CATEGORIES: Musical keys, Minor scales

D-flat minor is a theoretical key based on the musical note Dflat. Its key signature has seven flats and one double flat.

Because it has so many flats, Dflat minor is usually written as its enharmonic equivalent of Csharp minor. For example, Mahler's thematic motif "der kleine Appell" ("call to order") from his Fourth and Fifth Symphonies is written in Dflat minor in Symphony No.4, but in his Symphony No. 5 it is in Csharp minor. In the Adagio of his Symphony No. 9 a solo bassoon theme appears first in Dflat minor, but comes back two more times notated in Csharp minor. The Adagio of Bruckner's Symphony No. 8, also has phrases that are tonally in Dflat minor but written as Csharp minor.

[[G-sharp major]]

CATEGORIES: Musical keys, Major scales

G-sharp major is a major scale based on the musical note G sharp. Its key signature has six sharps and one double sharp.

To make reading easier, G-sharp major is usually written as its enharmonic equivalent of A-flat major. However, it does appear as a secondary key area in several works in sharp keys, for example in the Prelude and Fugue in C sharp major from Bach's Well-Tempered Klavier, Book 1. The G sharp minor Prelude and Fugue from the same set end with a Picardy third in G sharp major. 

G sharp major is used for a short time in several of Chopin's nocturnes in C sharp minor. 

[[Flat (music)]]

CATEGORIES: Musical notation

In music, flat, or Bemolle, means "lower in pitch." In music notation, flat means "lower in pitch by a semitone (half step)," and has the symbol (flat).  The Unicode character 'flat' (U+266D) is the flat sign. Its HTML entity is &#9837;.

Under twelve tone equal temperament, C flat is the same as, or enharmonically equivalent to, B natural, and G flat is the same as F sharp.

Double flats also exist, which look like doubleflat and lower a note by two semitones, or a whole step. Sometimes you will encounter half or three-quarter flats. The Unicode character '𝄫' 𝄫 (U+1D12B) represents the double flat sign.

A triple flat can be found, but it is very rare.  It lowers a note three semitones. 

The note A flat is shown in musical notation in Figure 1, together with A double flat. anab.ogg

In tuning, flat can also mean "slightly lower in pitch". If the same note is played on two instruments at the same time, the lower-pitched one is flat compared to the higher-pitched one.

A half flat, showing quarter tones, is sometimes shown with a flat with a slash () or a reversed flat sign. A three-quarter flat is represented by a half flat and a regular flat.

[[Sharp (music)]]

CATEGORIES: Musical notation

In music, sharp, or Diese, means higher in pitch.  In musical notation, sharp means "higher in pitch by a semitone (half step)," and looks like this:(sharp).

Under twelve-tone equal temperament, B sharp, for instance, is enharmonically equivalent to (sounds the same as), C natural, and G sharp is enharmonically equivalent to A flat.

Double sharps also exist; these have the symbol doublesharp and raise a note by two semitones, or a whole step. Less often there are half or three-quarter sharps.

Although very rare and used only in modern classical music, a triple sharp (sharp doublesharp) can sometimes be found. This raises a note by three semitones.

The Circle of fifths tells you how many sharps are in a key signature.

In tuning, sharp can also mean "slightly higher in pitch". If the same note is played on two instruments, and one is slightly higher, it is too sharp compared to the other.

In Unicode, the sharp symbol (♯) is at code point U+266F. Its HTML entity is &#9839;. The double sharp symbol (𝄪) is at U+1D12A. Some fonts do not show these symbols.

[[Theoretical key]]

CATEGORIES: Musical notation

In music theory, theoretical keys or impossible keys are keys with key signatures that contain at least one double-flats or double-sharps.

Double-flats and double-sharps are used in music as accidentals, but they are rarely placed in the key signature (in music that uses equal temperament), because it would make reading the key signature very difficult.

For example, the key of Gsharp major is rarely used to write music down, because its key signature has an Fdoublesharp. An equal-tempered scale of Gsharp major has exactly the same notes as the Aflat major scale. Key pairs like this are called enharmonically equivalent. So the theoretical key of Gsharp major is usually written with the key signature of Aflat major.

Aron Nimzowitsch (7 November 1886 – 16 March 1935) was a Jewish Latvian-born Danish chess grandmaster, and a very influential chess writer. He was the foremost figure amongst the hypermoderns.

He wrote an important text on chess strategy called My system: a chess treatise, which is still highly regarded. It is a foundation of modern positional chess, and has been read by most chess masters since then. In it he reacted against the more classical views of Siegbert Tarrasch. Later he wrote Chess praxis (1929), a collection of his games showing his ideas in practice.

Nimzowitsch was the subject of a chess biography by English grandmaster Ray Keene, which was translated into Russian in 1986.

[[Goliath]]

CATEGORIES: Old Testament people

Goliath (גָּלְיָת,) was a Philistine warrior in the Old Testament. He was the champion of the warriors of town of Gath. The name refers to Greek name Alyattes.

Goliath was unusually large. His height was said to be "six cubits and a span"  - some 290 cm - and he fought as armoured charioteer. The Bible describes how he challenged the Israelite warriors for single-handed duel, but nobody dared to fight with him.

David, who was fourteen years old at this time, finally answered to challenge. He was skilled on use of sling, and he found out a way how he could win him. He accurately slung a stone on Goliath's forehead, just below his helmet. The stone knocked Goliath out. David then ran to unconscious Goliath, pulled his sword off the scabbard, and cut his head off. Seeing a fourteen-year-old boy killing their champion, the Philistine army demoralized.

The Dead Sea Scrolls say Goliath's height was a more credible "four cubits and a span", in modern measurements 202 cm. At the era when man's average height was some 160 cm, he would still have looked like a giant.

[[Areopagitica]]

CATEGORIES: 1644 books, Non-fiction books

Areopagitica is a book written by English poet John Milton in 1644.  He wrote it to protest against censorship. Its full title is Areopagitica: A speech of Mr. John Milton for the liberty of unlicensed printing to the Parliament of England. Today, his book is called a tract. In the tract, Milton tries to defend the freedom of expression. Today, many people see it as one of the best defenses of the freedom of press ever written.

The tract is named after a speech by Isocrates, a Greek orator of the 5th century. The Areopagus is a hill in Athens, where many councils and tribunals were held. Isocrates wanted to restore one of these tribunals when he wrote the speech. In the  speech,Milton argued that the Licensing Order of 1643 should be abolished; censorship had not been part of Greek or Roman societies. Milton uses many passages from the Bible to strengthen his argument. Milton had been censored himself when he tried to publish tracts which were in favor of allowing people to get divorced. 

In Areopagitica, Milton argues that the status that was there before had worked best: By this law, all publications needed an authors name or that of a publisher. According to Milton, it is easy to find the authors or the publishers with this system. So if anything libelous is published, the books can still be destroyed after the fact.

[[Defamation]]

CATEGORIES: Types of crime

Defamation is saying or writing something about another person that hurts their reputation. Usually, when people use the word defamation, it means that the statement is not true.  In this case, it is against the law. A statement that is defamation is called defamatory.

In order to be defamatory, a statement has to claim to be a fact instead of an opinion. For example, saying, "Mr. Jones is mean" cannot be defamatory, because it is someone's opinion. However, if someone says, "Mr. Jones steals candy from children", then the statement is defamatory if it is not true, because it would be a fact, not an opinion.

If a defamatory statement is written, such as in a book or in a newspaper, it is called libel. If it is spoken out loud, it is called slander. Somebody who is the victim of defamation can sue the person who wrote or said it.

Defamation is a tool of bullying.

[[Rachel Carson]]

Rachel Louise Carson (born May 27, 1907 – died April 14, 1964) was an American marine biologist and nature writer.  Carson worked for 15 years as a biologist, scientist and editor in the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries and then the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. Her books were very important in helping the environmental movement grow.  She was famous for writing Silent Spring.  She also wrote a set of three books about the ocean and what lives in and around it.

Silent Spring caught the attention of many Americans.  Before this not many worried about environmental problems and conservation.  The book looked at problems with DDT and other pesticides (chemicals that kill pests, like mosquitoes and flies). It was thought these pesticides were safe, but they were actually causing many birds to die.  DDT stayed in insects and fish which were eaten by birds.  The birds then laid eggs with thin shells that would break. Some birds, like the Bald Eagle almost disappeared from the United States.  In her book Carson said that without changes in how we use pesticides, there may not be birds left at some time in the future.  Instead of hearing birds sing in the spring, it would be quiet, and that is how the book got its title.

This book led to a change in the national pesticide policy and a ban on DDT and some other pesticides.  This new grassroots environmental movement, inspired by the book, led to the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency.  After her death, Carson was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Jimmy Carter. There is a National Wildlife Refuge in Maine named after her.

[[Heterochrony]]

CATEGORIES: Developmental biology, Evolutionary biology

Heterochrony (= different time) is any change in the timing of development in an animal or plant. It is a key concept in developmental biology and evolution, introduced by Ernst Haeckel in 1875. It applies to the time a trait appears in the growth of an organism, or to the timing of gene expression in development.p203

Its importance in biology is to explain the way closely related animals may come to have quite large differences in shape, and size, whilst nevetheless having a rather similar genome. The main components are the time a process starts and stops in development, and the rate at which the process works. 

In his book Embryos and evolution (1930) Gavin de Beer stressed the importance of heterochrony, and especially paedomorphosis, in evolution. Changes to the genes which control timing in development can produce quite striking changes in the adult. de Beer also conceived the idea of clandestine evolution, which helped to explain the sudden changes in the fossil record which were apparently at odds with Darwin's gradual theory of evolution. If a novelty were to evolve gradually in an animal's juvenile form, then its development would not appear in the fossil record at all. Then, if the species were to undergo neoteny, the feature would appear suddenly in the fossil record, despite having evolved gradually. Stephen Jay Gould commented on this book:

[[Neoteny]]

CATEGORIES: Developmental biology, Evolutionary biology

Neoteny is a type of heterochrony where bodily development is slowed, but sexual development goes on at the same rate. This results in a sexually mature juvenile or larval form. A classic example is the Axolotl.

It has often been suggested that the human species is, at least to some extent, an example of neoteny. These features of adult humans are different from those of adult great apes, but more similar to those of juvenile apes:

These are some of the neotenous traits in humans: flattened face, broadened face, large brain, hairless body, hairless face, small nose, reduction of brow ridge, small teeth, small upper jaw (maxilla), small lower jaw (mandible), thinness of skull bones, limbs proportionately short compared to torso length, longer leg than arm length, larger eyes, and upright stance.

Sir Gavin Rylands de Beer FRS (1899–1972) was a British evolutionary embryologist. He was Director of the London Natural History Museum, President of the Linnean Society, and received the Royal Society's Darwin Medal for his studies on evolution.

In the First World War he served in the Grenadier Guards. Later, he taught at Oxford University zoology department. In 1938, he was made Reader in Embryology at University College London. During the Second World War de Beer again served with the Grenadier Guards reaching the rank of temporary lieutenant colonel. He worked in military intelligence, propaganda and psychological warfare. Also during the war, in 1940, he was elected Fellow of the Royal Society.

In 1945, de Beer became Professor of Zoology and was, from 1946 to 1949, President of the Linnean Society. Then he was Director of the British Museum (Natural History) from 1950 until his retirement in 1960. He was knighted in 1954, and awarded the Darwin Medal of the Royal Society in 1957.

Hate speech is communicating in a way that is meant to offend and hurt somebody. It is usually based on a factor such as somebody's race, gender, ethnic group, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability or religion. Some places have laws that make it illegal to use hate speech. Countries such as Canada, France and Germany have stricter laws against hate speech than the United States, where hate speech is usually legal because its Constitution says that people have freedom of speech.

But hate speech is an inciting of discrimination and sometimes a cause of bullying or hate crime and Article 7 of Universal Declaration of Human Rights affirms that all are protected from such an inciting.

[[Numerical weather prediction]]

CATEGORIES: Weather

Numerical weather prediction is the way weather forecasts are made.  This is done using computer models of the atmosphere. Such models describe the current weather conditions, and how they change over time using equations. Using the current weather conditions, the equations can be solved, or approximated to tell what the weather will be like in the near future. The relevant physical parameters, such as pressure, temperature, the direction and the speed of the wind are taken to be functions of time. These are modelled with a system of partial differential equations. This is a dynamic system that is solved numerically. Most of these equations are implemented using FORTRAN. The equations are approximated. Since the number of calculations is huge, supercomputers usually do them, to finish before it's too late.
