[[Third Estate]]

Many states in the Middle Ages of Europe had a system of three classes (estates) - the first estate, the second estate and the third estate. The first and second estates paid low taxes and enjoyed the facilities provided to them. In France in the 18th century the third estate paid 60% taxes, food was not provided to them and they were mostly peasants or farmers so they could not get much money. 

After the money in treasury was spent, the king called a meeting of the three estates. He asked the estates to pay more taxes. The first and second estates walked out, and the king let them. The third estate however, was asked to do the heavy lifting again, and pay more tax. They didn't accept and took a pledge called the tennis court pledge and protested against the king. They got thrown in jail, but the rest of the third estate bailed them out.

This act of bravery led to the execution of the last ruler of the Bourbon Dynasty and the end of monarchy.

Doom Eternal is the sequel to the video game Doom (2016). It can be now be played on the PC, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4. The Nintendo Switch version will be playable at a later time.

Similar to the story of Doom 2, the demons from Hell invade Earth. According to Id Software, they hoped to expand the Doom story much more than in the earlier Doom games. Places where the player goes include Earth, Mars, Phobos (one of Mars's moons), Sentinel Prime, Argent d'Nur, Nekravol, and even the game's version of Heaven, Urdak. Some of these planets have been taken over or are being taken over by the Hell dimension.

The monsters and weapons have been redesigned so that they look more like the ones in Doom and Doom 2. Each weapon received new attachments, so they play differently than they did in Doom (2016). The game also added new mechanics like extra lives, wall-climbing, air-dashing, swinging from monkey bars, and swinging from grappling hooks. The player also received a flamethrower so that they can gain armor points when they damage inflamed enemies. The game is designed where certain body parts of the demon enemies can be damaged, so attacking and destroying those body parts can disable certain attacks and make them easier to kill.

The game is designed to be much more difficult than the earlier games because the player has much less ammunition and the enemies are more aggressive.

The game has multiplayer like its prequel, but there is a new mechanic called Invasion Mode where players can play as demons and invade other players' campaigns to kill them, though Id Software said that players allowing this feature in their own campaigns would be up to themselves.

Pramoedya Ananta Toer (6 February 1925 – 30 April 2006) was an Indonesian writer. He wrote novels, short stories, essays, and histories of Indonesia and its people. His writing includes much personal and national history. The Dutch Government put him in prison him from 1947 to 1949. Later, the Suharto government sent him to a prison island from 1965 to 1979.

Colonial and later authoritarian governments did not approve of Pramoedya's writings. They often censored his writing in Indonesia even though he was well known outside his home country. The Dutch imprisoned him from 1947 to 1949 during the War of Independence. During the coup when Suharto gained power, Pramoedya was involved in political fighting. Suharto put him in prison from 1969 to 1979 on the Maluku island called Buru. Suharto called Pramoedya a Communist. Suharto thought Pramoedya was still loyal to the Sukarno government even though Pramoedya had struggled with Sukarno.

He created his most famous work, the Buru Quartet, on the prison island. The prison did not allow him to have writing materials, so he told the story aloud to other prisoners. Then it was written down and smuggled out.

Pramoedya was against some policies of Indonesia's first President, Sukarno, and against the New Order regime of Suharto. Often, he did not make direct political criticisms. His writing was subtle. He was outspoken against colonialism, racism and the corruption of the Indonesian Government. During the many years he suffered in prison and house arrest, human rights advocates fought for his freedom of expression.

Millook is a place on the north coast of Cornwall. It has these remarkable cliffs. The cliffs at Millook  are so famous they were voted by the Geological Society as one of Britain's top 10 geological sites. They came top of the "folding and faulting" category. 

The cliffs have a  series of horizontal chevron folds. The rocks were once sedimentary rocks laid down in deep water during the Devonian and Carboniferous periods. We know this because they still contain brachiopod fossils of a type which lived in the late Devonian period. Later they were altered by heat from granite during mountain building in the English counties of Devon and Cornwall.

The Variscan orogeny caused the intrusion of the hot granite. The subsequent contact with the sandstones created the metamorphic rocks seen today. This also put intense pressure on the sediments causing them to be folded and faulted. What we see is a small part of a huge mountain system    caused by a continental collision between Euramerica (Laurussia) and Gondwana. This formed the supercontinent of Pangaea.

[[Stoneware]]

CATEGORIES: Pottery

Stoneware is a broad term for pottery or other ceramics fired at a relatively high temperature. It may or may not be glazed. It was developed after earthenware and before porcelain. Stoneware can be made from a much wider range of clays than porcelain.

Historically, reaching high temperatures was a big challenge. Lower temperatures were used for a long time. Earthenware can be fired as low as 600°C. This was done in primitive pit firing, but 800 to 1,100 was more typical.  

As a rough guide, modern earthenwares are normally fired in a kiln at temperatures in the range of about 1,000°C (1,830 °F) to 1,200; stonewares at between about 1100  to 1300; and porcelains at between about 1200  to 1400.

His official life extended throughout the Whig supremacy of the 18th century.

He was a protégé of Sir Robert Walpole, and served under him for more than 20 years until 1742. He held power with his brother, Prime Minister Henry Pelham, until 1754. By then he had served as a Secretary of State continuously for 30 years and dominated British foreign policy.

After Henry's death, the Duke of Newcastle was prime minister for six years in two separate periods. His first premiership (17541756) was not particularly notable: Newcastle partly caused the Seven Years' War, and his weak diplomacy cost him the premiership. After his second term (17571762), he served briefly in Lord Rockingham's ministry, before he retired from government. He was most effective as a deputy to a leader of greater ability, such as Walpole, his brother, or William Pitt the Elder.

[[Wing coupling]]

CATEGORIES: Lepidoptera

Wing coupling is common in some four-winged insects such as moths. It makes them "functionally dipterous". They are effectively two-winged. The advantage is more efficient flight. 

In many moths the wing coupling is done by a tiny hook going round a tiny spur. In butterflies and some moths the wing coupling is got by wing overlap, rather than hooks.

Sphingid moths have been much studied for their flying ability, especially their ability to move rapidly from side to side while hovering, called "swing-hovering" or "side-slipping". This is thought to have evolved to deal with ambush predators that lie in wait in flowers.

[[Bitburg controversy]]

CATEGORIES: 20th century in Germany, Presidency of Ronald Reagan

The Bitburg controversy involved a ceremonial visit by U.S. President Ronald Reagan to a German military cemetery in Bitburg, a town in extreme western Germany near the border with Luxembourg, in May 1985, designed to celebrate the end of World War II in Europe 40 years earlier. 

The visit caused some controversy, both in the United States and around the world, when it became known that members of the Waffen-SS, the military arm of Nazi Germany's SS (Schutzstaffel), were also buried there. The entire SS was judged to be a criminal organisation at the Nuremberg trials. The fact that Reagan had not been scheduled to visit former Nazi concentration-camp sites compounded the controversy, and a trip to Bergen-Belsen concentration camp was later added to his itinerary.

On Sunday 5 May, Reagan and Kohl appeared at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. The U.S. President's speech there, according to Time, was a "skillful exercise in both the art of eulogy and political damage control." Reagan said:

Reagan responded about the controversy: "This visit has stirred many emotions in the American and German people too. Some old wounds have been reopened, and this I regret very much, because this should be a time of healing."

CATEGORIES: Chordates

A salp  is a barrel-shaped, planktic tunicate. 

Salps moves by contracting. This pumps water through their gelatinous bodies. It is one of the most efficient examples of jet propulsion in the animal kingdom. 

The salp pumps water through its internal feeding filters and feeds on phytoplankton.

Salps are common in all seas. The most salps are in the Southern Ocean (near Antarctica), where they may form enormous swarms, often in deep water. They are sometimes even more abundant than krill.

Although salps look similar to jellyfish with their simple body form and behaviour, in fact they are chordates. This means they are animals with a dorsal nerve cord. They are related to vertebrates, animals with backbones.

An HI region or H I region (H one) is a cloud in the interstellar medium composed of neutral atomic hydrogen (HI).

These regions do not emit detectable visible light (except in spectral lines from metal elements).  

H I regions are clouds of neutral hydrogen which glow faintly with infrared light. Because they are common in our galaxy, they obscure distant views at extreme ultraviolet and soft x-ray wavelengths. An exception is the Lockman Hole, through which we have a fairly clear window to distant objects. 

Another window into deep space is the Chandra Deep Field South. This was chosen for the Chandra X-ray Observatory satellite.

From our position in the Milky Way galaxy, most directions are partly blocked or obscured by  H I clouds of neutral hydrogen. These glow faintly with infrared light and obscure distant views at extreme ultraviolet and soft x-ray wavelengths.  

The H I clouds interfere with observations at those wavelengths in nearly all other directions. So the Lockman Hole is an attractive area of the sky for observational astronomy surveys. It is near the pointer stars of the Big Dipper in the constellation Ursa Major.  is about 15 square degrees in size, and is named after its discoverer, astronomer Jay Lockman.

[[Planck epoch]]

CATEGORIES: Cosmology

The Planck epoch is the earliest period of time in the history of the universe, before the time passed was equal to the Planck time (tₚ) ; that is from zero to approximately 10⁻⁴³ seconds. The Planck scale is the physical scale beyond which current physical theories may not apply and cannot be used to calculate what happened. At this time scale, every physical quantities like temperature, energies etc were in the range of Planck units values. During the Planck epoch, the temperature and average energies within the universe were so high that even subatomic particles could not form and even the four fundamental forces that shape our universe were combined and formed one unified fundamental force.

Traditional Big Bang cosmology predicts a gravitational singularity before this time, but this theory relies on the theory of general relativity, which is thought to break down for this epoch due to quantum effects. Due to the extraordinarily small scale of the universe at that time, the quantum effects of gravity were the strongest and it is believed that cosmology and physics are assumed to have been dominated by the quantum effects of gravity. At this scale, the unified force is assumed to be unified with gravitation. Immeasurably hot and dense state of the Planck epoch is succeeded by the grand unification epoch, where gravitation force is separated from the unified fundamental force.

[[Golden algae]]

CATEGORIES: Algae

The Chrysophyceae (golden-brown algae or golden algae) are a large group of algae found mostly in freshwater. 

Golden algae is also a common term. It refers to a  species, Prymnesium parvum, which kills fish in large numbers (causes 'fish kills').

The main type of chrysophyte cell has two specialized flagella. The active, "feathered"  flagellum points toward the moving direction. The smooth passive flagellum, points in the opposite direction.

An important characteristic used to identify members of the  Chrysophyceae is the presence of a siliceous cyst that is formed internally.

However, some members of the group are amoeboid (move like amoeba), and some are sessile. Unfortunately, every expert who has studied this group has come up with a different classification. It seems that their ancestor did not do photosynthesis, but later on groups separately evolved their own methods of using sunlight.

CATEGORIES: Geography

Before the Aswan Dam was built (1898-1902). there was a Nile flood, once a year. This flood carried rich sediments, which made the soil fertile. Egypt is located in the desert, and agriculture is only possible close to the Nile. A rainy season in Ethiopia starts the flooding, which used to occur between May and August. During this time, the Blue Nile has five times as much water as the White Nile. During the rest of the year, the White Nile has almost twice as much water than the Blue Nile. This event was visible in Aswan, starting in June, and reaching its peak in August. The water reaches the eastuary of the Nile about two weeks later. 

The flooding always occurs at the same time; in some years it may be a few days erlier, in others it will be a few days later. What cannot be prediced is the total amount of water. Little water meant droughts and famine. Too much water would cause damage to dams and houses.

[[Quwwat-ul-Islam mosque]]

CATEGORIES: Buildings and structures in India, Mamluk dynasty (Delhi), Monuments and memorials, Mughal architecture, World Heritage Sites in India

Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque (built 1192 - 1316) Quwwat-ul-Islam was sponsored by Qutb-ud-din Aibak, founder of the Mamluk dynasty. The Quwwat-ul-Islam is best known for its tower of victory, celebrating the Muslim conquest of India. It is also known as Rai Pithora ka Mahal. Located to the north-east of Qutb minar,it was built by Qutub-ud-Din Aibak in 1198 A.D.. It is the earliest extant mosque built by the Delhi Sultans. It consists of a rectangular courtyard enclosed by cloisters, erected with the carved columns and architectural members of 27 Hindu and Jaina temples, which were demolished by Qutub-ud-Din Aibak as recorded in his inscription on the main eastern entrance. Perhaps it was the first monument of iconoclast in India. It is in contradiction to Hasan Nizami's account of Aibak as peaceful and 'Lakh Baksh' or 'giver of lakhs' in his book Taj-ul-Masir. It is said he was generous and spent huge sums in charity.But it may also be that the monument was hurriedly built with the building material from the temple as Aibak had not established himself firmly in India at that time.

Qutb was a fanatical Muslim. When his garrison occupied Delhi under the command of Muhammed Ghori in 1192, he ordered the destruction of twenty-seven Hindu and Jain temples to furnish building materials for the construction of Delhi's first mosque. Quwwat-ul-Islam, the "Glory of Islam," was hastily erected by the young amir, who conscripted an army of local craftsmen, presumably Hindus, to assemble the structure. The Hindu stonemasons repurposed columns from the destroyed temples, but adapting them to use in a mosque proved problematic given Islam's injunction against the use of images in temples. The masons were forced to plaster over the highly sculpted Hindu columns and presumably cover them with geometric designs. However, after centuries of neglect the plaster has fallen away, revealing the original Hindu carvings.

The Quwwat-ul-Islam is best known for its tower of victory, celebrating the Muslim conquest of India. It is built of red sandstone, gray quartz, and white marble, but is probably inspired by the iron "Pillar of the Law" that stands on the site. Built in the Mauryan dynasty in the 6th century, it is the only piece of the temple that stands in its original location. Qutb built around it when he constructed the mosque. Although made of iron, it has resisted rust for over 1,500 years, evidence of the Mauryan's superb metallurgical skills.

Later, a lofty arched screen was erected and the mosque was enlarged, by Shams-ud- Din Iltutmish (A.D. 1210 - 1235) and Ala-ud-Din Khalji. The Iron Pillar in the courtyard bears an inscription in Sanskrit in Brahmi script of fourth century A.D., according to which the pillar was set up as a Vishnudhvaja (standard of god Vishnu) on the hill known as Vishnupada in memory of a mighty king named Chandra. A deep socket on the top of the ornate capital indicates that probably an image of Garuda was fixed into it.

[[Larinus planus]]

CATEGORIES: Polyphaga

Larinus planus is a weevil, an insect of the Curculionidae family. It is native to Europe, and is also common in North America. Both the larvae and adults feed on flower buds, mostly of thistles. They are oval shaped, dark brown or black, and about 5-10 millimeters long.

The larvae stage does the most damage to the flower bud. In North America it has been used as a biocontrol agent.

Larinus planus has been used to control the Canada thistle. It has spread to other plants. In 2000, it was found eating  Cirsium undulatum. This is a thistle native to western Colorado and eastern Utah. Later research found that it had reduced the amount of seeds produced by the native thistle. It has also been found to have a bad effect on Cirsium pitcheri.

It is normal for introduced species to spread rapidly because they are free of the parasites and predators of their native land.

[[Flemish Giant Rabbit]]

CATEGORIES: Domesticated animals, Lagomorphs

The Flemish Giant Rabbit is one of the largest breeds of domestic rabbits, earning the name, "King of Rabbits." Originally, these rabbits were bred for their fur and meat. It's origins are quite vague. It is believed that these rabbits are descended from the Patagonia Rabbit, possibly crossed with another rabbit. Also, no one is sure as to what region these rabbits are from.

The difference in does (females) and bucks (males) can be told by looking at their head. Bucks have a broader head while does' are dainty and have a dewlap, a fold of skin under their chin, used to keep kits (baby rabbits) warm.

The Flemish Giant Rabbit has other nicknames besides "King of Rabbits." The name "Gentle Giants" was earned because unlike the smaller domestic rabbit, Flemish Giants are known for being much more calm and gentle. They are also called the "Universal Rabbit" mainly for being great pets and show animals, although, it could also be because of their use as a resource for food and material.

The 2019 Hyderabad gang rape was the murder of a 26 year old veterinary doctor. It had an effect across all of India.

Her body was found in Shadnagar on 28 November 2019, a day after her death. Four suspects were arrested and, according to the Cyberabad Metropolitan Police, confessed to having raped and killed the doctor. On 6 December, the police took the accused to the scene of the crime, and shot them dead, prompting accusations of extrajudicial execution and celebrations of the killings. https://www.afp.com/en/news/15/indian-police-kill-rape-murder-suspects-sparking-celebrations-doc-1mu58f4

The following account is based on the police report. The victim had parked her scooter near a toll plaza, and caught the attention of two lorry drivers and their assistants. They  deflated her tire, pretended to help her, and pushed her into nearby bushes, where they raped and smothered her. Then they loaded her corpse onto a lorry and dropped it on the roadside.

The police got evidence  from CCTV cameras and from the victim's mobile phone. The accused were arrested and put in Cherlapally Central Jail for fourteen days. The Telangana Chief Minister ordered a fast-track court to try the accused for their alleged crimes. 

The rape and murder caused outrage in several parts of the country. Protests and public demonstration against rape were organised nationwide after the incident, with the public demanding stricter laws against rape and rapists.  The Minister of Home Affairs criticised the Telangana Police and stated that the government intended to amend the Indian Penal Code and Code of Criminal Procedure to introduce laws for quicker punishment by fast-track courts.

All four accused were killed in by police on 6 December 2019, under a bridge on Bangalore Hyderabad national highway, while they were in police custody. According to the police, the suspects were taken there for a reconstruction of the crime scene.  Two of them allegedly snatched guns and attacked the police. In the ensuing shootout, all four suspects were shot dead. 

Thousands of people celebrated the men's deaths. The event has no religious angle: the accused included men of both main religions.

[[FrogPhone]]

CATEGORIES: Frogs, Mobile phones released in 2019, Audio technology, Habitats

The FrogPhone is a machine that uses microphones to listen to frogs so scientists can study them and the places they live.  It also has thermometers to measure how hot or cold it is in the air and water.

Scientists plan to place the FrogPhone machine in a swamp or other place where frogs live and then leave.  The FrogPhone works off of two lithium batteries that are recharged by a solar panel.  This way, the humans do not have to come back to change the batteries, so they do not disturb the plants or animals.

Scientists can use their cellular phones to call the FrogPhone and either listen to what is happening where the FrogPhone is at that time or make a recording to listen to later or to send to a database for other people.  FrogPhone only works in places that have 3G/4G cell phone coverage, but scientists think it could be used with satellites in the future.

[[FrogWatch]]

CATEGORIES: Frogs, Scientific organizations, Citizen science organizations

FrogWatch is a name shared by citizen science programs that do the same thing. In a FrogWatch, people make recordings of frogs and other amphibians that live near them and send the recordings to databases for scientists and other people to hear and study.

Not all FrogWatch programs are run by the same people.  The Association of Zoos and Aquariums runs FrogWatch USA, Nature Canada runs FrogWatch Canada, the India Biodiversity Portal runs the FrogWatch in India, and other organizations run FrogWatches in other countries.

In citizen science, scientists ask ordinary people to help with scientific research or other work.  Citizen science is one kind of crowdsourcing.

The National Geographic Society developed the program that FrogWatch USA volunteers use to add information and that FrogWatch uses to study it.  Volunteers record temperature with thermometers and listen for sounds made by specific types of frogs and toads.  FrogWatch USA volunteers listen to and record frog habitats for three and a half minutes, starting one half-hour (30 minutes) after the sun goes down.

Scientists have used FrogWatch to study the way frogs and toads change the places they live, which types of frogs are becoming more numerous and which are becoming less numerous, how many different kinds of frogs live in one place, the way they react to changes in how hot or cold it is, and the way they act during different parts of the year.

[[Obazoa]]

CATEGORIES: Eukaryotes

The Obazoa is made up of Breviatea, Apusomonadida and Opisthokonta. It does not include Amoebozoa, because that is a different clade. The connections between opisthokonts, breviates and apusomonads are not well known yet. Probably the Breviatea are the most basic of the three groups. RNA phylogenies (evolution clues) do not give much evidence that Obazoa is a clade. This could still mean Obazoa is from a very old ancestor, and there are not many clues left (because of its age).

[[Tantric yoga]]

CATEGORIES: Yoga, Religion

Tantric yoga is a religious belief. This ancient practice is actually a powerful combination of asana, mantra, mudra, and bandha (energy lock) and chakra (energy center) work that you can use to build strength, clarity, and bliss in everyday life. By harnessing and embodying the five forces of Shakti, the female deity that represents creativity and change, Tantric Yoga suggests we can move through the world with more confidence and contentment.

The simple principle of tantra yoga is: whatever can take you down can also take you up. The ways in which a man usually sinks in his life are through food, alcoholic drink and sexuality. Tantra yoga uses the same three vehicles to rise up.

Tantric practices, including Tantra yoga, work on the subtle energies within the body to enhance spiritual growth and physical wellbeing. Through the exploration of these energies and their connection to the universe, the purpose of life and the connection to others can be understood in a new dimension.
