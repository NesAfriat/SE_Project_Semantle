The Dungan people are ethnic Muslims that came from from China who live in regions of the former Soviet Union and Xinjiang. Their ancestors are the Hui people in China. Russians and Turkic-speaking peoples call them Dungan, but the Dungan call themselves Hui because that is what their ancestors called themselves. 

The Dungan language came from Mandarin Chinese, and it is most like the dialects in Gansu and Shaanxi provinces in China. The Dungan call their language the Hui language. Like Chinese, it is a tonal language. However, it is different from Chinese because it uses some words that are no longer used in Chinese dialects today. There are also many Arabic and Persian loanwords. Unlike Chinese, it is written using Cyrillic instead of Chinese characters.

[[Dungan language]]

CATEGORIES: Languages of China, Languages of Russia, Languages of Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan

The Dungan language is the native language of the Dungan people, a ethnic group living in regions of the former Soviet Union and Xinjiang who are descendants of Hui people. The Dungan call their own language the Hui language. It is a daughter language of Mandarin Chinese based on Gansu and Shaanxi dialects, and speakers of both dialects can largely understand each other. This is called mutual intelligibilty. Like Chinese, it is both tonal and analytic. However, differences between Dungan and Chinese are that Dungan is written in Cyrillic instead of Chinese characters and there are differences in vocabulary. Dungan has more Arabic and Persian loanwords and several terms are no longer used in Standard Chinese.

[[Analytic language]]

CATEGORIES: Linguistics

An analytic language is a language that organizes words and grammar by a strict word order instead of inflections, or word endings that show grammar. Examples of analytic languages include Chinese, English, Vietnamese, Thai, Khmer, and Lao. 

In Chinese, sentences are mostly in the SVO (subject-verb-object) word order. So the sentence must be "I  eat noodles", not "I noodles eat" or "eat I noodles". In Chinese this is written as 我吃面条. The verb 吃 (pronounced chī, meaning: "eat") does not change based on the subject "I" or the object "noodles", and likewise the subject 我 (pronounced wǒ, meaning: "I") and object 面条 (pronounced miàntiáo, meaning: "noodle/noodles") do not have any special word endings based on its role or number. What is important is that all the words are in the correct order. 

Modern English does have some inflections based on the subject (the verb "eat" becomes "eats" when the subject is a third person "he/she/it") and number ("noodle" is singular while "noodles" is plural), but aside from that, there are almost none. Therefore, Modern English is mostly an analytic language. Modern English has far fewer inflections that almost all other Indo-European languages, such as Spanish, German, and Russian.  

Old English was an inflectional language and content words could have several different word endings, much like German today. However, England was taken over by speakers of other languages, especially French, Danish, and Latin, and since the new rulers became second language speakers of English, the grammar simplified to what it is today.

[[Sprachbund]]

CATEGORIES: Linguistics

A sprachbund is a group of languages spoken in the same area. They become similar because the speakers live close to each other. They constantly communicate with each other. Because similarities in the languages develop, they  sometimes seem to be in the same language family.

For example, in India, where there are hundreds or thousands of languages and dialects spoken, the languages often adopt similar grammar structures, vocabulary, and sounds. Indians often communicate with people who have a different first language from themselves.

In East Asia, since China introduced writing to nearby countries, especially Japan, Korea, and Vietnam. This area is called the sinosphere, or the Chinese sphere of influence. Not only did speakers of East Asian languages learn to by write using Chinese characters, but they also borrowed many loanwords from Chinese as well.

Linguists used to believe that languages like Japanese, Korean, Mongolian, Turkish, and Finnish were part of the Altaic language family. This was because of similar features like SVO (subject-verb-object) word order and agglutinating grammar. However, most linguists no longer believe that the Altaic language family ever existed. The languages became more similar over time, whereas most related languages become more different over time. It is possible that these languages are part of a sprachbund.

[[East Asian cultural sphere]]

CATEGORIES: East Asia, Chinese culture, Japanese culture, Korean culture, Filipino culture, Vietnamese culture, Singapore, Cultural geography

The East Asian cultural sphere, Sinosphere, or Chinese sphere of influence, is a region in Asia that has many influences from Chinese culture. These including the use of Chinese characters, clothing, art, food, inventions, social structures, government structures, religious ideas, and many other influences. The area is made of the Greater China region (mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan), Japan, Korea, Singapore, and sometimes Mongolia and Vietnam (depending on who you ask). Since China had a very large trade network, it was able to easily share its goods and ideas across Eurasia, and especially its neighboring countries in East Asia.

At one point, all the countries wrote only using Chinese characters, but nowadays, only Chinese and Japanese speakers write using Chinese characters in everyday life. All the other countries either created a new writing system (Korea and Mongolia), or replaced Chinese characters with a different, already existing writing system (Mongolia, again, and Vietnam). Nonetheless, the languages of each country still have many Chinese loanwords.

[[Greater China]]

CATEGORIES: Geography of China

Greater China is the name of all the regions that both the People's Republic of China (PRC) and the Republic of China (ROC) claim (though may not not completely control). This includes mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan. The PRC controls mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau, while the ROC controls Taiwan. Each of these regions have their own passport, currency, travel rules, labor laws, and constitutions. General Secretary Xi Jinping added Xi Jinping Thought into the Communist Party's constitution during the Communist Party of China's 19th Congress (the 19th time it held elections), and one part of it says that all of China must reunite as one country.

[[Chinese loanwords]]

CATEGORIES: Chinese language, Words

Chinese loanwords are loanwords borrowed into non-Chinese languages, especially East Asian languages. Since China introduced writing to the Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese languages, each language had also borrowed many Chinese loanwords. Since all the languages have very different sound systems from each other, they all have different systems for pronouncing Chinese loanwords (though there are many words that sound similar to each other). These are called Sino-Xenic pronunciations. These are similar to how loanwords from Latin and French sound differently when spoken in English. 

At one point, all these languages only wrote in Chinese characters. Today, Japanese is the only non-Chinese language that writes in Chinese characters in everyday life. Chinese characters, or kanji in Japanese, can be used to write both native Japanese words and Chinese loanwords. Today, Korean uses Chinese characters, or hanja in Korean, only for Chinese loanwords  (when writing only in hangul is too ambiguous) and writing out one's own name. Today, Vietnamese does not use Chinese characters at all, but only uses the Latin alphabet, or chữ Quốc ngữ in Vietnamese. Chinese characters are only used as a decoration in Vietnam today, and they are studied by only a few Vietnamese.

A repository can be stored on a person's computer locally (not on the internet), but it can also be stored remotely (on a network or the internet). One of the most popular websites for hosting repositories is GitHub, however others such as GitLab exist. If a person wants to use a public repository on these kinds of websites, they can "clone" the repository onto their computer. This creates a copy of the repository, and all of the files (usually computer code) related to it. A person can then make changes to the repository, and they can "commit" those changes to their local repository (which means that their changes are recorded in the repository's history). If they wish to update the remote repository (the one stored online) they can "push" their changes to it. This updates the repository on the website or network location.

CATEGORIES: Exclaves, Canton of Schaffhausen, Geography of Baden-Württemberg

Verenahof was until 1967 a tiny part of West Germany containing three houses and twenty-four residents, completely surrounded by land belonging to Switzerland. The West German territory was an enclave separated from the rest of the country by a strip of Swiss land about 200 to 300 metres wide. 

In 1522, Emperor Charles V and his brother Archduke Ferdinand of Austria bought Verenahof at the same time when they bought other small pieces of land in the same region (Tengen, Kommingen, Wiechs am Randen) from Count Christoph von Nellenburg.

In the 17th and 18th centuries there were arguments between Tengen and Schaffhausen about access roads and the exact border of the enclave.

In 1964 West Germany and Switzerland agreed that Verenahof would become part of Switzerland. This happened on 4 October 1967. Today Verenahof is part of the village of Büttenhardt.

At the Wiechs am Randen town hall there are some remaining border markers that became no longer needed with the land swap in 1967. In Büttenhardt, at the old school house, some old border markers from the 1930s have been used to frame bushes planted around the enclave.

[[Hyponymy and hypernymy]]

CATEGORIES: Hierarchy

In linguistics, a hyponym is a word that can be changed with a different and less precise word without changing the overall meaning of the phrase. The different word is its hyperonym, hypernym or superordinate term. Hyponymy is a relation to a more generic word. A hyponym can be part of a group of words on a similar level that can all be replaced by the same hypernym. For example, pigeon, crow, eagle and seagull are all hyponyms (co-hyponyms) of bird (their hypernym). In turn, bird is a hyponym of animal. In a sentence such as 'The pigeon is flying over the church.', it is possible to change the word pigeon to bird or animal without changing the overall meaning of the sentence. This is because pigeon is a hyponym of both bird and animal. 

A hypernym is sometimes also called an umbrella term or a blanket term. 

The word Hyponym comes from the Greek hupó, "under" and ónoma, "name". Hypernym comes from the Greek hupér, "over" and ónoma, "name". A hyponym can also sometimes be a phrase. A word can be both a hypernym and a hyponym.

[[Bunia]]

CATEGORIES: Cities in Africa, Settlements in the Democratic Republic of the Congo

Bunia is a city in the Ituri Province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and the capital of Ituri province. It was part of the Orientale Province until that province was split up into smaller provinces in 2015. As of 2012 it had an estimated population of 366,126.

It lies at an elevation of 1275 m on a plateau about 30 km west of Lake Albert in the Albertine Rift, and about 25 km east of the Ituri Forest.

The city is at the center of the Ituri conflict between the Lendu and Hema. In the Second Congo War the city and district were the scene of much fighting and many civilian deaths from this conflict, and related clashes between militias and Uganda-based forces. Consequently, the city is the base of one of the largest United Nations peace-keeping forces in Africa, and its headquarters in northeastern DRC. The area's natural resources include gold mines over which militias and foreign forces have been fighting.

[[Retroactive continuity]]

CATEGORIES: Fiction

Retroactive continuity, or retcon, is when some detail in a fictional story, such as a movie, TV, or book series, is added, changed, or ignored in a later part of the series. It can happen for several different reasons, like fixing a plot hole or getting rid of a detail that was disliked by many people. 

There are a few main types of retcons. 

The first is addition. This is a new detail added to give the reader or viewer a new understanding of the story. This detail would not have been planned when a series was first being made. For example, many people who watched Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope complained that the Death Star had an easily spotted and poorly placed weak point. This made it easier to be destroyed. George Lucas, the writer of Star Wars, did not have an explanation why. However, the writers of its prequel, Rogue One, later explained this. They wrote the story so that character Galen Erso, who is the main character Jyn Erso's father, made its weak point easily seen and poorly placed on purpose. He did this so he could help the Rebel Alliance destroy it. 

The second is alteration. This is a detail goes against details already given. This is called a contradiction. For example, in Metal Gear Solid 2, the villain Revolver Ocelot tells the main character Solid Snake that Big Boss was in his late fifties when he gave his genes to make clones. This was the year 1972. However, in the prequel Metal Gear Solid 3, Big Boss is the main character. The game is set in 1964, but Big Boss is nowhere even close to being in his late forties or early fifties, which is how old he is supposed to be. 

The third is subtraction. This is a detail that gets ignored or forgotten later in a series. For example, in the movie X-Men Origins: Wolverine, the villain Colonel Stryker experiments on the superhero Deadpool and turns him into Weapon 11. This made fans of Deadpool so unhappy that when the Deadpool movie came out it completely ignored the story given in X-Men Origins.

[[Equivalent weight]]

CATEGORIES: Physical chemistry

Equivalent weight in chemistry is also known as gram equivalent. It is the mass of a given substance which will combine with or displace a fixed quantity of another substance.

The equivalent weight of an element is the mass which combines with or displaces 1.008 gram of hydrogen or 8.0 grams of oxygen or 35.5 grams of chlorine. These values are the atomic weight divided by the usual valence. For oxygen, as an example, that is 16.0g / 2.

Equivalent weight has the dimensions and units of mass, unlike atomic weight, which is dimensionless. The equivalent weight of a compound can be got by dividing the molecular weight by the number of positive or negative electrical charges carried by its ions (which result from dissolving the compound).

[[Capoid]]

CATEGORIES: Anthropology, Race

Capoid race was a word for the Khoikhoi and San peoples. American anthropologist Carleton S. Coon invented the word in 1962. The words means "looking like a person from the Cape of Good Hope". Coon divided human beings into five races. He called these races Capoid, Congoid, Mongoloid, Australoid, and Caucasoid. Today, scientists agree that there is only one human race. Modern genetic research has shown that the idea of five races was wrong.360

He starts off as a soldier for the CIA special forces team, the FOX Unit. He later creates and leads a special forces team himself, FOXHOUND.

In Metal Gear Solid 3, Big Boss unsuccessfully rescues the scientist Sokolov, because his mentor, the Boss, changes sides from the United States to Soviet Union. At first, he did not understand why. Later, it is explained that the government ordered her to change sides, because she was the only soldier Volgin would respect and trust enough to keep the Philosphers' legacy during World War II. The Boss later reunites with her former team of fellow soldiers, the Cobra Unit. She knew Big Boss, who was called Naked Snake in the game, would have to kill her as part of his mission, but she wanted to pass on her goal for him to complete. After he discovers the real reason for the Boss's death, he loses his patriotism and wants to unite the world under one government. This is so that the world's governments would not threaten to destroy each other with nuclear weapons. The government gives him a new code name, Big Boss. He dislikes the code name, because it reminded him that it was given to him for killing the Boss. She was one of the only he really cared for.

In Metal Gear 1 & 2, Big Boss attempts to use Metal Gear to destroy the world's governments, but FOXHOUND agent Solid Snake (who is also one of Big Boss's clones) destroys it and stops him.

[[Contradiction]]

CATEGORIES: Words, Philosophical concepts

A story that shows what a contradiction is comes from China. In this story, there is a merchant who sells both spears and shields. He says that his spears are so sharp that they could break through any shield. At the same time, he says that his shields are so strong that they could block any spear. This is a contradiction, because these two statements cannot both be true. Either spear will break the shield or the shield will block the spear, but not both. For this reason, the word for contradiction in Chinese is máodùn (矛盾), which literally means "spear and shield".

In Aristotle's logic, it is said that two contradictory propositions cannot both be true. For example, the propositions "A is B" and "A is not B" are mutually exclusive, meaning that only one, and not both, can be true. For example, the statements "the Pope is Catholic" and "the Pope is not Catholic" cannot both be true. Only one of the statements, and not the other, is true. 

[[Rebel Alliance]]

CATEGORIES: Star Wars

The Rebel Alliance (or The Alliance to Restore the Republic) was a group of people and aliens in the Star Wars series that fought the Galactic Empire and brought back freedom and democracy to the Star Wars galaxy. Important characters in the Rebel Alliance were Princess Leia, Bail Organa, Mon Mothma, Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Chewbacca, R2-D2, and C-3PO, as well as Jyn Erso, Kanan Jarrus, and Admiral Ackbar. 

After the Republic turned into the Empire, small cells of rebels loosely fought the Empire, led by Bail Organa. These cells later joined together into a larger Rebellion, stealing the plans of the Death Star and destroying it. Later, the Rebels fought again and destroyed the second Death Star, ending the Empire and restoring the Republic. Many of the Rebels would later join the Resistance against the First Order.

[[Galactic Empire]]

CATEGORIES: Star Wars

CURRENTMONTHNAME CURRENTYEAR

Absolute monarchyunder an military dictatorship(de facto; post-Civil War)

The Galactic Empire is the government that rules the Star Wars galaxy in the Star Wars series. They are the main villains in the first three Star Wars movies. It is ruled by Darth Sidious and enforced by his apprentice, Darth Vader. The Empire rules the galaxy by creating fear and using violence. It is a totalitarian government, which means it controls every part of the people's lives. It uses its military to kill or silence anyone who does not agree with its rule.

The Empire was created because Darth Sidious overthrew the Galactic Republic by starting the Clone Wars. Before the war started, many planets and star systems left the Republic to create their own government and army, the Separatists. Many people in the Republic were scared of the Separatists, so they voted to give emergency powers to Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, the public identity of Darth Sidious. This was because he was well-liked and they believed he was a strong leader. By the end of he war, Sidious could create any law he wanted. The only ones who could stop him were the Jedi, a very old group of knights who swore to protect the Republic. They tried to arrest him, but they failed. Sidious used this as an excuse to create a government with much more security. He made the Republic into the Empire, and made himself Emperor.

The Empire killed many people and aliens. Paying its large military made the galaxy poor. It took away almost all freedoms and rights people had under the Republic. It had a lot of corruption. Life was so terrible under the Empire that some of its governors and officials tried to talk to the Empire's leaders, but they were threatened. 

Therefore, many people and aliens joined the Rebel Alliance to destroy the Empire and bring back the Republic.

After the deaths of both Darth Vader and the Emperor and the Empire's loss on the Battle of Jakku, the Empire surrendered to the Rebel Alliance. The Rebels then created the New Republic. The Empire may have surrendered, but some of the Empire's leaders who were still alive created a new military based on the Empire, the First Order. They rebuilt by buying weapons and spaceships from greedy merchants in the Outer Rim and taking over planets with many resources they could use to buy more weapons. They also kidnapped many babies and forced them to become stormtroopers. They secretly built a superweapon called Starkiller Base. They used the weapon to blow up the capital of the New Republic, Hosnian Prime.

Now that the New Republic is gone, the First Order wants to create the Empire again.

Publius Servilius Casca Longus (84 BC – c. 42 BC) was one of the assassins of Gaius Julius Caesar. He and several other senators conspired to kill Caesar, which they did on 15 March 44 BC. He was one of the first to attack, and stabbed Caesar in the neck. 

At the time of the conspiracy, he held office in the Tribune of the People. After Caesar was dead, he ran from Rome. Casca joined Marcus Junius Brutus and Gaius Cassius Longinus, the leaders of the assassins, during the Liberators' civil war against the Second Triumvirate, Caesar's former supporters. He committed suicide during this war. 

Casca is remembered on a coin along with Brutus, where they both have their names engraved in the metal. A bearded figure appears on the coin next to Casca's name, though this is widely considered to be the Roman god Neptune.

[[Galactic Republic]]

The Galactic Republic was the government of the Star Wars galaxy in the Star Wars series until the Galactic Empire replaced it. It was made up of many planets, but all the planets had the same currency and official language. All the planets had to follow certain laws and economic rules. An example of this is that slavery is outlawed in all Republic planets. The government is a federal republic. Its leader is the Supreme Chancellor, who is chosen by voting. Each planet also chooses their Senators and Representatives to vote on and pass laws. There is also a Supreme Court. 

The Republic is protected by the Jedi Order. The Jedi are a group of knights who protect democracy and civilization so that peace can exist in the galaxy. 

The last Supreme Chancellor was Sheev Palpatine. He would later become the emperor of the Galactic Empire. In Star Wars Episode I, the first movie in the Star Wars timeline, the Republic had become very corrupt and complicated. The Galactic Senate thought Chancellor Valorum had been a poor leader, so they voted to fire him. Only a short time after he was fired, they voted for Palpatine to replace him.  

Many member planets did not like what the Republic had become, so they left the Republic and created a new government, the Separatists. Count Dooku was the leader of the Separatists, but it was really created by Palpatine himself, and Dooku was his apprentice. Palpatine did this because he was trying to start a war. His plan was to use the war to weaken the Republic and destroy the Jedi so that he could create the Empire. His apprentice Dooku also created an army of clones so that the Republic would have an army to fight the war. Palpatine should have stopped being Chancellor long ago, but he stayed being Chancellor because the Senate voted that he can have emergency powers. That meant that he could pass any law he wanted to because the Republic was fighting a war against the Separatists. 

Near the end of the war, Palpatine told the young Jedi Anakin Skywalker that he was a Sith Lord, someone who uses the dark side of the Force. When Anakin told the Jedi Council that Palpatine was a Sith, Mace Windu and three other Jedi Masters went to Palpatine's office to arrest or kill him. They failed because Palpatine tricked Anakin in helping kill Mace Windu. He used this attempt as an excuse to give Order 66 to the clone army. This order was given to clone troopers to kill any Jedi they see. Palpatine also ordered Anakin, now Darth Vader, to bring clone troopers to destroy the Jedi Temple and kill all the Jedi there, even the children. Most Jedi were killed only a short time after the order was given. 

He then tricked the Senate into thinking that the Jedi wanted to destroy the Republic, so he created the Empire to make everyone think they would be safer. After the Empire was created, the military became much bigger and most freedoms were taken away. In Star Wars Episode IV, Emperor Palpatine got rid of the Senate, which was the only thing from the Republic that still existed. He hoped that after this, memories of the Republic would disappear. 

However, people who still believed in the Republic created the Rebel Alliance and fought a war against the Empire. After the deaths of both Emperor Palpatine and Darth Vader and the Battle of Jakku, the Empire surrendered to the Rebel Alliance. This ended the war and the New Republic was created, but the New Republic was destroyed only a few decades later. This was because the First Order, the military that was created from what was left of the Empire, created a superweapon called Starkiller Base. They used the weapon to blow up the capital of the New Republic, Hosnian Prime.

[[Speculation tax]]

CATEGORIES: British Columbia, Taxation in Canada, Politics of Canada, Houses, Law, Legislation

The Speculation and vacancy tax is a provincial property tax levied in the Province of British Columbia starting in 2019. It is an opt-out tax paid when the property is vacant. It is paid in addition to the regular property tax. The rate for this tax is a half per cent of a home's assessed value for owners who are residents of British Columbia (BC), one per cent for Canadians from other provinces and two percent for owners from other countries. Homes that are not exempt from this tax, pay it in addition to their regular property tax. This tax is not to be confused with Vancouver's empty homes tax, which is also being levied on empty homes located in the city of Vancouver.

All owners of homes in British Columbia are invited to fill out applications for exemption from this tax every year. If a home is owned by more than one person, for example a couple, all owners must complete a separate application for exemption. A part-owner who does not file for an exemption must pay the tax based on their proportional part of the assessed value even if the home is occupied.  Tens of thousands of homeowners have not filed for exemption by March 30, 2019. 

The BC Goverment says the tax is a "key measure in tackling the housing crisis in major urban centres in British Columbia". It says that  it took this action because the people who live and people who work in BC deserve to have affordable housing. According to the goverment, the tax is a part of it's 30-Point Plan to make housing more affordable. The tax is Targeted at speculators who own homes in BC but do not pay taxes. It changes  empty homes into occupied  housing. It also creates revenue which will pay for affordable housing.  

This  tax is levied on empty homes in most urban centers:

Within these areas, any reserve lands, treaty lands, or self-government First Nations are exempt.

The rate of the tax for all Canadians has been lowered to one half of a percent. This happened after negotiating between the NDP Party and the Green Party.

[[Chinatown]]

CATEGORIES: Chinese culture

Chinatown is the name used for neighborhood in any city outside of China where many Chinese immigrants came to live together. Chinatowns became common in cities around the world after China lost the first Opium War with the British Empire. After China lost, many Chinese people became poor, especially people living in Guangdong province. That was where most of the fighting took place. People from Guangdong went outside of China to look for work. They moved to places like Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, and the United States. When Chinese people moved to these places, they usually lived close together in the city they were staying. These became Chinatowns.

Famous Chinatowns around the world include those in San Francisco, New York City, and Kuala Lumpur.

Most early immigrants came from provinces of Guangdong and Fujian in southeastern China. The common languages there are Toishanese, Cantonese, Hakka, Teochew, and Hokkien. So, these are common languages in many Chinatowns. Also, since most Chinatowns were created before the Chinese Communist Party took over mainland China, most Chinatowns use traditional Chinese characters. However, both simplified and traditional characters are often seen in Chinatowns in Malaysia.

CATEGORIES: Polymers, Biochemistry, Materials

Cellophane is a bioplastic wrapping material. It is a thin, transparent sheet made of cellulose. It has low permeability. That means very little air, oils, greases, bacteria, and water can get in. That makes it useful for food packaging.

Cellophane was invented by Swiss chemist Jacques E. Brandenberger. 

It took ten years for Brandenberger to perfect his idea. He added glycerin to soften the material. By 1912 he had built a machine to make the film. He called the product "Cellophane", from the words cellulose and diaphane ("transparent"). Cellophane was patented that year.right|thumb|250px|Cellulose is treated with alkali and carbon disulfide to yield viscose

DuPont built the first cellophane manufacturing plant in the US. One of their chemists found a way to make it moisture proof. The material became hugely popular.

"Cellophane" is a general term in some countries, but in other countries it is a registered trademark.

Cellophane played a crucial role in developing the self-service retailing of fresh meat. The transparency helped customers see the quality of meat before buying. Cellophane also largely prevents discoloration of food.

[[Yoke and arrows]]

CATEGORIES: Politics of Spain, Symbols, Spain

The Yoke and the Bundle of Arrows or the Yoke and Arrows (el Yugo y el haz de flechas or el yugo y las flechas) is a badge from the times of the Spanish monarchy of Ferdinand II and Isabella. It represents the unity of the Spanish monarchy and state, and it also promotes the "heroic virtues of the Spanish race". The Y in yugo stands for Ysabel, as in another spelling of Queen Isabella; and the F in flechas stands for the first letter in King Fernando's name.

The yoke also takes inspiration from the legend of the Gordian knot, as well as the motto that comes with it, Tanto monta. The arrows being wrapped together refers to the moral story that claims that, like people, arrows can be easily broken one by one, but less so when they are together.

In the late 1800s, the yoke and arrows became the political symbol of the Spanish socialist party. After more socialist parties were created and decided to use different icons, the fascist Falangist party began to use the yoke and arrows.

[[Flatback turtle]]

CATEGORIES: Turtles

The flatback turtle or sea turtle (Natator depressus) is an Australian species of  turtle in the family Cheloniidae. The species is endemic to the sandy beaches and shallow coastal waters of the Australian continental shelf. It was previously called Chelonia depressa. 

The turtle gets its common name from  the fact that its shell has a flattened or lower dome than the other turtles. It may be olive green to grey with a cream underside. It averages from 76 to 96 cm (30 to 38 inches) in carapace length and can weigh from 70 to 90 kg (154 to 198 lb).  

The hatchlings, when emerging from nests, are larger than other turtle hatchlings. The flatback turtle is listed by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species as Data Deficient, meaning there is insufficient scientific information to decide its conservation status at present. 

The flatback turtle is the least endangered of all of the sea-going turtles. Unlike other  turtles, there is not a big human demand for the meat of the flatback. It does not swim far from shore, so it does not get caught in nets as often as other sea turtles. These reasons may be why it is not in more danger of extinction.

[[Dialect continuum]]

CATEGORIES: Language

[[Chelidae]]

CATEGORIES: Turtles

The Chelidae are a family of freshwater turtles. They are side-necked turtles. The family is distributed in Australia, New Guinea, parts of Indonesia, and throughout most of South America. It is a large family of turtles, and its fossil history goes back to the Cretaceous. 

The family Chelidae has about 60 living species in about twenty genera. The family is entirely Gondwanan in origin, with no members found outside Gondwana, either now or as a fossil.

They are called side-necked turtles because they withdraw their heads by moving the head sideways (see Pleurodira). Other turtles, if they withdraw their heads, pull them back in the vertical plane. 

The subfamilies within Chelidae show that most of the South American species and all the Australian species are a clade, that is, evolved from the same ancestor (monophyly.  The far more ancient turtle genus Hydromedusa is their sister taxon.

Nowadays, all these species live in fresh water, but we know from the fossil record that many of their forebears lived in seas around the world.

CATEGORIES: Taxation in Canada, Income

Every Canadian with income must file an income tax return every year. People earning a small amount are exempt from this requirement. Unlike Americans, Canadian citizens who live outside Canada are exempt from filing an income tax return and paying taxes to Canada, unless their income is derived in Canada.

The income tax returns are assessed by Canada Revenue Agency (CRA). Sometimes the filer must pay and other times they get a refund. Most employees pay income tax in advance through employer deductions. This is called tax withholding. When tax witholding exceeds the income tax due for the year, the employee can get a refund when filing their tax return.

Income tax in Canada is very complex. The Income Tax Act contains over over one million words

The deadline for filing an income tax return is April 30th of the following year.  Those who owe money to the government and miss the deadline pay interest on the amount owed plus a penalty.

2018 Lombok earthquake may refer to the following five thrust type earthquakes. They occurred in July and August, with epicentres north of Rinjani volcano, that caused significant damage and deaths:

On August 5, 2018, Lombok Island, an island off the eastern part of Bali Island, Indonesia experienced a 6.9 magnitude earthquake. The epicenter of the earthquake was 18 km Northwest of East Lombok. The earthquake had the potential to cause a tsunami, and a Tsunami alert was sounded but later the warming was removed as the risk was reduced. The Indonesian government made efforts to broadcast information about the impact of the earthquake. However, thorough geospatial data about how the earthquake affects larger areas was limited and mostly inaccessible for the public. Available information, for example, was that according to the Head of the Regional Disaster Management Agency (BPBD) of West Nusa Tenggara Province, the loss due to the earthquake reached 1 trillion IDR. Then, according to the National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB), the number of victims of the earthquake was >100 people, with 238 people injured, thousands of homes damaged, and tens of thousands becoming refugees.

A tsunami struck Java and Sumatra starting at 9:30 p.m. and resulting in more than 300 deaths. The tsunami was likely caused by undersea landslides due to the ongoing eruption of Anak Krakatau volcano located in the Sunda Strait. Anak Krakatau’s most recent series of eruptions started in June 2018.

[[Affordable housing]]

CATEGORIES: Houses

Affordable housing is places to live that the average person can afford to purchase or rent. The cost of housing can refer either to rental housing or to homes which are owned by the occupants.  People with lower income can live there. 

Comparing the price of housing to income tells if housing is affordable. As the price of housing becomes a larger, affordability goes down if income is the same. Housing market sets the price for places to live. 

The global financial crisis in 2008 caused huge changes and many problems in the world banking and housing systems. By 2011 home prices in Ireland dropped by about 45%. In the United States, prices fell by 34%, and foreclosures went up.

According to USA Today, homes in 2019 in the United States were  least affordable to purchase compared to any other year in the last  ten last years. This is because home prices are increasing much faster than wages. Cities with large universities were a good choice for university students after they graduate. For example, the University of Wisconsin-Madison in Madison, Wisconsin has very affordable housing.

According to Bloomberg News, Berlin has decided to freeze rents in the city because there was not enough affordable housing.

The Fox and the Hound is a 1981 American animated drama movie. It was produced by Walt Disney Productions. It is loosely based on the 1967 book with the same name by Daniel P. Mannix. It is the 24th Disney animated movie. The movie tells the story of the unlikely friendship between a red fox named Tod and a hound dog named Copper. The two friends have trouble keeping their friendship despite their emerging instincts, as well as the people around them saying that they have to be enemies. The movie was directed by Ted Berman, Richard Rich, and Art Stevens. It was produced by Ron Miller, Wolfgang Reitherman, and Art Stevens. The movie has the voices of Mickey Rooney, Kurt Russell, Pearl Bailey, Jack Albertson, Sandy Duncan, Jeanette Nolan, Pat Buttram, John Fiedler, John McIntire, Dick Bakalyan, Paul Winchell, Keith Mitchell, and Corey Feldman.

Walt Disney Productions first bought the rights to make a movie based on the novel by Daniel P. Mannix in 1967. However, the making of the movie did not actually happen until spring 1977. The Fox and the Hound was the last movie to involve the remaining members of Disney's Nine Old Men. Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston were two of them. In the end, the movie was handed over to a new generation of animators after the retirement of the old animators. However, the old animators had involvement in the early making of the movie. Also, The Fox and the Hound was the first movie for future directors including Tim Burton, Brad Bird, and John Lasseter. During the making of the movie, the movie's release was delayed by over six months. This was because of the sudden and unexpected retirement of Don Bluth and his team of animators. In the part of the movie where the character Chief is hit by a train, the movie makers were originally going to have him die like in the book. This was changed so that Chief survives with a broken leg. This decision was controversial with the movie makers.

The Fox and the Hound was released to movie theaters on July 10, 1981 by Buena Vista Distribution. The movie was a success at the box office. It was the 14th highest-grossing movie of the year and made $39.9 million in the United States. At the time of release, it was the most expensive animated movie produced to date. It cost $12 million to make the movie. It was re-released to theaters on March 25, 1988. An intermediate follow-up, The Fox and the Hound 2, was released directly-to-DVD on December 12, 2006.

The epidermis in plants is a single layer of cells. It covers the leaves, flowers, roots and stems of plants. It divides the plant from the outside environment. The epidermis has more than one function. It protects the plant from loss of water. It controls gas exchange. It makes metabolic compounds. In the roots it  takes in water and nutrients. Some parts of a plant may have a different cover called a periderm. Potatoes have that kind of covering.

The epidermis is the outer cell layer of a plant. It is also the main part of the dermal tissue of leaves, stems, roots, flowers, fruits, and seeds. It is usually transparent.

The cells of the epidermis can vary in the way they are made and how they work. Most plants have an epidermis that is a single cell layer thick. Some plants, however, have an epidermis with more than one layer. Epidermal cells are linked tightly to each other. They give strength and protection to the plant. In the parts of the plant that are above ground, the epidermal cells contain cutin and are covered with a cuticle.  This cuticle reduces loss of water. It is sometimes covered with wax. The wax gives some plants a whitish or bluish surface color. It also protects the plant from sunlight and wind. 

The epidermis has more than one cell type. It can include epidermal cells, guard cells, subsidiary cells, and epidermal hairs (Trichomes). There are more epidermal cells than the other types.

Trichomes (or hairs) grow out from the epidermis in many plants.

[[Mueller Report]]

CATEGORIES: Controversies in the United States

The Mueller Report is an official document. It provides information about Russia modifying the results of the 2016 United States presidential election. Robert Mueller released this official document to argue that Donald Trump is using Russia to help get him to become the current president.

The first half of the report shows that the Trump campaign had many ties to the Russians and that there was interference in America’s elections. The second half shows how the President tried to stop the Russia investigation using the powers of the President.

Because the Department of Justice works for the President, Robert Mueller suggests that Congress should investigate.

““In this context, a balancing test applies to the separation of powers issues. Applying the test here, we concluded that congress can validly make obstruction of justice statutes applicable to corruptly motivated official acts of the president without undermining his Article II functions”

[[Four-field approach]]

CATEGORIES: Anthropology, Academic disciplines

The four types of anthropology included are archaeology, linguistics, physical anthropology, and cultural anthropology.  Together, these four types of anthropology explain how different humans are all over the world and throughout history.

There are some people who think applied anthropology, which uses the information learned from studying anthropology to solve modern problems of health or education, it's own subject, which would make it a "five field approach", but this is not as common.

Most students who study anthropology learn about all four big kinds of anthropology but later focus on only two of the subjects.

[[Homosexuality and religion]]

CATEGORIES: Religions, LGBT

The relationship between homosexuality and religion has changed a lot across place and time, and within and between different religions. There have also been changes in different forms of homosexuality and bisexuality. Present-day doctrines of the world's major religions are vastly different.

Several religions (particularly the Abrahamic ones) do not allow homosexuality and/or same-sex marriage. In other words, some religions will only allow sex within marriage between one man and one woman. For example, in Judaism, the rules teach that man shall not lie with another man as he would with a woman. Most forms of Christianity take a conservative approach on the issue of homosexuality, same-sex marriage and LGBT rights: including the Eastern Orthodox Church, Mormonism , Oriental Orthodoxy, the Roman Catholic Church and many strains of Protestantism (including Evangelicalism, Pentecostalism, Presbyterianism among others)-calling same-sex acts as sinful. 

However, there are liberal forms of Christianity accept homosexuality, LGBT rights and same-sex marriage. Namely, the United Church of Christ, the Evangelical Lutheran Church, the Metropolitan Community Church and several others are accepting of homosexuality and LGBT rights.

Some religous fundamentalists have said that HIV/AIDS is a punishment from God against homosexual people.

Conservative denominations often oppose same-sex sexual relations based on Old and New Testament that call human sexual relations as strictly heterosexual (in other words, between one man and one woman).

[[20 July Plot]]

CATEGORIES: World War II

On 20 July 1944, Claus von Stauffenberg and other conspirators tried to assassinate Adolf Hitler, Führer of Nazi Germany, inside his Wolf's Lair field headquarters near Rastenburg, East Prussia. The name Operation Valkyrie—originally referring to part of the conspiracy—has become related to the plot. The idea behind the assassination was to seize political control of Germany and its armed forces from the Nazi Party (including the SS) and to make peace with the Western Allies as soon as possible.

The plot was a plan by several groups in the German resistance to overthrow the Nazi German government. Claus von Stauffenberg planted a bomb close to Adolf Hitler since he was presented with him in the conference meeting. The bomb failed to kill Hitler since one of the participants unwittingly moved the bomb away from Hitler. The table absorbed much of the blast as a result. The failure of the assassination attempt and the intended military coup d'état that was to follow led the Gestapo to arrest more than 7,000 people, of whom they executed 4,980.

CATEGORIES: Oasis (band) songs

"Songbird" is a song by English rock band Oasis, from their fifth studio album Heathen Chemistry, and is the first single by Oasis written by vocalist Liam Gallagher.

Liam has said of the song: "I like beautiful things . . . It's not all dark in Liam World. I take me shades off every now and again and have a look at the world and see some nice things." Noel Gallagher stated jokingly in an interview with Patrick Kielty that Liam decided to "write a song about his bird", and states the title "Song . . . bird" in a cave man like manner. The song was written as a tribute to then-fiancée Nicole Appleton. "Songbird" was composed in the key of G major using common time at 132 beats per minute.

“Songbird blew my head off when I first heard it because it was that f--king simple and that direct. But when Liam plays you a song he wants you to instantly f--king drop dead on the spot and then, when you come around, stab yourself in the heart and be in awe of the f--king sonic ability of the man.”

The song was released as the fourth single from the band's Heathen Chemistry album, on 3 February 2003 and peaked at number 3 in the UK charts. It is included on the band's compilation album Stop the Clocks. Being written by lead singer Liam Gallagher, it was the first time the band had released a single not written by his brother Noel. "(You've Got) The Heart of the Star" and "Columbia" are B-sides, the latter of which was recorded live at the Glasgow Barrowlands, in October 2001.

The demo of the song is a typical Oasis approach to the song, featuring overdriven guitar and a stronger beat, as well as a guitar solo. Courtney Love has said that she and Liam played a version with her whistling and Gallagher playing guitar and singing, this was noted in the book Kurt and Courtney: Talking. Gallagher played the song for UK Radio Aid in January 2005.

[[Tonic water]]

CATEGORIES: Soft drinks

Tonic water is a kind of soda that tastes slightly bitter. The quinine in tonic water  has a bitter flavor. Originally, it was to protect people against Malaria. The first drug against Malaria was Chloroquine, which became available in 1934. The first time tonic water became available was in the 1860s, over 70 years before the first drug. 

Tonic water is often called Indian tonic. People drank it in Africa and Southeast Asia, where Malaria was common. At the time, quinine was a powder that was mixed with water or soda water. Because quinine on its own is bitter, sweeteners were often added (usually sugar). Often, it was mixed with liquors. Gin and tonic is the most common. 

Quinine should not be used during pregnancy as it will have an influence on the unborn child. There are also other conditions where quinine (and tonic water) should not be used.

Today, tonic water contains a lot less quinine than before the drug was developed.

[[Cytoplasmic streaming]]

CATEGORIES: Cell biology, Botany, Plant physiology

Cytoplasmic streaming is where there is flow inside the cytoplasm. It is sometimes  called protoplasmic streaming or cyclosis.

Streaming is often seen in large plant and animal cells. Cytoplasm moves inside the cells. The flow is driven by forces in the cytoskeleton. The function of the flow is probably to speed up transport of molecules and organelles around the cell. Cytoplasmic streaming is usually found in  large cells, larger than about 0.1 mm. In smaller cells diffusion of molecules is rapid, but it slows  as the cell size increases. Larger cells need flow to move nutrients inside them rapidly enough for efficient working.

[[Launch vehicle]]

CATEGORIES: Spaceflight

A launch vehicle or carrier rocket is a rocket used to take a payload from Earth's surface through outer space. This can be to another place on earth (Sub-orbital transportation), or into space. Sub-orbital vehicles aren't as powerful as orbital vehicles must be. They use more than one stage so that they have enough delta-v performance. Many different rocket fuels can be used, and some rockets have solid rocket boosters attached. 

Most launch vehicles are expendable, which means that they can only be used once. This means that lots of expensive equipment is lost, but it also means that the launch vehicle can carry a heavier payload.   SpaceX has developed a reusable rocket, called the Falcon 9. The first stage of this rocket can land and be relaunched. Parts of the Space Shuttle were also reusable. There are many different types of launch vehicle. The vehicle that is used depends on the spaceport, the mass of the payload, and the orbit that the payload is being launched to. Many countries try and build their own rockets as part of their national space programs.
