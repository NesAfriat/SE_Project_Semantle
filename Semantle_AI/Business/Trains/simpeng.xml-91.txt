The Bento Reodrigues dam disaster happened on  5 November 2015, when a dam at a Germano iron ore mine broke. The disaster is also known as  Mariana dam disaster, or Samarco dam disaster. It happened in a mine near Mariana, Minas Gerais, Brazil. The flooding devastated the downstream villages of Bento Rodrigues and Paracatu de Baixo, 40 from Bento Rodrigues, killing 19 people. The damage caused by the tailings dam collapse is the largest ever recorded with pollutants spread along 668 of watercourses.

The failure of the dam released 43.7 million cubic metres of mine tailings into the Doce River. A  toxic brown mudflow polluted the river and beaches near the mouth when it reached the Atlantic Ocean 17 days later. The disaster created a humanitarian crisis as hundreds were displaced and cities along the Doce River suffered water shortages when their water supplies were polluted.

The total impact of the disaster, including the reason for failure and the environmental consequences, are officially under investigation and remain unclear. The owner of the Bento Rodrigues dam, Samarco, was subject to extensive litigation and government sanctions. In 2016, charges of manslaughter and environmental damage were filed against 21 executives, including Samarco's former CEO and representatives from Samarco's owners, Vale and BHP Billiton, on its board of directors. Controversy over the investigation grew after a 2013 report, indicating structural issues in the dam, was leaked.

[[Political corruption]]

CATEGORIES: Politics, Economic systems, Controversies

Political corruption is using powers of government officials or their network contacts for inappropriate private gain. 

The forms of corruption are very different between one another. Examples of political corruption are lobbying, bribery, extortion (which refers when to someone commits blackmail or bribery against or threatens other people through putting a feeling of fear by telling certain people something will happen if the victim does not comply), nepotism (the unfair use of power for receiving job employments or benefits by family or friends), patronage (improperly using state money/goods to reward families, certain groups or races in exchange for voting for certain political party members) and embezzlement. Corruption is often linked to human trafficking, money laundering and drug trafficking. But political corruptions are not limited to these illegal acts. Misuse of government power for certain other purposes, an example of which is police brutality is also classified as political corruption.

Political corruption hurts democracy by going against the formal process. Corruption in elections and in legislature reduces responsibility and falsely represents the related creations of policies.

Economies having a high level of political corruption tend to not be as financially successful as one that has low level corruption. Political corruption not only threatens justice and ethical values. Recalls of loans by international banks, along with massive selling of emerging market stocks from international mutual funds, is associated with (and can actually cause) crises in economics and currency problems in certain countries. Examples of these problems are in Asia, Africa and Central America.

The Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2018 is law in Pakistan which was passed by the parliament in 2018 to legally provide equality to transgender people and to make sure they kept their rights. The law aims to legally recognise transgender people in the country. It also allows them to legally have the same rights as cisgender people. The law gives trans peoples official equality, but non substantive equality and although the law has taken a large leap towards the equality of trans peoples in Pakistan, major cultural and infrastructural changes need to occur before this is genuinely the case.

In March 2020, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) addressed the provision of Pakistan after releasing a paper at International Transgender Day of Visibility. The ICJ highlighted features of the provision. Pakistan, according to the Aljazeera, is the one of the first nations that legally recognised transgender people.

[[Oswald Spengler]]

CATEGORIES: German philosophers, 1880 births, 1936 deaths

Oswald Spengler (29 May 1880-8 May 1936) was a German philosopher and schoolteacher. He was mostly active in the areas of the philosophy of history,  and cultural history. He also had antidemocratic ideas. He was part of a group of people called Konservative Revolution. His main work, The Decline of the West (original: Der Untergang des Abendlandes), he is against telling the story of humanity as a linear story of advances and successes. Instead, he says that history is cyclic: new cultures arise, they are successful, and they vanish again. He also says that the different cultures are well-defined, and clearly distinguishable. One such culture usually has a "lifetime" of about 1.000 years. Even in the title of his work, he says that the culture of the West (he used the term Abendland, occident, in English),  is in decline. 

According to his contemporaries, Spengler correctly predicted some historical developments. He also influenced a few historians, such as Franz Borkenau and Arnold J. Toynbee. 

Spengler also published a number of minor works. As he saw that the Weimar Republic didn't work, he hoped that there would be a dictator thar would be strong enough to master the political challenges, in internal and foreign policy. Spengler talked about an era of  wars of annihilation (such as the First World War). Spengler was also against National Socialism. He thought that antisemitism (as propagated by the Nazis) was too simple to be a solution for the problems of the time.  He also thought that Benito Mussolini was better at what he did than Adolf Hitler.

Spengler died of a heart attack in his apartment in Munich, on May 8, 1936. 

The Nazis were ambivalent as to Spengler: Some saw him as one of the philosophical forefathers, others though that his ideas were too antiquated to be useful. As a philosopher, Alfred Baeumler was much closer to Nazi ideologies.

[[Rta]]

CATEGORIES: Hinduism

In the Vedic religion, Ṛta (/ˈrɪtə/; Sanskrit ऋत ṛta "order, rule; truth") is the principle of natural order which regulates and coordinates the operation of the universe and everything within it. In the hymns of the Vedas, Ṛta is described as that which is ultimately responsible for the proper functioning of the natural, moral and sacrificial orders. Conceptually, it is closely allied to the injunctions and ordinances thought to uphold it, collectively referred to as Dharma, and the action of the individual in relation to those ordinances, referred to as Karma – two terms which eventually eclipsed Ṛta in importance as signifying natural, religious and moral order in later Hinduism. Sanskrit scholar Maurice Bloomfield referred to Ṛta as "one of the most important religious conceptions of the "Rigveda", going on to note that, "from the point of view of the history of religious ideas we may, in fact we must, begin the history of Hindu religion at least with the history of this conception".

[[Firefly squid]]

CATEGORIES: Cephalopods, Animals of Japan, Bioluminescent animals

The firefly squid (Watasenia scintillans), also commonly known as the sparkling enope squid or hotaru-ika in Japan, is a species of squid in the family Enoploteuthidae. It is the sole species in the monotypic genus Watasenia. These tiny squid are found on the shores of Japan in springtime during spawning season, but spend most of their life in deeper waters between 200 and 400 metres (700 and 1,300 feet; 100 and 200 fathoms). They are bioluminescent organisms and emit blue light from photophores, which some scientists have thought could be used for communication, camouflage, or attracting food, but it is still unclear in the scientific community exactly how this species uses their bioluminescence. The firefly squid is a predator and actively hunts its food, which includes copepods, small fish, and other squids. The lifespan of a firefly squid is about one year. At the end of their lives females return close to shore to release their eggs, and then die shortly thereafter. This mass migration of firefly squid to the shore is amazing business for Japanese fishermen, and during spawning season many go out to the bays to collect the dying squid. Many more also visit Japan during spawning season to see the bright blue light created from the firefly squid's bioluminescence light up the bay, making their spawning season not only a fishing opportunity but also a tourist attraction.

The team was founded in 1965 by Max Gutmann, an Augsburg entrepreneur and promoter of sports and science, and sports journalist Horst Eckert.

The Datschiburger Kickers are still active today. More than 300 games have been played since 1965 and over 1.5 million Euros have been raised for social causes.

The team's name is derived from a nickname for Augsburg citizens, the Datschiburgers. This in turn is based on the Zwetschgendatschi, a yeast cake invented in Augsburg.

In the 1960s and 1970s, the Datschiburger Kickers played in Augsburg's Rosenaustadion in front of up to 20,000 spectators. The most famous team members were athletes such as Helmut Schön, Günter Netzer, Sepp Herberger, Helmut Haller, Uwe Seeler, Franz Beckenbauer, Gerd Müller, Fritz Walter, Uli Biesinger and Max Schmeling.

[[Naophangba]]

CATEGORIES: Kings of Ancient Manipur

Meidingu Naophangba (Meitingu Naophangpa) was a Meetei ruler of Ningthouja dynasty of Ancient Manipur (Antique Kangleipak). He is the successor of Naokhamba and the predecessor of Sameiraang. He promulgated a proto-Constitution in 429 AD, which later grew into the Loyumba Shinyen, a written constitution in 1100 AD, during the reign of King Loyumba. He is one of the most outstanding figures in the history of Meitei architecture of Ancient Manipur. He laid the foundation stone of the Kangla, the "Namthak Sarongpung", which is the holiest place to the Manipuri ethnicity.

During his reign, the coronation hall in the Kangla was inaugurated and a hog was sacrificed.

According to the Loyumba Shinyen, he took command from Mangang Luwang Khuman for the administration of justice in the kingdom. According to the Chakparol, the ten villages of the Chakpas separated during his reign. It was right from his reign that the newcomers (immigrants) were assigned and admitted to the yek salai (clans) and the yumnaks (families) of the Meitei ethnicity. According to the Thengkourol, copper and brass were imported from Burma (Awaa Leipak) and China (Khaaki Leipak) during his reign. 

The first seven kings preceding his reign were sometimes considered divine, but it was right from his era that the rulers were usually regarded as human beings. He is remembered for his emphasis on ethics. Though many Manipuri Muslims claim that their earliest ancestors settled in Manipur right from the reign of Naophangba (5th century AD), the claim is clearly contradicted by the fact that Islam and Muslims first set feet in the Indian subcontinent in Gujarat, extreme Western India in 623 AD (7th century AD).

[[Shell shock]]

CATEGORIES: History of medicine, Anxiety disorders

In World War I, many soldiers had psychological problems. These kinds of problems are known as post-traumatic stress disorder (or PTSD) today. The term post-traumatic stress disorder is relatively new. At the time, people such as Charles Samuel Myers called this condition shell shock.   Shell shock is a reaction to bombardment and fighting. Soldiers who were affected often felt helpless. Very often they panicked, were scared, and tried to flee. They were also unable to reason, sleep, walk or talk.

During the War, people did not agree on what exactly shell shock was. Some people interpreted it as  a physical or psychological injury, others said it was a lack of morale. In 2021, the Department of Veterans Affairs still used the term shell shock to describe certain parts of PTSD. In most cases, the term is no longer used, except for very specific injuries which occurred during the war.

From  World War II onwards,  people were no longer diagnosed  with shell shock: The new term used was combat stress reaction:  this is a similar but not identical response to the trauma of warfare and bombardment.

[[Bavarian Alps]]

CATEGORIES: Regions of Bavaria, Mountain ranges of Germany, Mountain ranges of the Alps

The Bavarian Alps (Bayerische Alpen) are a section of the Northern Eastern Alps (Nördlichen Ostalpen) in the international unified orographic classification of the Alps (SOIUSA) according to Sergio Marazzi. The same name is used in the Partizione delle Alpi for a mountain group of the Central Alps, but there it covers a larger area. The term "Bavarian Alps" is not used in the mountain classification of the Eastern Alps developed by the German-speaking Alpine Clubs. In contrast, the large natural region of the Swabian-Bavarian Pre-Alps largely coincides with the Bavarian Alps, but does not include some parts of the landscape (see below).

In a broader sense, "Bavarian Alps" also stands for the part of the Alps located on Bavarian or German territory. Bavaria is the only German state that has a share of the Alps. Mostly, however, the Bavarian Alps are understood to mean only the mountain parts located between the rivers Lech and Saalach in Germany. With this interpretation, therefore, the Allgäu Alps, to which the Bavarian territory has only recently extended, and the Berchtesgaden Alps do not belong to the Bavarian Alps.

The Bavarian Alps are to be distinguished from the Bavarian Prealps. The latter comprise only the Bavarian part of the Pre-Alps between the Loisach in the west and the Inn in the east.

[[Abstract photography]]

CATEGORIES: Photography, Art

In most cases, photography is about taking pictures of objects or scenes that can directly be recognised. This is done as a way to document things, or to do a portrait, for example.  Abstract photography focuses on details, or on the way light is used. As a result, the object that is photographed can no longer be recognised easily. An abstract photograph often only  shows a part of a natural scene. The viewer no longer has information about the context. That way, it may create a view that looks unreal. Very often  color, light, shadow, texture, shape or form are used  to give a feeling, sensation or impression.

The image may be produced using traditional photographic equipment like a camera, darkroom or computer, or it may be created without using a camera by directly manipulating film, paper or other photographic media, including digital presentations.

Tanzeem Ittehad-I-Ummat (Urdu:تنزیم اتحاد امت) is not a political organisation, and its edicts are not legally binding.

In recent years it was impossible for transgenders to marry in Pakistan, where gay marriage remains punishable by life imprisonment, and since 2018 “third gender” is recognised on official identity cards.

Over the years, transgender rights have come a long way all over the world. For instance, protections for transgender sex workers and private escorts have come into place to ensure that trans women and men can work more safely.

The head of the religious organisation appealed to the nation in a press conference accompanied by other religious leaders at Lahore Press Club. They asked central leaders of protesting religio-political parties to keep “extremist elements” away from their sit-ins and called for a resolution of all issues through dialogue. Whereby Muhammad Zia Ul Haq Naqshbandi, a senior scholar of the Lahore-based head of the "Tanzeem Ittehad-I-Ummat" appealed to Chief Justice of Pakistan which issued a fatwa, said parents who deprived their transgender sons or daughters of inheritances were “inviting the wrath of God”.

The fatwa declared that: -  

The controversial fatwa also stated that any act intended to “humiliate, insult or tease” the community was forbidden, and that transgender persons should not be deprived of family inheritances, nor the right to be buried in Muslim ceremonies.

Whilst the fatwa has been welcomed by Pakistan’s LGBT community, it was received with widespread cross-sect opposition from the country’s many Islamic groups who perceived the ruling as a passive acceptance and encouragement of LGBT activity.

This group wields influence due to its tens of thousands of followers across Pakistan respectively.

[[Indo-Persianate architecture]]

CATEGORIES: Architectural styles, Islamic architecture, Architecture of Pakistan

The Indian subcontinent's Islamic period produced architecture that drew stylistically from Persianate culture, using features such as domes, iwans, minars, and baghs. Early Islamic rulers tended to use spolia from Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain buildings, resulting in an Indianised style which would be refined by later kingdoms. Hence monuments came to feature uniquely Indian architectural elements, such as corbelled arches and jali. The main buildings produced were mosques, forts, and tombs. These still stand today and are well-represented in the architecture of cities such as Lahore, Delhi, and Hyderabad, to name a few. 

Indo-Persian architecture was not exclusive to Islamic power, as the members and rulers of other religions incorporated it in their monuments. Sikh architecture is a notable example of this. The Hindu Vijayanagara Empire used Indo-Persian architecture in courtly monuments.

[[Metallicity]]

CATEGORIES: Astrophysics, Stars

Metallicity is a term In astronomy. It means the amount of elements that are heavier than hydrogen and helium. 

Most of the normal physical matter in the Universe is either hydrogen or helium. Astronomers use the word "metals" as a convenient short term for "all elements except hydrogen and helium". This is different from the usual chemical or physical definition of a metal as an electrically conducting solid. 

Stars and nebulae with plenty of heavier elements are called "metal-rich", even though many of those elements are non-metals in chemistry.

The heavier elements come from stellar nucleosynthesis. Most elements heavier than hydrogen and helium in the Universe ("metals") are formed in the cores of stars. Over time, stellar winds and supernovae put the metals into the surrounding environment, enriching the interstellar medium. There it is material for the birth of new stars. Older generations of stars, which formed in the metal-poor early Universe, generally have lower metallicities than those of younger generations, which formed in a more metal-rich Universe.

The court case was because biscuits are taxed differently than cakes. 

McVitie's did not register the name "Jaffa Cakes" as a trademark. For this reason, other  biscuit manufacturers and supermarkets have made similar products under the same name. The product's classification as a cake or biscuit was part of a VAT tribunal in 1991, with the court finding in McVitie's favour that the Jaffa cake should be considered a cake for tax purposes. In 2012 they were ranked the best selling cake or biscuit in the United Kingdom.

[[Flora of Azerbaijan]]

CATEGORIES: Biology, Geography of Azerbaijan, Azerbaijan-related lists

Flora of Azerbaijan or Vegetation of Azerbaijan is about the plants, trees, flowers which can be found in Azerbaijan.

Azerbaijan has a very rich flora, where more than 4,500 species of

plants have been documented in the country. Due to the different climate types in Azerbaijan which range from subtropical along the Caspian Sea coast, temperate further inland, and continental and subarctic in the mountains, the flora is much richer in the number of species than the flora of the other republics of the South Caucasus. About 67% of the species growing in the whole Caucasus can be found in Azerbaijan.

Many plant species are also native, and are found in no other country. Another reason why Azerbaijan has many plant species, many of which are relicts of the Tertiary period, is because they were not affected by Pliocene and Pleistocene glaciations and did not become extinct.

The richness of Azerbaijan's flora and the many types of its vegetation also results from its geography and topography that provide many different habitats, like mountains, plains, bodies of water, etc.

The ecosystems found in Azerbaijan where plant life is most widespread, are grassland (mostly in the plains), forest (mostly in the mountains), tundra (in the high mountains) and wetland.

The forest is the ecosystem which has the most number of plant species in Azerbaijan. The forests are found mostly in the Caucasus Mountains, which have a lot of precipitation. The forests in these places are mostly deciduous (which lose their leaves in autumn) and are coniferous in higher elevations. There are also mixed deciduous and coniferous forests in middle elevations.

In drier areas, which are usually in the plains, the forests and plants are xerophytic (resistant to drought).

However, in the steppes found in the plains which are semi-arid grasslands and the largest ecosystem of Azerbaijan, where forests and trees cannot grow, plant life is made up of flowers and some shrubs which are resistant to drought.

[[Akhand Sindhu Sansar]]

"Akhand Sindhu Sansar" is a Hindi word.  In Urdu it is called "Akhand" as continent and "Sansar" as astronomy.

Meaning "Astronomy of the Indus Continent" and their interpretation:

Sindh (Sindhu) 4 inspired books have been revealed on earth  Nowhere is the word Hindu written.

Where the first traces of "bullock cart" "cow".  And the Hindu Goddess  Jhule Lal is also present here.

The history of Sindh which showed its stature and conservatism on the globe of this world in 700 AD is telling everyone what I was, what I was made of!

The Indus, on which the Vedas were written on the Indus River, was the first note (Sargam) of classical music of a united India.

This is the Sindh that invented the "wheel" of technology five or six thousand years ago.  (See Mohan Jo Daro, the first form of bullock cart)

This is the Sindh that, through the Sumerian nation, brought Babylon and Greece to the brink of arch-building.

This is the Sindh whose Mohenjo-daro has found the mark of peace, the traces of the best civilization in the world have been found, and if it has not been found, the name and mark of any weapon so far, which shows that it  Civilization may have invaded another region.

This is the Sindh that is meeting China and Kabul in the north, then Persia in the west, Gujarat in the east and the sea in the south.

There was no Punjab here!

No border or Balochistan

This is the time when the hungry eyes of the Umayyad Empire stare at it, and go to the extent of plundering it ....

And today!  This Sindh is a living proof of the tyranny of Hajjaj bin Yusuf.  Where are the imperialist plays trying to take him from?
