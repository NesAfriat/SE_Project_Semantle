[[Dinosaur Ridge]]

CATEGORIES: Colorado, Dinosaurs of North America, Museums in the United States

Dinosaur Ridge is part of the Morrison Formation, just west of Denver.

The Dinosaur Ridge area is one of the world's most famous dinosaur fossil localities. In 1877, some of the best-known dinosaurs were found here, including Apatosaurus, Diplodocus, Stegosaurus, and Allosaurus. 

In 1973, the area was recognized for its uniqueness as well as its historical and scientific significance when it was designated the Morrison Fossil Area National Natural Landmark by the National Park Service.  In 1989, the Friends of Dinosaur Ridge formed to address increasing concerns regarding the preservation of the site and to offer educational programs on the area's resources.

The rocks on the west side of Dinosaur Ridge are part of the widespread Morrison Formation of Jurassic age. It is in these rocks, where Arthur Lakes discovered the dinosaur bones in 1877. Fifteen quarries were opened along the Dakota hogback in the Morrison area in search of these fossils.

The rocks on the east side of Dinosaur Ridge are part of the Cretaceous Dakota Formation.  When Alameda Parkway was being constructed in 1937 to provide access to Red Rocks Park, workers discovered hundreds of dinosaur footprints.  These were found to include mostly Iguanodon-like footprints. Carnivorous theropod tracks are also present.

The site features the Dinosaur Ridge Exhibit Hall with displays about the dinosaurs found at the site. Additionally, Dinosaur Ridge has interpretive signs at trail locations that explain the local geology, a volcanic ash bed, trace fossils, paleo-ecology, economic development of coal, oil and clay, and many other geologic and paleontological features.

Natural deduction is a branch of mathematical logic developed in Poland in the 1920s and 30s. It is meant to express inference rules closely related to the "natural" way of reasoning.

Spurred on by a series of seminars in Poland in 1926 by Łukasiewicz that advocated a more natural treatment of logic, Jaśkowski made the earliest attempts at defining a more natural deduction. In 1929 he first suggested in 1929 using a diagrammatic notation, and later updated his proposal in papers in 1934 and 1935.

[[Edmundo Ros]]

CATEGORIES: 1910 births, 2011 deaths, Bandleaders

Edmundo Ros (7 December 1910—21 October 2011) was a British bandleader from Trinidad who helped make Latin American dance music popular in London and throughout the Commonwealth. He ran a series of nightclubs in the Soho area of London, and had weekly radio shows on the BBC during World War II and for many years afterwards. He was regularly featured on BBC television in his show Casa de Salta. He was one of the biggest names in recorded Latin music.

Ros's music featured three main types of music: Cuban music, Brazilian music and Caribbean calypsos. Of these genres, Cuban music was the most varied: it included the conga, the ballroom rumba, the mambo, and the cha-cha-cha. Ros introduced the Brazilian samba to England, and it became hugely popular. His Wedding Samba sold three millions copies in 78rpm, for example. He was very popular during the 1950s and 60's.

The orchestrations for his band were designed to smooth the rough edges of Latin music. Ros emphasised the melodic aspects of the music, which he felt was necessary for his audiences. This is something he talked about after his retirement.

He was born in Port of Spain, Trinidad in 1910. He was brought up in Venezuela and went to a military college when he was 18. He learned to play the saxophone, euphonium and the drums. He played with the Venezuelan State Opera, and then won a scholarship to the Royal College of Music in London. He studied to be a conductor at the college in 1937. To earn extra money he played on recordings by other people, including Fats Waller, before starting his own band.

During the war he continued with his music, but also worked as an ambulance driver. After the war he opened the "Edmundo Ros Dinner and Supper Club". He recorded more than 50 albums, the most successful was Rhythms Of the South (Decca 1958), which sold more than a million copies.

He retired to Alicante, Spain in 1975, and made no more recordings. He received the OBE in 2000. He died in 2011 at the age of 100.

[[Nuclear magnetic resonance]]

CATEGORIES: Nuclear physics

Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is the physical phenomenon in which magnetic nuclei in a magnetic field absorb, then re-emit electromagnetic radiation. This energy is of a specific resonance frequency that depends on the magnetic field strength, and the magnetic properties of the isotopes of the atoms. Many scientific techniques exploit the NMR phenomena to study molecular physics, crystals and non crystalline materials through NMR spectroscopy. NMR is also used for advanced medical imaging techniques, for example, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

[[Viking program]]

CATEGORIES: NASA programs, Mars

The Viking program was a NASA mission that sent two spacecraft to the planet Mars. These spacecraft were called Viking 1 and Viking 2. Each spacecraft was made of an orbiter and a lander. The orbiters took pictures of Mars from their orbit and sent information to Earth. The landers gathered scientific data on the surface of the planet.

Both Viking spacecraft were launched in 1975 and both reached Mars in 1976. Scientists chose landing places for both landers from the pictures that the orbiters had taken. Then the landers were released from the orbiters and they went down to their landing places. The orbiters continued to take pictures while the landers studied the surface of the planet and did other things. All of the spacecraft, including both orbiters and both landers, kept working for longer than they had been planned to. Eventually, they broke down. Viking 2 Orbiter stopped working in 1978, Viking 1 Orbiter and Viking 2 Lander in 1980, and Viking 1 Lander in 1982.

The Viking program was the most expensive and difficult mission ever sent to Mars. The program cost a total of US$1 billion. The program was very successful. Most of the knowledge about Mars until the late 1990s came from the Viking mission.

[[Piculet]]

CATEGORIES: Piciformes

The piculets are a subfamily of small woodpeckers which are mostly in tropical South America, with just three Asian and one African  species.

Like true woodpeckers, piculets have large heads, long tongues to get their insect prey and zygodactyl feet, with two toes pointing forward, and two backwards. However, they lack the stiff tail feathers that woodpeckers use when climbing trees. They are more likely to perch on a branch rather than an upright trunk.

They eat insects and grubs mainly from decaying wood. They re-use woodpecker holes for nesting, rather than making their own holes. The eggs are white, as with many hole nesters.

There are 30 species in all. It is known that they split off from mainstream woodpeckers in the middle Miocene about 15 million years ago (mya). Splits between the three genera happened about 7.9 mya.

Typically these birds have grey or dull green upperparts and dark-streaked white underparts.

Moulting (or molting) is the manner in which an animal routinely casts off part of its body (usually the outer layer or covering) at particular times of year, or at specific points in its life cycle.  Moulting is also known as sloughing, shedding, or for some species, ecdysis.

Moulting can involve the epidermis (skin), and hair, fur, wool, or other external layer. In some species, other body parts may be shed, for example, wings in some insects. Examples include old feathers in birds, old hairs in mammals (especially dogs and other canidae), old skin in reptiles, and the entire exoskeleton in arthropods.

[[Voynich manuscript]]

CATEGORIES: Manuscripts, Unreadable writing systems

The Voynich manuscript is a manuscript named after Wilfrid Michael Voynich who bought it in the early 20th century. The manuscript is made up of about 240 vellum pages, and was probably written in the early 15th century in northern Italy. Today, it is in the library of Yale University.

Many pages contain illustrations. Although many authors have been thought to have written this manuscript, the author remains unknown. The text is written in an unknown language, in an unknown writing system. It looks like there are no errors in the text. There are no corrections to it. The text is probably some ciphertext; many people working in cryptography have tried to break its code, both amateur and professional cryptographers. Much less attention has been given to the illustrations, which seem to show plants, anatomic or astronomic links. It has been described as "the world's most mysterious manuscript".

In 2009, University of Arizona researchers performed radiocarbon dating on the manuscript's vellum, which they say (with 95% confidence) was made between 1404 and 1438. In addition, the McCrone Research Institute in Chicago found that much of the ink was added not long afterwards, confirming that the manuscript is an authentic medieval document.

[[Droste effect]]

CATEGORIES: Recursion

The Droste Effect is the name for a picture which contains a smaller image of itself, which in turn contains a smaller image of itself, etc.  It is named after an advertisement.  It is an example of recursion. In art, this is known as mise en abyme. In theory, the recursion goes on forever, but in practice, the number of recursions is limited by the resolution of the image. In practice, there are few iterations, until the size falls below 1 x 1 = 1 px. The reason for this is that this is a geometric progression, and each iteration reduces the size of the image.  It is a visual example of a strange loop, a self-referential system of instancing which is the cornerstone of fractal geometry.

CATEGORIES: Roman people, Roman Republic, 2nd century BC births, 2nd century BC deaths

Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus (163/162 BC- 133 BC) was an important Roman Tribune of the plebs. He proposed a reform called the "Lex Sempronia Agraria". This was meant to reduce the number of poor and homeless people by allowing the rich to have only a certain amount of land. The rest of the land would be given to homeless veterans of the Roman military. But the Roman Senate did not like his plan. They convinced another tribune, named Marcus Octavius, to oppose Tiberius Gracchus. Eventually, enough tension built up that some of the Senators beat Tiberius to death with their chairs and threw his dead body into the Tiber. Tiberius' death is seen as the first death caused by political problems in the Roman government.

Tiberius' brother, Gaius Gracchus, also tried to reform the Roman government and was also killed. Together, the two are called the Gracchi. Their attempts at reform had a lasting effect on Rome, because later on the Senate used some of the ideas from their reforms in their own laws.

[[Zipf's law]]

CATEGORIES: Statistics, Linguistics

Zipf's law is an empirical law, formulated using mathematical statistics, named after the linguist George Kingsley Zipf, who first proposed it. Zipf's law states that given a large sample of words used, the frequency of any word is inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency table. So word number n has a frequency proportional to 1/n.

Thus the most frequent word will occur about twice as often as the second most frequent word, three times as often as the third most frequent word, etc. For example, in one sample of words in the English language, the most frequently occurring word, "the", accounts for nearly 7% of all the words (69,971 out of slightly over 1 million). True to Zipf's Law, the second-place word "of" accounts for slightly over 3.5% of words (36,411 occurrences), followed by "and" (28,852). Only about 135 words are needed to account for half the sample of words in a large sample.

The same relationship occurs in many other rankings, unrelated to language, such as the population ranks of cities in various countries, corporation sizes, income rankings, etc. The appearance of the distribution in rankings of cities by population was first noticed by Felix Auerbach in 1913. 

It is not known why Zipf's law holds for most languages.

[[Tawny owl]]

CATEGORIES: Strigiformes

The tawny owl or brown owl (Strix aluco) is a stocky, medium-sized owl commonly found in woodlands across much of Eurasia.  There are eleven recognised subspecies, and some variation in the colouring. 

The nest is usually in a tree hole where it can protect its eggs and young against potential predators. This owl is resident through the year, and highly territorial. Many young birds starve if they cannot find a vacant territory once parental care ceases.

This nocturnal bird of prey hunts mainly rodents, usually by dropping from a perch to seize its prey, which it swallows whole; in towns its diet includes a higher proportion of birds. Vision and hearing adaptations and  silent flight aid its night hunting. The Tawny is capable of catching smaller owls, but is itself vulnerable to the Eagle owl or Northern Goshawk. Red foxes are an important cause of mortality in newly fledged young.

Although many people believe this owl has exceptional night vision, its retina is no more sensitive than a human's. Rather, it is its asymmetrically placed ears that are key to its hunting. They give the Tawny owl excellent directional hearing. Like most owls, it hunts at night. It has a rather strange, but easily imitated, call.

[[Ocean acidification]]

CATEGORIES: Oceans, Environmental issues, Climate change

Ocean acidification is the decrease in the pH (scale of acidity and alkalinity) and increase in acidity of the Earth's oceans. It is caused by the increase of carbon dioxide (CO2) that humans have put into the atmosphere. More than 30% of the carbon dioxide in the air goes into the oceans. Therefore, when carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increases, the carbon dioxide in the ocean increases, too.

The term fried chicken was first used in the 1830s.

Scottish people were the first European people who were frying chicken, although it was not seasoned or battered. People in West Africa were the ones who seasoned it. However, the first dish which was deep fried was fritters. Fritters were popular during the Middle Ages.

Some fried chicken is marinated in buttermilk and pickle juice before battering.

[[Tidal stream power]]

CATEGORIES: Hydropower

Tidal stream power is electricity made from the tidal movement of water.  A tidal stream generator is a machine that extracts energy from moving water in tides. Tidal stream generators draw energy from water currents in much the same way as wind turbines draw energy from air currents.

Tidal stream power is the cheapest and the least ecologically damaging among the three main forms of tidal power generation.

Tidal stream power is a relatively new technology. It was first conceived in the 1970s during the oil crisis.

The potential for power generation by an individual tidal turbine can be greater than that of similarly rated wind energy turbine. Water is about 800 times the density of air. So, water pushing against a turbine can provide much more power than air pushing against a similar turbine at the same speed. Also, the lowest water speeds needed for an economic power project is lower than the wind speed needed for a wind turbine project. In practice, the tide must move at speeds of at least 2 knots (1 m/s) even close to neap tides to be a source of power. 

As with wind power, selection of location is critical for the tidal turbine. Tidal stream systems need to be located in areas with fast currents where natural flows are concentrated between obstructions, for example at the entrances to bays and rivers, around rocky points, headlands, or between islands or other land masses.

CATEGORIES: History of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 1885 establishments, 1900s disestablishments in Africa

The Congo Free State (État indépendant du Congo) was a large area in Central Africa. It was privately owned by Leopold II, King of the Belgians. Leopold convinced the international community that he was involved in humanitarian work. He attracted scientific and humanitarian backing for the International African Association (Association internationale africaine), which he formed during a Brussels Geographic Conference of geographic societies, explorers, and leaders he hosted in 1876. Leopold used the Association and the defunct "Committee for Studies of the Upper Congo" (Comité d'études du Haut-Congo) as a way to claim most of the Congo Basin. 

Leopold created the International Association of the Congo (Association internationale du Congo) as a new organization. The entity was officially recognized by the Berlin Conference of 1884-85 and various governments. On May 29, 1885, the king named his new colony the Congo Free State (État indépendant du Congo) and ruled it as a dictator (even though he never visited his colony and Africa).

The Congo Free State under Leopold II used slave labor and mutilation of their hands, in order to get full control and force the natives to work at extracting natural resources, mainly rubber and ivory, for Leopold II's personal profit.

His harsh rule was responsible for the deaths of between five to 10 million Congolese people. The Congo became one of the most infamous international scandals of the early 20th century. As a result, Leopold II was forced to give control of it to the government of Belgium. The Belgian government took control in 1908 and created the Belgian Congo.

The Irish Parliamentary Party was a nationalist political party in Ireland. The Party wanted Ireland to be able to govern itself, instead of being governed by the United Kingdom. The Party was created in the nineteenth century by Isaac Butt. Its most famous leader was Charles Stewart Parnell. 

In 1886, the Party helped convince British Prime Minister, William Gladstone, to announce a Home Rule bill. The bill would make Ireland leave the United Kingdom. Ireland would become a British colony which could govern itself. Ireland would have its own parliament, instead of having representatives in the British Parliament.  The bill did not get passed. 

Other Home rule bills were presented later on. They were different from the original because they would have kept Ireland's representation in the British Parliament (instead of giving Ireland its own parliament). None of these bills succeeded. One was passed in 1914, but it was canceled because of the First World War. Another was enacted in 1920, but it failed because of Irish rebellion. It was replaced by an independent Irish Free State, which included most of the island. A Home Ruled Northern Ireland was also created in six counties of Ulster that stayed in the United Kingdom.

[[Li (Confucian)]]

CATEGORIES: Confucianism

Li (禮 pinyin: Lǐ) is a classical Chinese word used in Confucian and post-Confucian Chinese philosophy. The English meaning is "the way things should be done." 

In Li one must be aware of the way one should act and function within a society. In Li one can best cultivate their character by understanding what it entails. Li encompasses most importantly the Doctrine of the Mean, and the Five Constant Relationships.

The Doctrine of the Mean is the way in which one should make decisions in life, in which the best decision is always the middle between unworkable extremes. Taking the middle road as Confucius said would guide one to the way things should be done.

The Five Constant Relationships outline how one should act in society, being the relationships between parent and child, husband and wife, elder sibling and junior sibling, elder friend and junior friend, and ruler and subject. With these constant relationship guidelines, Li sets up a hierarchy between the two people and terms the accepted responses and actions between them.

[[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]]

CATEGORIES: Pulmonology

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), also known as chronic obstructive lung disease (COLD), and chronic obstructive airway disease (COAD), is a collection of diseases which make breathing gradually more difficult.

Symptoms of COPD include difficulty breathing and cough, in particular coughing up lots of phlegm. It is usually caused by smoking cigarettes, and around half of people who smoke for their whole lives will develop COPD. Air pollution can be another cause, particularly in countries where indoor fires are used without ventilation.

At the beginning of the disease, the difficulty breathing is only noticeable when exercising, but over many years it gradually becomes worse, until there is difficulty breathing even when sitting or lying down. It can also lead to infections of the lung, which may be serious enough to cause death. 

The most important step in treating COPD is to stop smoking. Exercise and medications can also help. The most commonly used medications are called bronchodilators, which help to open up the airways and allow more air into the lungs.

3% of all disability is related to COPD. People can die from COPD. The World Health Organization predicts that COPD will become the third leading cause of death worldwide by 2030. It is thought that more people will die from it in the future.

The Irish Parliament (Parlaimint na hÉireann) was a legislature created in 1297 to represent the Anglo-Irish in the English monarch's Lordship of Ireland. Like the Parliament of England, it had its own Houses of Commons and House of Lords. When King Henry VIII of England elevated Ireland to a kingdom in 1541 through an act of the Irish Parliament, he invited the Gaelic Irish to sit in the England Parliament for the first time. However, later English monarchs' penal laws prevented Roman Catholics from entering Parliament. So, the native Irish after this were virtually unrepresented since they were almost all Catholic.

The Irish Parliament's power was restricted by "Poynings law". Poynings Law was a bill sponsored by English Lord Deputy of Ireland Sir Edward Poynings in 1494. In 1782, the bill was repealed and the kingdom of Ireland had brief period of legislative autonomy. But in 1800 it passed a law called the Act of Union to abolish itself and the kingdom of Ireland, and incorporate Ireland into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. After that, the island was represented in the Parliament of the United Kingdom in the Palace of Westminster.

[[Decompression chamber]]

CATEGORIES: Diving

A decompression chamber is a large container that divers can enter after they have surfaced to help their bodies return to normal atmospheric pressure. It is also called a "recompression chamber" or "hyperbaric oxygen therapy chamber".

When a diver returns to the surface too quickly, he can suffer from decompression sickness (also know as "the bends".) To prevent this divers would stop at various points as they returned toward the surface to allow their bodies to adjust to the pressure change.  If a driver uses a chamber, the diver will adjust in the chamber rather than stop at various depths underwater. This eliminates many of the risks of long decompressions underwater, in cold or dangerous conditions.

[[Reactivity (chemistry)]]

CATEGORIES: Chemistry

Reactivity is a measure of how much a substance tends to react with other things. Some substances are more reactive, and others are less reactive. Reactivity is set by several factors:

Reactivity involves both the thermodynamics and kinetics of the particular chemical reaction. A reaction will be more reactive if the total energy of the products is less than the total energy of the reactants. A reaction will be more reactive if the energy of its transition is low.

Lithium reacts with water and air. Gold does not react with water or air. Gold is unreactive, thus low on the reactivity series. Lithium is reactive. There are several ways to measure reactivity. Some are reducing agents, and others can be oxidizing agents. Some absorb water easily. Some break down easily.

The total length of the rail network is 2932, with a 1520 rail gauge which is electrified at 3 kV (3,000 V) DC. The headquarters of the Azerbaijan Railways is in the capital Baku.

The Azerbaijan Railways was made from the Soviet Railways. The Soviet Railways itself came after the Russian Imperial Railways.

After the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, its railway system broke up into national railway systems of many countries which used to be in the Soviet Union. The Republic of Azerbaijan became independent the same year and the Azerbaijan Railways was made.

The first railway line in Azerbaijan was laid in 1878 and was opened in 1880 in the suburbs outside Baku.

There are 2932 kilometers of railway tracks out of which 72% or 2117 kilometers are single railway tracks and 28% or 815 kilometers are double railway tracks which are laid next to each other.

Of the total length of the railway routes 43% or 1272 are electrified.

About 38% of the length of the railway routes or 1126 has full automatic railway signaling systems and 16% or 479 are supported by the communications and repair employees who are responsible for getting and giving the right and trustworthy messages to the train drivers and railway stations on time, and following and repairing the trains and railway equipment.

The railway has 176 railway stations, 2 of which Biləcəri (in Baku) and Şirvan are completely automatic, 12 stations have extra places in railway storage areas for cargo containers with adapted mechanisms and machines, 3 stations – Keşlə (in Baku), Gəncə and Xırdalan are able to supply many cargo containers.

Of the total length of the railway routes 72% or 2117 are for public transport and does not include railway routes for freight rail transport.

A lot of the railway track and trains have to be repaired or replaced. However, with the Kars–Tbilisi–Baku railway, a regional rail link project that will directly connect Turkey, Georgia and Azerbaijan which is being built right now, the railway lines are getting more modern in Azerbaijan with the newest technology and brand new and fast trains will be added. These will replace the old trains which are still being used. The freight market share of the railways are also expected to rise quickly with the completion of the Kars–Tbilisi–Baku railway in 2012.

The total length of the Azerbaijan Railways ranks 57th in length among the countries in the world.

[[Pre-Raphaelite brotherhood]]

CATEGORIES: Art movements, British artists

The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood (also known as the Pre-Raphaelites) was a group of English painters, poets, and critics, founded in 1848 by William Holman Hunt, John Everett Millais and Dante Gabriel Rossetti. The three founders were soon joined by William Michael Rossetti, James Collinson, Frederic George Stephens and Thomas Woolner to form a seven-member "brotherhood". After they had broken up, John William Waterhouse painted in their style. Their influence shrank as the impressionists and post-impressionists became more important.

The group's intention was to reform art by rejecting what they considered to be the 'mechanistic approach'. This was first adopted by the Mannerist artists who succeeded Raphael and Michelangelo. The Brotherhood believed that the Classical poses and elegant compositions of Raphael in particular had been a corrupting influence on the academic teaching of art. So, they are called Pre-Raphaelites. 

In particular, they objected to the influence of Sir Joshua Reynolds, the founder of the English Royal Academy of Arts, whom they called "Sir Sloshua". To the Pre-Raphaelites, according to William Michael Rossetti, "sloshy" meant "anything lax or scamped in the process of painting ... and hence ... any thing or person of a commonplace or conventional kind".  In contrast, they wanted to return to the abundant detail, intense colours, and complex compositions of Quattrocento Italian and Flemish art.

The Pre-Raphaelites continued to accept the idea of history painting, and the imitation of nature, as central to the purpose of art. Despite this, they were a reform movement: they created a distinct name for their form of art, and published a periodical, The Germ, to promote their ideas. Their debates were recorded in the Pre-Raphaelite Journal.

The Brotherhood were highly praised by the art critic John Ruskin, and in turn they were influenced by his ideas. Rossetti's wife Elizabeth Siddal was their favourite model, and she developed into  an excellent artist herself.

[[Lock picking]]

CATEGORIES: Crime, Locks

Lock picking is the art of opening a lock without the key and without damaging or destroying the lock or its door. It is usually used by locksmiths to let people back in who have lost their keys or locked them inside a car or house. Lock picking is very rarely used by criminals, because picking a lock is difficult and other ways of entering such as breaking a window are much easier. Some people pick their own locks as a hobby. In most places picking locks that you own is legal, but it is illegal to pick locks that you do not own or do not have permission to pick.

History of keys and locks goes back for about 4,000 years. Ancient people also wanted to protect their possessions and keep them in places where other people cannot get access to them. The first locks and keys were made of wood and other easily accessible materials and they provided the small safeguard against theft or break-in. However, such locks at least let the owners know if someone tried to tamper with the lock. 

The earliest known key and lock was discovered in the Nineveh ruins, which was the capital of ancient Assyria. They were dated to 704 BC. The first models of wooden locks and keys originate from Ancient Babylon and Egypt. These simple devices had small pins, controlling the movement of the security bolt. In order to unlock the bolt, it was necessary to lift the pins, by using bulky wooden keys. 

Roman age introduced many improvements of the Egyptian wooden locks. Ancient Romans created stronger and smaller locks than Egyptians, by using bronze and iron. The keys of locks from Roman era were small and light enough to be carried everywhere. Such small keys were often viewed as one of the effective ways of showing your wealth to other people. Rich Romans often kept their valuable things in secure boxes and wore the keys as finger rings. 

The warded lock also comes from antiquity and is still the most recognizable lock and key type. Nowadays, there is a wide range of different locks, keys and other security systems available on the market. Among them are also keyless entry systems, that allow people to operate their locks without using the keys.

[[Dale–Chall formula]]

CATEGORIES: Written communication, Linguistics

The Dale–Chall formula is one of the ways to predict how difficult text is to read. It is a readability test. The Dale–Chall formula is a one-variable test: it measures the difficulty of the words used. It does not measure the difficulty of the sentence structure (the syntax).

One of the first readability tests, the Dale–Chall formula used a vocabulary list. It counted the number of listed words in a passage, and applied a formula which gave a grade level. It was used to rate textbooks for grade levels in US school districts. In 1995 the authors published an updated word list.

It is easy, in principle, to use a vocabulary list as part of a computer-based readability measure. The list is organised as a look-up table. The percentage of listed words in a passage gives the data for the formula, and the user is presented with a grade level.

[[Muhammad Ali Pasha]]

CATEGORIES: Ottoman people, 1769 births, 1849 deaths

Muhammad Ali Pasha  (4 March 1769 – 2 August 1849) was an Albanian commander in the Ottoman army. He became Wāli, and self-declared Khedive of Egypt and Sudan.

Though not a modern nationalist, he was the founder of modern Egypt because of the dramatic reforms he made to the army, economy, and culture of Egypt. He also ruled some Levantine territories outside Egypt. The dynasty he established ruled Egypt and Sudan until the Egyptian Revolution of 1952.

Muhammed Ali was born in the Ottoman Empire, in the area which is now the Greek province of Macedonia. His Ancestors was from İliç a City in Asia Minor. He led a group of Albanian troops sent to Egypt. They were part of an Ottoman force that reoccupied Egypt after Napoleon's French troops left. The Ottomans had ruled Egypt by a Wali (Governor) with Mamluk troops. The Mamluks were former slaves.

The French Capitulation of Alexandria left a power vacuum in the Ottoman province. Mamluk power had been weakened, but not destroyed, and Ottoman forces clashed with the Mamluks for power. During this period of anarchy Muhammad Ali used his loyal Albanian troops to play both sides, gaining power and prestige for himself. As the conflict drew on, the local populace grew weary of the power struggle. A group of prominent Egyptians demanded that the then Wāli, Ahmad Khurshid Pasha, step down and Muhammad Ali be installed as the new Wāli in 1805.

The Mamelukes were still powerful, so in 1811 he massacred their leaders and sent troops to chase the followers out of Egypt.

[[Bayesian probability]]

CATEGORIES: Philosophy of science

Bayesian probability figures out the likelihood that something will happen based on available evidence. This is different from frequency probability which determines the likelihood something will happen based on how often it occurred in the past.

You might use Bayesian probability if you don't have information on how often the event happened in the past.

As an example, say you want to classify an email as "spam" or "not spam".  One thing you know about this email is that it has an emoji in the subject line.  Say it's the year 2017, and 80% of the emails you got with emoji in them were spam.  So you can look at an email with emoji in the subject and say it's 80% likely to be spam.

But if only 1% of your emails were spam and 80% of the emojis were spam, that's different than if half your emails are spam and 80% of emoji emails were spam.

Then you can use Bayes's Theorem to determine one probability of whether this email is spam: 

p (is_spam | contains_emoji) =  (p(contains_emoji | is_spam) * p(is_spam))  / p(contains_emoji)

P(xy) = P(xy) * Px / Py

[[George III]]

CATEGORIES: 1738 births, 1820 deaths, Kings and Queens of the United Kingdom, Kings and Queens of Hanover, People Buried in St. George's Chapel at Windsor Castle, 18th century in the Kingdom of Great Britain

King George III (born George William Frederick 4 June 1738  29 January 1820) was King of Great Britain and Ireland from 25 October 1760 to 1 January 1801, when he became King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland until his death. He was also Elector of Hanover, which made him a Prince of the Holy Roman Empire.

During George's reign, he lost control of the United States of America. His two kingdoms, Great Britain and Ireland, were merged into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Also during his reign, the British were at war with republican and Napoleon I's France. The Electorate of Hanover eventually became a Kingdom.

George suffered from periodic bouts of mental illness. One of them caused a crisis in 1788, and attempts were made to nominate his son George IV as regent. The king quickly recovered and prevented that from happening.

George signed the Quebec Act of 1774, which abolished William III's anti-Catholic laws in the American colonies. Also during his reign, George III signed legislation abolishing some of the anti-Catholic Laws in Great Britain and Ireland. For example, the Catholic Relief Acts of 1772 and 1774 allowed Roman Catholics to have land leases in Great Britain. In 1793, Hogart's Act allowed Roman Catholics to vote in Irish elections, but George blocked a proposal in 1800 to allow Catholics to sit in the British Parliament.

In the later part of his life, George suffered from recurrent mental illness, which was eventually permanent. Although it has since been suggested that he suffered from a genetic blood disease, porphyria, the cause of his illness is not certain. After a final relapse in 1810, a regency was established, and George's eldest son, George, Prince of Wales, ruled as Prince Regent. On George III's death, the Prince Regent succeeded his father as George IV.

Because of "his plain, homely, thrifty manners and tastes", George III has had the nickname of Farmer George.

[[Abercrombie River]]

CATEGORIES: Rivers of New South Wales

The Abercrombie River is 130 in length, and passes through the Abercrombie River National Park. It provides habitat for platypus and rakali. The Goulburn-Oberon Road crosses the Abercrombie River in the steep-sided Abercrombie Gorge.

The first people to live alongside the river were Aborigines of the Wiradjuri and Gundungara tribes. They may have used the river as a trading route. The first European to visit the river was explorer Charles Throsby on 5 May 1819, during an expedition from Sydney to the Central West of New South Wales. Alluvial gold was discovered in and along the river in 1851. This started a small gold rush. It was difficult to find gold because of the rough terrain, and changing water levels in the river. Early miners found up to 3 of gold a day along the river. By 1862 about 45 mining parties were working at Milburne Creek, a minor tributary of the Abercrombie. 

It is the furthest east of the inland flowing rivers.

The song features American rapper and songwriter and producer Lupe Fiasco. The original track does not feature Fiasco's addition to the rap versus in the single. In January 2010, Stump announced that he was producing his debut solo album, titled Soul Punk. This came after Fall Out Boy (his main band)'s hiatus in late 2009. His album is a complete solo effort as he is doing everything: performing, composing all music, penning all lyrics, playing over ten instruments and producing, with the album's recording is funded by his own Fall Out Boy earnings. Its musical direction is generally pop/R&B orientated and has been described by Stump as "soul punk" and "smart pop," drawing influence from a wide scope of artists including Prince, Michael Jackson and David Bowie. According to Stump, the song changed the entire course of Soul Punk. "I had written a while draft of the album and then at the 11th hour came up with "This City," I really loved the song but felt like, conceptually, it didn't fit on the album. I had to go back and make an album for that song because I loved it so much. So one of the holdups on album was re-writing the record around it." With Soul Punk originally due in February 2011, Stump delayed it to October 18 and rebuilt the album with the song, releasing Truant Wave EP in the meanwhile for its delay in February 2011. "I had this feeling that the album was disjointed, and right before I was mastering, I played "This City" for my manager — I really liked it, but I was unsure about it, although I thought it was what I wanted to say — and he was like, 'Put it on, it's great! Then I thought, 'Well, if I'm going to put that on the record, then I really need to go back to the drawing board.' Basically I took "This City", "Everybody Wants Somebody", "Allie", and a song called "Dance Miserable", and rebuilt the album around those four songs."

[[Biological control]]

CATEGORIES: Agriculture, Ecology

Biological control, or biological pest control, is the reduction of pest populations by using natural enemies. It is important because crop pests become resistant to chemical pesticides.

Natural enemies of insect pests include predators, parasitoids, and pathogens. Biological control agents of weeds include herbivores and plant pathogens. Predators, such as birds, lady beetles and lacewings, are free-living species that eat many prey during their lifetime. 

Parasitoids are species whose larvae develop on or in a single insect host, ultimately killing or fatally infecting the host. Most have a very narrow host range. Many species of wasps and some flies are parasitoids. 

Pathogens are disease-causing organisms including bacteria, fungi, and viruses. They kill or debilitate their host and are relatively specific.

The Auld Alliance (Scots) (Vieille Alliance) is

an alliance between the kingdoms of Scotland and France. It played a major role in the relations between Scotland, France and England from its beginning in 1295 until the 1560 Treaty of Edinburgh. The alliance was renewed by all the French and Scottish monarchs of that period except for Louis XI. By the late 14th century, the treaty was renewed even when France or Scotland was not at war with England.

The alliance dates from the treaty signed by John Balliol and Philip IV of France in 1295 against Edward I of England. The treaty said that if either country was attacked by England, the other country would invade England. That happened at the Battle of Flodden Field, 1513. The alliance played an important role in conflicts between both countries and England, such as the Wars of Scottish Independence, the Hundred Years' War, the War of the League of Cambrai and the Rough Wooing.

[[Sosigenes the Peripatetic]]

CATEGORIES: Ancient Greek astronomers

Sosigenes the Peripatetic was a philosopher who lived in the 2nd century AD. He followed the Aristotelian school of thought, and was one of the first people to write interpretations and commentaries to Aristotle's work.

He was the tutor of Alexander of Aphrodisias, and wrote a work On Revolving Spheres. On 4th September 164 AD, he watched an 'annular' solar eclipse. He noticed that, unlike a total solar eclipse, the apparent size of the moon was smaller than that of the sun. This meant the distances between the sun, moon and earth were not the same at different eclipses. For this reason, sun and moon could not be on a circular movement around the same centre.

This was a significant discovery. It pinpointed a difficulty with the theory that the earth was the centre of the known universe. Much later, Nicolaus Copernicus used the same idea when he proposed a heliocentric view. In this view, the earth, moon and the planets rotate around the sun, which does not move.

[[Lacewing]]

CATEGORIES: Neuroptera

Lacewings, or 'Green lacewings', are insects in the large family Chrysopidae of the order Neuroptera. There are about 85 genera and (differing between sources) 1,300–2,000 species in this widespread group. However, in America and Europe, the two genera Chrysopa and Chrysoperla are very common.

Most species of lacewings and their larvae are active predators, and are often used for biological control. 

Many adults of Chrysopa can defend themselves by giving out a vile smell from glands at the front of their thorax.

They have 'ears' at the base of their front wings. When they hear bat echolocation sounds, they close their wings and drop down. They can escape spider webs, because, being so light, they  do not create much vibration to alert the spider. Instead of struggling like most insects, the lacewing bites through the strands holding its legs and antennae. When it is stuck only by its wings, it become completely immobile. Slowly, the lacewing slides downwards out of the web. Tiny hairs on the wings prevent the sticky spider silk from touching the wings' surface. 

The larvae are voracious, attacking other insects of suitable size, especially soft-bodied ones (aphids, caterpillars and other insect larvae, insect eggs). When they touch a potential prey object, the larva grasps it. Their maxillae are hollow, and inject a digestive secretion into the prey. The organs of an aphid can be dissolved by this in 90 seconds.

[[Pre-frontal cortex]]

CATEGORIES: Anatomy of the brain

The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is the front part of the frontal lobes of the brain. It lies in front of the motor and premotor areas.

This brain region helps plan complex cognitive behaviours, personality expression, and decision making. It helps correct social behaviour. The basic activity of this brain region is to bring together thoughts and actions to help achieve internal goals.

The most typical psychological term for functions carried out by the prefrontal cortex area is executive function. This is the ability to work out conflicting thoughts. It determines good and bad, better and best, same and different, consequences of current activities, working toward a goal, prediction of outcomes, and expectation of results. Critical is 'social control': the ability to suppress urges which, if not suppressed, could lead to socially unacceptable outcomes.

Many authors have indicated an integral link between a person's personality and the functions of the prefrontal cortex.

[[Lady Macbeth]]

CATEGORIES: Characters in Shakespeare's plays

Lady Macbeth is a fictional character in William Shakespeare's play Macbeth (c.1603–1607). She is the wife to the play's main character, Macbeth, a Scottish nobleman. After talking him into killing the king, she becomes Queen of Scotland. Later, she feels bad about her part in the crime. She dies off-stage in the last act. This is thought to be suicide.

The idea for the character came from Kings Duff and Duncan in Holinshed's Chronicles (1587), a history of Britain familiar to Shakespeare. Shakespeare's Lady Macbeth appears to be made up of two personalities in Holinshed's work. These are Donwald's nagging, murderous wife in the account of King Duff and Macbeth's ambitious wife in the account of King Duncan.

Panic disorder is a serious condition that can happen at any age. It can be treated with psychotherapy and antidepressants.

[[Generalized anxiety disorder]]

CATEGORIES: Anxiety disorders

Generalized anxiety disorder is an anxiety disorder. It is excessive and irrational worry of everyday things. This worry tends to interfere with normal daily functioning. People who have GAD anticipate disasters and they are always concerned about health matters, money, death, their own futures or family trouble. Physical issues may include trembling, numbness, muscle tension, sweating or hot flashes for at least six months.

GAD affects 6.8 million adults, or 3.1% of the U.S. population, in any given year. Women are twice as likely to be affected. The disorder comes on gradually. It can begin at any time. The risk is highest between childhood and middle age. The exact cause of GAD is unknown. Biological factors, family background, and stressful life experiences play a role.

Every year in Australia, about 14 per cent of the population (1 in 7) have an anxiety condition. It is estimated that just under three per cent have GAD. Nearly six per cent of the population have GAD in their lifetime.

Benzodiazepines are one of the medications used to treat this disorder. There is a risk for misuse and addiction. Some types of benzodiazepines are quick-acting and may be used to manage symptoms, but can also lead to abuse or self-medication.

[[Mukden Incident]]

CATEGORIES: History of China, Second Sino-Japanese War

The Mukden Incident, also known as the Manchurian Incident, was an event set up by Japanese soldiers as a reason for invading the northern part of China known as Manchuria in 1931.

On September 18, 1931, a small amount of dynamite was blown up by a Japanese soldier near Japan's South Manchuria Railway near Mukden. Although the explosion was so weak that the rail was still usable, the Japanese army, blaming the action on the Chinese people, fully invaded Manchuria, leading to its occupation. Japan set up its puppet state of Manchukuo six months later. Soon the world knew the event, leading Japan to diplomatic isolation and its withdrawal from the League of Nations.

[[Sensory receptor]]

CATEGORIES: Sensory system

A sensory receptor, or sense organ, is the part which responds to a stimulus in the internal or external environment of an organism. It is the input to the sensory system. In response to stimuli the sensory receptor fires off a nerve fibre which goes to the central nervous system.

In order to detect changes in the environment organisms need receptors. Organisms have various receptors, ranging from simple light or touch sensitive cells to complex nervous systems. 

Receptors are generally specialised for the detection of a specific type of stimulus. 

[[Parietal lobe]]

CATEGORIES: Anatomy of the brain

The parietal lobe is a part of the brain positioned above  the occipital lobe and behind the frontal lobe.  

The parietal lobe brings together information from different senses, particularly spatial sense and navigation. For example, it uses input about touch, balance and the visual system.  This enables the parietal cortex to map seen objects in relation to the body (into 'body coordinate positions'). This makes it possible for a person to reach out and handle objects.

The name derives from the overlying parietal bone, which is named from the Latin pariet-, = 'wall'.

[[Frontal lobe]]

CATEGORIES: Anatomy of the brain

The frontal lobe is an area in the brain of humans and other mammals, at the front of each cerebral hemisphere. It is in front of the parietal lobe and above and in front of the temporal lobes. 

The frontal lobes takes action based on sensory information (sight, sound, touch) from the three rear areas of the cerebrum. The action is moderated by the influence of the pre-frontal cortex. The system is a delicate balance between the need to satisfy urges from the most ancient parts of the brain, such as hunger, self-defence and sex, with the need to act in a way which is socially acceptable. 

The precentral gyrus, forming the back of the frontal lobe, contains the primary motor cortex. This controls voluntary movements of specific body parts.

[[Temporal lobe]]

CATEGORIES: Anatomy of the brain

The temporal lobe is a region of the cerebral cortex that is under the Sylvian fissure on both cerebral hemispheres of the mammalian brain.

The temporal lobe is involved in auditory perception and is home to the primary auditory cortex. It is also important for the processing of semantics (meaning) in both speech and vision. The temporal lobe contains the hippocampus and plays a key role in the formation of long-term memory.

An area in the Sylvian fissure is the first place where auditory signals from the cochlea reach the cerebral cortex. This part of the cortex (primary auditory cortex) is involved in hearing. Other areas of the temporal lobes are involved in high-level auditory processing. In humans this includes speech, for which the left temporal lobe in particular seems to be specialized. Wernicke's area, which spans the region between temporal and parietal lobes, plays a key role (with Broca's area, which is in the frontal lobe). The functions of the left temporal lobe extends to comprehension, naming, verbal memory and other language functions.  

The underside of the temporal lobes do high-level visual processing of faces and scenes. Front parts of this area are involved in object perception and recognition.

Deep inside the medial temporal lobes lie the hippocampus, which is essential for memory function – particularly the transfer from short to long term memory and control of spatial memory and behaviour.

[[Cochlea]]

CATEGORIES: Hearing

The cochlea is the auditory portion of the inner ear. It is a spiral-shaped cavity in the bony labyrinth, making 2.5 turns around its axis.

A core component of the cochlea is the Organ of Corti, the sensory organ of hearing, which is distributed along the partition separating fluid chambers in the coiled tapered tube of the cochlea.

The name is from the Greek κοχλίας kokhlias ("snail, screw"), from κόχλος kokhlos ("spiral shell"). This is in reference to its coiled shape: the cochlea is coiled in most mammals, monotremes being the exceptions.

[[Super Size Me]]

CATEGORIES: American documentary movies, English-language movies, American independent movies

Super Size Me is a 2004 American documentary movie directed by and starring Morgan Spurlock. It is about an experiment where Spurlock ate nothing but food from McDonald's for thirty days. He ate at McDonald's three times a day, eating an average of 5,000 kcal per day. This experiment lasted from February 1 to March 2, 2003. This experiment was bad for his own physical and psychological health. 

During the experiment, Spurlock gained 24½ lbs., had a 13% body mass increase, his cholesterol level went to 230, and he had mood swings, sexual dysfunction, and had fat accumulation in his liver. After the experiment, he recovered with a vegan diet his then-future wife prepared for him (she is a gourmet vegan cook).

This experiment was conducted because of the obesity epidemic in the United States, and because of a case in which two teenage girls sued McDonald's who claimed they became obese as a result of eating food from McDonald's.

Spurlock also uses this movie to criticize McDonald's and the fast food industry, ranging from the sale of unhealthy food to corporate marketing and to the personal profit of these organizations.

[[Non-Newtonian fluid]]

CATEGORIES: Fluid mechanics

A non-Newtonian fluid is a thixotropic fluid which changes its viscosity when the forces on it change.

Other flow properties may also be affected. Most commonly viscosity of such fluids is not independent of the shear rate or the shear rate history. Examples of such fluids are blood, quicksand and certain components of cement. Many lubricants, ketchup, certain forms of dough and pudding also have this property. 

The other kind of fluids that do not show this behavior are called Newtonian fluids.

It is very simple to make a non-Newtonian fluid at home. All one needs is water and cornstarch. Mix these two ingredients together at a rate of one part cornstarch and one and a half parts water. That makes a non-Newtonian fluid.

[[Newtonian fluid]]

CATEGORIES: Fluid mechanics

A Newtonian fluid is a fluid, where the ratio between shear stress changes linearly in proportion to the stress it is exposed to. This proportion is known as viscosity. Note that the inverse is not true; there are fluids with constant viscosity, that are Non-Newtonian fluids: one example is the Boger fluid.

[[Undergraduate education]]

CATEGORIES: Education

Undergraduate education is a level of education wherein a student completes their first degree. The first degree of an undergraduate degree is normally named a bachelor's degree. Therefore, for many subjects in many systems of education, undergraduate education is between secondary education and a bachelor's degree. This education usually takes place in a university. In the United States, a person starting at a university is known as undergraduate while students who have higher degrees are known as graduate students. In some other educational systems and subjects, undergraduate education is between secondary education and a master's degree, for example in some science and engineering courses in Britain and some medicine courses in Europe.

[[Thixotropy]]

CATEGORIES: Physics, Mechanics

Thixotropy is the property of certain gels or fluids that are viscous (thick) under normal conditions, but flow (become thin, less viscous) when shaken, agitated, or otherwise stressed.

In more technical language:

some Non-Newtonian fluids show a change in viscosity; the longer the fluid undergoes shear stress, the lower its viscosity.  A thixotropic fluid is a fluid which takes a finite time to attain equilibrium viscosity when introduced to a step change in shear rate. Many gels and colloids are thixotropic materials, exhibiting a stable form at rest but becoming fluid when agitated. 

Some fluids are anti-thixotropic: constant shear stress for a time causes an increase in viscosity or even solidification. Constant shear stress can be applied by shaking or mixing. They are much less common.

[[Coke (fuel)]]

CATEGORIES: Fuel

Coke is a fuel used mainly in blast furnaces to reduce iron oxide to produce iron. It contains carbon, and is similar to coal. It is made from coal by cooking out things that are not carbon. Coke is a product of destructive distillation of coal. This is done in an airless furnace or oven (kiln) at temperatures as high as 2000 but usually around 1000. This baking drives off volatile parts of the coal, such as water, gas, and tar.

Coke is an almost pure form of carbon. The calorific value (heat energy produced when a fuel is burnt) of coke is about 56,000 kilojoules/kilogram.

Coke is used as a fuel and as a reducing agent in smelting iron ore in a blast furnace.  The carbon monoxide produced by its combustion reduces iron oxide (hematite) to the iron product.

Although coke is more expensive than coal, it can be used in households as a clean fuel, relatively free of smoke and impurities. At the present day its use in domestic heating has been less than oil or gas, but in the 20th century it was often used in kitchen stoves.

[[Squad automatic weapon]]

CATEGORIES: Light machine guns

A squad automatic weapon (SAW, also known as section automatic weapon or light support weapon) is a weapon used to give infantry squads or sections automatic firepower that can easily be moved around. Weapons used for this are selective fire rifles. They usually have a bipod and a heavier barrel so that they can be used as light machine guns. SAWs usually fire the same cartridge as the assault rifles or battle rifles used by other people in the squad/section. This makes logistics easier because only one type of ammunition needs to be given to a unit. SAWs are light enough to be used by one man. However, heavy machine guns such as the Browning M2 are more powerful but need a crew to be as effective as they can be.

The ''Exxon Valdez'' oil spill was a shipping accident that happened off the coast of the United States on March 24, 1989. An oil tanker, the Exxon Valdez, hit a reef in Prince William Sound, Alaska. At the time of the disaster, the ship carried 53,094,510 U.S. gallons (44,210,430 imp gal/200,984,600 L) of crude oil. The accident caused a massive oil spill: 10.8 million U.S. gallons (9.0 million imp gal/41 million L) were spilled into the Prince William Sound. It was one of the worst man-made environmental disasters in the history of the United States.

The ship had left the shipping lanes because of icebergs. The ship never returned to the shipping lane and hit Bligh Reef at around 12:04 AM. Later, people looked at the causes, and found that the people on board were badly trained and overworked. What made things worse was the fact that the government was not prepared to handle a disaster with such large consequences for the environment. This disaster badly damaged the ecosystems of the area. An estimated 21,300 fish died after being poisoned by the crude oil. The birds that ate the fish got sick.

Some of the methods tried to clean up the oil were: burning, mechanical cleaning, and chemical dispersants.

[[Orbital forcing]]

CATEGORIES: Climate, Earth

Orbital forcing is the effect on climate of slow changes in the tilt of the Earth's axis and shape of the orbit (see Milankovitch cycles).  These orbital changes alter the amount of sunlight reaching the Earth by up to 25% at mid-latitudes. In this context, the term "forcing" is a physical process that affects the Earth's climate.

This mechanism is believed to be responsible for the timing of the ice age cycles. The timing of past glacial periods coincides very well with the predictions of the Milankovitch theory, and these effects can be calculated into the future.

Note in the graphic the strong 100,000 year periodicity of the cycles, and the striking asymmetry of the curves. Ice ages deepen by progressive steps, but the recovery to interglacial conditions occurs in one big step.

[[Fermi paradox]]

CATEGORIES: Extraterrestrial life, Paradoxes

Enrico Fermi's paradox wonders why, given the age and size of the universe and that there are billions of stars and planets that have existed for billions of years, we have not detected any other alien civilizations. There have been attempts to resolve the Fermi paradox by finding evidence of alien civilizations, along with thoughts that such life could exist without humans knowing.

The physicist Enrico Fermi first asked the question in an informal discussion in 1950. A paper by Michael H. Hart in 1975 made scientists more curious and they began to study the question in more detail. This is why some people call it the Fermi–Hart paradox. Other common names for the same phenomenon are Fermi's question ("Where are they?"), the Fermi Problem, the Great Silence, and silentium universi (Latin for "the silence of the universe"; the misspelling silencium universi is also common).

These records which were sent in the Voyager spacecraft in 1977, are for alien life forms to see. The outside of the record is designed so that aliens could understand, with instructions about how to play the record next to images. However, the records can be seen as a symbol rather than a serious attempt to contact alien life forms.

The Mexican Revolution was brought on by a major armed struggle in Mexico that started in 1911 by an uprising led by Francisco I. Madero against the long dictatorship of Porfirio Díaz. 

Under his rule, power was concentrated in the hands of a select few, and the people had no power to express their opinions or to select their public officials. Wealth was likewise concentrated in the hands of the few, and injustice was everywhere in the cities and the countryside alike

The revolution was characterized by several socialist, liberal, anarchist, populist, and agrarian movements. Over time, it changed from a simple revolt against the established order to a multi-sided civil war.

There was less fighting after 1920, when Álvaro Obregón, the most important revolutionary leader who was still alive, became the president of Mexico.

Barkly is a very small town in Victoria, Australia, about 180 kilometres northwest of Melbourne. It is located near the junction of the roads from Landsborough to Redbank, and from Frenchmans to St Arnaud. It is close to the western side of the St Arnaud Range National Park.

The area was first called the Navarre Diggings after gold was found in June 1859 by a group led by James Law (1827-1910). It was about six miles from the Navarre township. This caused a gold rush and there were soon about 700 people on the diggings. At the peak of the rush, there were over 6000 people in the area digging for gold.

James Law, who had come to Australia from Scotland, was given a reward of 150 pounds for being the first person to find gold. Other members of his group, John Fewster, W.R. Marshall and George Mill also were rewarded.

The name was changed to Barkly on 1 November 1861, after the Governor of Victoria, Sir Henry Barkly. The name was changed by the local gold warden, Mr. Warden Alley, a government official in charge of the diggings. A school was started, the Barkly Common School.

A cemetery, now called the Pioneer Cemetery, was begun close to the original diggings. The town of Barkly developed about two miles from this area, and a new cemetery was opened.

Barkly has a small Anglican church, a hall, and a few houses. The school has been closed and the buildings removed. There is a rose and lavender farm which is open to the public during the year. A headstone was placed on James Law's grave on 5 May, 1985. In 1996 a memorial stone was placed at the site of the first gold discovery.

[[Bullet-proof glass]]

CATEGORIES: Glass, Armour

Bullet-proof glass, or bullet-resistant glass, is a type of strong, clear material that resists bullets. Complete protection against all weapons is not possible.

It is usually made from two or more types of material, one hard and one soft. The softer layer makes the glass more elastic, so it can flex (bend) instead of shatter. There must be a clear view through the glass. Bulletproof glass varies in thickness from three-quarters of an inch to three inches.

A popular method is stick a special plastic film to the inner surface of ordinary glass. This 'security laminate' bonds to the glass with an adhesive. This gives a protection similar to the multi-layered bullet-resistant glass. Transparency is better, tint-free; thickness and weight is reduced as much as 50-70%. The laminate can be stuck on to existing windows; this a called a 'retrofit'.

The AVR microcontroller architecture was developed by Atmel in 1996. It is based on the Harvard microcontroller architecture. The AVR was one of the first microcontroller families to use on-chip flash memory for program storage, as opposed to one-time programmable ROM, EPROM, or EEPROM used by other microcontrollers at the time.

Many people think that AVR stands for Alf (Egil Bogen) and Vegard (Wollan)'s Risc processor".

This architecture replaces older MCS-51 architecture. One machine cycle of MCS-51 takes 12 clock cycles and most of  instructions are executed in one machine cycle.

AVR microcontrollers (MCUs) can execute most of instructions in single machine cycle too, but one machine cycle takes only one clock cycle. Performance per clock cycle is 12 times higher with AVR.

The core has 32 general purpose registers directly connected to ALU. It allowing two independent

registers to be accessed and instruction with them executed in one machine cycle.

[[Ultralight material]]

CATEGORIES: Materials

Ultralight materials are very light substances. They include silica aerogels, carbon nanotube aerogels, metallic foams, polymeric foams, and metallic microlattices. The density of air is about 1.275 mg/cm3, which means that the air in the pores greatly lowers the density of the material.

The lightest material ever made was invented in 2011. It is made out of a microscopic micro-lattice of hollow tubes – a criss-cross diagonal pattern with open spaces between the tubes. The researchers say the material is 100 times lighter than Styrofoam and is very strong. The material is low density: it has a density of 0.9 milligrams per cubic centimetre. Silica aerogels, the world's lightest solid materials, are only as low as 1.0 mg per cubic cm. The metallic micro-lattices are 99.99% air and only 0.01% solid. The metal used is nickel.

The material is not just light: it has some elastic properties. When it is squashed, the little tubes are also squashed, but when the pressure is removed, they rebound. A sample squashed to half its height rebounds 98% when the pressure is lifted. That makes the material similar in some ways to elastomers: they are materials used to cushion against shock.

[[Mars Science Laboratory]]

CATEGORIES: NASA spacecraft, Mars

The Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) is a NASA mission to land and control a rover named Curiosity on the surface of the planet Mars. The MSL was launched on November 26, 2011. The MSL successfully did the first-ever precision landing on Mars. It landed on Mars at Gale Crater on August 5, 2012 and began exploring the surface.

The goal of the Curiosity rover is to study the history of Mars. It was to see whether Mars has, or ever had, an environment able to support microbial life. It indeed did that, finding evidence that 3 Billion years ago there was once water and a life-supporting environment. It is important to know that it found that life COULD HAVE existed, not that it certainly DID. It will also carefully look at samples scooped up from the soil and drilled powders from rocks.

Curiosity is five times as heavy as the Mars Exploration Rovers Spirit or Opportunity and carries more than ten times their mass of scientific instruments . It was launched by an Atlas V 541 rocket. Curiosity will be expected to work for at least 1 Martian year (668 Martian sols/686 Earth days), but may live a lot longer than that. It will explore Mars with greater range than any other rover.

Mars Science Laboratory mission is part of NASA's Mars Exploration Program. The program is a long-term mission of robotic exploration of Mars. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology manages the program for NASA. The total cost of the MSL project is about US$2.3 billion.

[[Folie à deux]]

CATEGORIES: Psychosis

Folie à deux is the name for a condition where an otherwise sane person develops the symptoms and delusions of a person suffering from psychosis. If more than two people share the symptoms or delusions, people speak about folie à trois (3), folie à quatre (4), folie à plusieurs, or folie en famille. Officially, the condition is known as induced delusional disorder or shared psychotic disorder today, but many publications still use the original terms, which were developed in France in the 19th century.

Today, there are two main forms of the condition:

Newer studies seem to indicate that this classification may not be sufficient to fully describe 'folie à deux'. There may be more symptoms than are usually described in the cases above. Also, in many cases, separating the two patients may not be enough to make the condition go  away in one of them. Also, the person described as "sane" before developing the folie à deux may already be suffering from a psychiatric illness, or may develop one. 

The condition was first described in an article pubilshed by Ernest-Charles Lasègue and Jules Farlet in 1877.

Mass hysteria can be seen as a form of folie à deux.

[[SnRNP]]

CATEGORIES: RNA, Molecular biology

Small nuclear RNA (snRNP, or snurps), joins with proteins to form spliceosomes. The spliceosomes govern alternative splicing.

The background to this is that, in eukaryotes, most genes code for a protein in separated strings of DNA. This is because, of a total gene, coding bits (exons) are separated by non-coding bits (introns). The process called alternative splicing can produce many possible proteins from the gene parts because the proteins are put together in different ways. Alternative splicing produces alternative messenger RNAs, and these produce different proteins. Spliceosomes control the details of the splicing.

The two essential components of snRNPs are protein molecules and RNA. The RNA found within each snRNP particle is known as small nuclear RNA, or snRNA, and is usually about 150 nucleotides in length. The snRNA component of the snurp is specific to individual introns because it 'recognises' the sequences of critical signals at the ends and branch sites of introns. The snRNA in snurps is similar to ribosomal RNA: it acts both as an enzyme (catalyst) and builds structure.

SnRNPs were discovered by Michael Lerner and Joan Steitz.

Thomas Cech and Sidney Altman also played a role in the discovery, winning the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1989 for their independent discoveries that RNA can act as a catalyst in cell development.

[[Halkett boat]]

CATEGORIES: History of Canada, Boats

A Halkett boat is a type of lightweight inflatable boat. The boat was first created by Lt Peter Halkett (1820–1885) during the 1840s. Halkett had been interested in the problems of travelling in the Canadian Arctic. He wanted to make a boat that was light enough to be carried over bad terrain, but strong enough to be used in very bad weather conditions.

Halkett's first design was a boat that was made using cloth combined with rubber. This boat could be filled with air (inflated) to float on water or the air could be removed (deflated) so it would be smaller and lighter to carry. When deflated, the hull of the boat could be worn as a cloak. The oar used as a walking stick and the sail could be used as an umbrella. Next, he created a two-man boat that was small enough to fit into a knapsack. When it was deflated, It could be used as a waterproof blanket.

Many people who explored Canada liked his ideas but they were not very useful to most other people. He tried to show the  Royal Navy that the boats could be useful to them but did not succeed. He also could not sell them fishermen and people that hunted duck. They were commercially unsuccessful. Only two Halkett boats are still known to exist. One belonged to Orcadian explorer John Rae. The other is in the Hudson's Bay Company Museum Collection at the Manitoba Museum.

[[Mackenzie Large Igneous Province]]

CATEGORIES: Geography of Canada, Proterozoic, Volcanoes of Canada, Flood basalts

The Mackenzie Large Igneous Province (MLIP) is a major Mesoproterozoic large igneous province of southwestern, western and northwestern Canada. It is a group of igneous rocks which were formed during a massive igneous event starting about 1,270 million years ago. The large igneous province extends from the Arctic in Nunavut to near the Great Lakes in northwestern Ontario.

MLIP is one of the largest Proterozoic magmatic provinces on Earth, as well as the world's largest and best-preserved continental flood basalt terrain. This huge area of igneous rock was spewed out in a short time, geologically speaking. The MILP is much larger than other well-preserved large igneous provinces. The standard size classification for large igneous provinces is a minimum of 100000. However, the Mackenzie dyke swarm itself occupies an area of at least 2700000, making the Mackenzie Large Igneous Province larger than the Ontong Java Plateau in the southwestern Pacific Ocean or the U.S. state of Alaska.

The Mackenzie Large Igneous Province was caused by processes other than normal plate tectonics and seafloor spreading. Igneous rocks of the Mackenzie Large Igneous Province are generally mafic in composition, including basalt and gabbro.

[[Gabbro]]

CATEGORIES: Igneous rocks

Gabbro is a large group of dark, coarse-grained, igneous rocks. They are chemically equivalent to basalt. The rocks are plutonic, formed when molten magma is trapped under the Earth's surface and cools into a crystalline mass. 

Most of the Earth's surface has gabbro in the oceanic crust, produced by basalt magmatism at mid-ocean ridges. In general, when the gabbro is formed, it lies above the Earth's mantle, and below the basalt.

Gabbro is generally coarse grained, with crystals in the size range of 1 mm or greater. It is an essential part of the oceanic crust. Long belts of gabbro intrusions are typically formed at proto-rift zones and around ancient rift zone margins.

[[Facies]]

CATEGORIES: Sedimentary rocks

Facies is a term in geology. It means the look of a rock. If one looks up at a cliff of rock, the appearances changes from one layer to another. This because the ecological conditions changed as the rock was laid down. So, the facies reflect the process of sedimentation. 

Regular changes in the facies usually means regular changes in the ancient climate. As the climate chaged, so the sea level rose and fell. What was deep water became shallow water, and so on. In the Milankovich cycle, the climate changes regularly. As it does so, deeper water carbonates may alternate with shallow-water shales and silts. These facies are seen in the column of rocks.

[[Floorball]]

CATEGORIES: Team sports

Floorball is an indoor team sport similar to hockey. Floorball is usually played in gyms with little plastic balls and special hockey sticks. In floorball, there are basically five players with sticks and a goalkeeper without any special equipment. The goalkeeper has only special jersey and helmet. Floorball is very popular today.

Floorball was invented in the USA, but has been most popular in Sweden since the 1970s. Its popularity quickly spread to Finland and Switzerland, but with different rules. For example, in Switzerland a goalkeeper was allowed to use a stick.  In 1986, the International Floorball Federation (IFF) was founded and rules became the same.

Floorball is played in a gym on an area of 40x20 meters bordered by boards 50 centimetres high. The formations are very similar to ice hockey. Both teams play with 3 attackers, 2 defenders and a goalkeeper. They can relieve whenever they want. Floorball is usually played 3x20 minutes with 15 minutes breaks. This is only for men and women. In juniors matches the time is different. Floorball is a contact sport so players can play with their body, but it has limits. The goalkeeper is not allowed to use a stick, but he can handle the ball with his body. The field players cannot hit the ball with their hands or head and they cannot jump. The goalkeeper can hit the ball with every part of his body and he can hold it for 3 seconds. In floorball, a player can be excluded for 2 minutes when he breaks the rules.

The currently strongest leagues are located in Sweden, Finland, Norway, Switzerland and the Czech Republic.

IFF organises world championships in floorball. Every year they are in a different country and it's also alternating between the mens and the womens tournament.

Patrick Murphy (1834–1862) was an Irish giant, born in County Down from parents James Murphy and mother Peggy (née Cunningham), who put himself in a show as a way of making money. He originally worked on the docks in Liverpool, England and, after that, became a waiter at a hotel. Because he was so tall, Murphy attracted crowds everywhere he went. He eventually decided that he could make a living being tall. He always spoke of himself as being 8'10" and in some circles as much as 9'3". In about 1860, he was measured by a Dr. Virchow as being 7'3.4" (222 cm) tall.

In May 1857 the Emperor and Empress of Austria invited the tall Irishman to visit their kingdom.  While he was on tour throughout Europe, he died of smallpox in Marseille at the age of twenty-eight.

[[Oppidum]]

CATEGORIES: Latin words and phrases, Archaeological sites, Fortification, Places of Ancient Rome

Oppidum (plural oppida) is a Latin word for the main settlement in any administrative area of ancient Rome. The word comes from ob-pedum, an "enclosed space." This may in turn have come from the Proto-Indo-European word, *pedóm-, meaning an "occupied space" or "footprint."

Julius Caesar called the larger Celtic Iron Age settlements he found in Gaul oppida. The word is now used to describe the large pre-Roman towns that existed across Western and Central Europe. Many oppida grew from hill forts, but not all of them had an important defensive role. The main features of the oppida are:

The development of oppida was an important step in the urbanisation of Europe. They were the first large settlements north of the Mediterranean that could be described as towns. Caesar pointed out that each tribe of Gaul would have several oppida, but that they were not all of equal importance. This suggests that there was some form of hierarchy.

In conquered lands, the Romans took over the oppida to administer the empire, and many became full Roman towns. This often involved a change of location from the hilltop into the plain.

One of the best preserved oppida is at Enserune in France. It was occupied continuously from 6th century BC until the 1st century. Other oppida are now buried beneath large cities, such as Vindobona which is covered by Vienna.

[[Thermal expansion]]

CATEGORIES: Thermodynamics

In physics, thermal expansion is the likelihood of matter to change in volume in response to a change in temperature. When a substance is heated, its basic particles move around more quickly and by doing so generally maintain a greater average separation. Materials that contract with an increase in temperature are very uncommon; this effect is limited in size, and only occurs within limited temperature ranges. The degree of expansion divided by the change in temperature is called the material's coefficient of thermal expansion and generally varies with temperature. 

Thermometers are an example of using thermal expansion. They contain a liquid which can only move in one direction (along the tube) when volume changes along with temperature.

Thermal expansion can become a problem for trains because it can cause the rails to buckle. On the rails they will have monitors so that if it does get abnormally high in temperature they can be warned and trains could be told to slow down to reduce the heat of friction. Sometimes on the inner parts of the rails they will be painted white to reflect the sun's hot rays so that it won't cause buckling.

[[Algal bloom]]

CATEGORIES: Algae

An algal bloom is an accumulation of algae (typically microscopic) or a rapid increase in their amount in a body of water. Algal blooms may occur in fresh water as well as salt water. Algal bloom concentrations may reach millions of cells per milliliter of water. Algal blooms are often green, but they can also be other colors such as yellow-brown or red, depending on the species of algae. So-called algal blooms are often caused by Cyanobacteria such as Aphanizomenon flosaquae, which are no longer considered to be algae. Some kinds of algal blooms, such as red tides, are poisonous.

Algal blooms are often caused by eutrophication. Eutrophication occurs when abnormal amount of nutrients, especially phosphorous and nitrogen, enter a body of water. Algal blooms are a big problem to ecosystems because, like any sudden unnatural growth, it harms the other animals in that ecosystem, usually decreasing their numbers quickly. The abundance of algae in algal blooms causes layers of algae that are unable to get sunlight, and this causes the algae to die and start to decompose. The top layers of algae is able to photosynthesize and continue living. The lack of nutrients and dissolved oxygen in the water inhibits other life. Fish become unable to breathe and other aquatic vegetation cannot photosynthesize. All the organisms in the water start to die and decompose. The decomposition of the dead organisms use up most of the remaining dissolved oxygen in the water. Without a sufficient amount of nutrients and dissolved oxygen all living organisms in the water die which leads to a dead zone.

[[Samuel Morse]]

Samuel Finley Breese Morse (April 27, 1791 – April 2, 1872) was an American inventor. He was the first person to make a telegraph with only one wire, and also helped come up with the idea of Morse code.

Since the 1700s, there were different types of telegraphs being made, but they were hard to use because they had several wires. (The first telegraph ever built had 26 wires, which made it almost impossible to use.) Morse spent years trying to build one with only one wire, and managed to do it in 1836. Morse and his assistant made a code with "dots and "dashes", which were two different types of "clicks" on the telegraph.

Morse's invention made it possible to quickly communicate with people far away, and many telegraph lines were built. A telegraph line using his invention was built between Washington, D.C. and Baltimore in 1844. By the 1860s, there were telegraph lines all around North America, and in 1866, a telegraph line was built across the Atlantic Ocean.

[[Uncanny valley]]

CATEGORIES: psychology, Robots

The uncanny valley is a psychological theory about the effect involving art and robots and human emotions. As something starts to look more human-like, there is a point at which people start to feel it looks wrong. At this point, they have negative feelings toward the object. These feelings keep getting worse as the object is made to look more human-like. At a certain point, as the object starts to get very close to looking human-like, how people feel towards it tend to reverse and they have more positive emotional feelings towards it. The theory was created by the robotics professor Masahiro Mori in 1970.

One of the main points of the theory to explain this is that people are not as affected in an emotional way by the object if it is easy to tell it is not human. After a certain point, people start to feel emotionally about it, but feel negatively because it is so nonhuman. As it gets closer to looking human, they start to feel more positive emotions towards it. A graph of these feeling shows a valley. This is part of the reason for the naming of the theory.

[[Video camera]]

CATEGORIES: Cameras, Electronics, Data input

A video camera is camera used to make electronic motion pictures.  It captures moving images and synchronous sound. Early video cameras were all analog and most modern ones are digital.  Analog video cameras produce signals that can be displayed with analog televisions.  The signals can be shown at the time, or can be stored in an analog format on magnetic tape.  Digital video cameras produce digital images.

Video cameras were invented early in the 20th century for television use, and by the end of the century, people could buy digital video cameras, which can almost immediately display the image. Video recorders that could record the image on magnetic tape were created in the middle 20th century.

At first, video cameras were large and expensive.  Only professionals operated them.  As the electronics industry advanced, and solid state circuits with transistors and microprocessors replaced vacuum tubes, video cameras became smaller and inexpensive.  Now many mobile phones and other consumer electronic devices include video cameras.  In addition, software is now widely available to edit or to compress the output from video cameras.

[[Aggression]]

CATEGORIES: Human behavior

Aggression refers to behavior between members of the same species that is intended to cause humiliation, pain, or harm.

Ferguson and Beaver defined aggressive behavior as "Behavior which is intended to increase the social dominance of the organism relative to the dominance position of other organisms”

Aggression takes a variety of forms among humans and can be physical, mental, or verbal.

There are two types of aggression - hostile, affective aggression and instrumental, predatory, or goal-oriented aggression.

Reactive relational aggression (hostile, affective, retaliatory) is used in response to feeling attacked, threatened, or mad. Usually the person who shows this type of aggression feels provoked to do so. Instrumental relational aggression (predatory, goal-oriented) is used in order for an individual to get what they want.

Predatory or defensive behavior between members of different species is not normally considered as "aggression."

Like most, or even all behaviors, aggression can be examined in terms of its ability to help an animal reproduce and survive. Animals may use aggression to gain and secure territories, as well as other resources including food, water, and mating opportunities.

The most apparent type of aggression is that seen in the interaction between a predator and its prey. An animal defending itself against a predator becomes aggressive in order to survive and predator in order to secure food. Because aggression against a much larger enemy or group of enemies would be nearly certain to lead to the death of an animal, animals have developed a good sense of when they are outnumbered. This ability to gauge the strength of other animals gives animals a "fight or flight" response to predators; depending on how strong they gauge the predator to be, animals will either become aggressive or flee.

Although humans share aspects of aggression with non-human animals, they differ from most of them in the complexity of their aggression because of factors such as culture, morals, and social situations.

CATEGORIES: Chemistry, Proteins

The Protein Data Bank (PDB) is a collection of information about the three dimensional (3-D) structure of large biological molecules, such as proteins and nucleic acids. Biologists and biochemists from around the world send in the data. Most data comes from X-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy. Anyone can access the PDB for free online. The Worldwide Protein Data Bank, wwPDB, manages the PDB.

The PDB is useful for scientists studying structural biology and structural genomics. Many scientists have to send their information to the database. Major scientific journals and some funding agencies, such as the National Institutes of Health in the United States have rules telling scientists to send the data to the PDB. The PDB has the original or primary data. Hundreds of other databases reuse the data. These secondary databases organize the information in different ways. For example, both SCOP and CATH put structures into groups organized by type of structure and ideas about how they are related through evolution. Gene ontology puts the data into groups based on genes.

[[Prequel]]

CATEGORIES: Drama, Literature, Movie industry

Prequel is a term in drama and literature: it means the opposite of sequel. When a story is told in several stages, it is natural to tell it in order of time. For example, a series of books on the Second World War started with the 1930s, and ended up in 1946. 

For various reasons, this does not always happen. In the movie series Star Wars, the first movie was Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope (1977). It was followed by three prequels, which were Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace (1999); Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones (2002) and Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith (2005).

For correct use, the term 'prequel' is only applied when work is part of a series, and when the later publication refers to an earlier time. It is an old idea, but one which is often used today for drama on movie and television. The Cypria, a work of Ancient Greek literature, is a prequel to Homer's Iliad. A related idea is the back-story, which is the background story of a main story or character.

[[Map projection]]

CATEGORIES: Map projections

A map projection is a way of showing the surface of a three-dimensional sphere on a flat surface. Such projections are necessary to create maps. The problem with projections is that they change the surface in some way; this is called distortion. Depending on the purpose of the map, some distortions may be less bad. This is why cartographers use different mathematical projections for different maps.

Carl Friedrich Gauss showed that is not possible to project the surface of a sphere to a plane, without distorting it. This theorem is known as Theorema egregium today.

To understand the projections, it is easier to imagine a light source, a globe, and another geometric object. The light source shines "a shadow" of each point of the globe onto the geometric object. At the end the surface of the geometric object is unrolled, this yields the map. It is possible to tell the projections apart by the type of helper object used.

Contemporary art means modern art done after Pop Art and Conceptual Art. Another term, which really means the same thing, is postmodern art. Yet another term, which goes wider than art, is Postmodernism.

This problem of labelling comes about because the word 'modern' in art was used for some art from the mid-Victorian period through the whole 20th century. It covers a wide range of styles and movements. So when art critics wanted to describe post-WWII art they had to use a different word. Thus, in art, 'contemporary' (which really means 'at the same time as') comes to mean 'modern', and modern comes to mean 'earlier'.

[[Ethernet hub]]

CATEGORIES: Computers

An ethernet hub is an electronic device that runs a computer network. It is a simple device and is easy to configure. A hub acts like a repeater: all data that arrives to one port is sent to all other ports (without looking at IP address for the data's destination). That means that all devices in this network will get all data. A hub is a very simple device and does not operate Ethernet traffic. In contrast, a switch hub has a lower latency. Many hubs have LED signal lamps to show the state of the hub (which ports are connected and if the hub is working). A "collision" happens when two or more devices on the same network try to send packets at the same time. When collisions happen all of the devices have to go through a routine to resolve the conflict.  The process is set in the Ethernet Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) protocol.

Some hubs may also come with a BNC and/or Attachment Unit Interface (AUI) connector to allow connection to legacy 10BASE2 or 10BASE5 network segments.

There are three kinds of hubs:

[[Languages of Canada]]

CATEGORIES: Languages by country, Canada

Lots of languages are used in Canada. English and French are used by most Canadians. Only New Brunswick uses both English and French as its official languages. Quebec's official language is French. English and French are recognized by the Constitution of Canada as "official languages." This means that all laws of the federal government are in both English and French and that federal government services can be available in both languages.

Many Canadians believe that the relationship between the English and French languages is important. 

To know how many people speak them, Canada's census collects a lot of kinds of information not collected in most other countries, including home language, mother tongue, first official language and language of work.

People speak other languages. About 18% of Canadians (about 6.1 million people, most are immigrants) have a language other than English or French as their first language or mother tongue. Nearly 3.5 million Canadians continue to use their other language most often, like when at home or in social settings. The biggest ones are Italian, German, Chinese, Punjabi, Arabic and Dutch.

Canada also has many native languages. But they are not spoken by many people (less than one percent of Canada), and fewer people speak them every year.

British North America, where slavery was not allowed, was a popular stopping point, as its long border gave many points of access.  More than 30,000 people were said to have escaped there using the network at its best, although U.S. Census statistics shows only 6,000.

The ADR was founded on May 28, 1918 after the collapse of the Russian Empire that began with the Russian Revolution of 1917 by the Azerbaijani National Council in Tiflis, Georgia. Its borders were with Russia in the north, Democratic Republic of Georgia in the north-west, Democratic Republic of Armenia in the west, and Persian Empire (Iran) in the south. It had a population of 2.86 million. Ganja was the temporary capital of the Republic as Baku, which is the de jure capital, was under Bolshevik control.

Under the ADR, the government was a parliamentary system in which a parliament, called the Milli Majlis (National Assembly of Azerbaijan) elected on the basis of universal, free, and proportional representation, was the highest political institution of state authority and the Council of Ministers was responsible before it. Fatali Khan Khoyski became its first prime minister. Besides the political party Musavat who had the majority in parliament, other political parties were Ehrar, Ittihad, Muslim Social-democrats as well as representatives of Armenian (21 out of 120 seats), Russian, Polish, Jewish and German minorities gained seats in the parliament. Some members supported Pan-Islamist and Pan-Turkist ideologies.

Among the important accomplishments of the parliament was to give women the right to vote, making Azerbaijan the first Muslim nation to give women equal political rights with men.  Apart from this accomplishment, Azerbaijan made these reforms earlier than the United Kingdom and the United States. Another important accomplishment of ADR was the establishment of Baku State University, which was the first modern-type university founded in Azerbaijan.

[[Computer network]]

CATEGORIES: Computer networking

A computer network is a group of two or more computers that are linked together. Networks are usually used to share resources, exchange files or communicate with other users.

A network is a set of nodes connected by communication links.  A node can be a computer, printer, or any other device capable of sending or receiving data from or to the other node in the network.

Other devices are often needed for the network to work correctly.  Examples for such devices include hubs and switches.  Different kinds of network can be connected to each other with a router.  In general, networks that use cables to connect can operate at higher speeds than those using wireless technology.

A Local Area Network (LAN) connects computers which are close together. Building a LAN is easier than connecting different networks (by a Wide Area Network). The largest Wide Area Network is the Internet. (Different Area Networks are classified based on their range.)

Computers can be part of several different networks. Networks can also be parts of bigger networks. The local area network in a small business is usually connected to the corporate network of the larger company.  These connections may allow access to the Internet.  For example, a shop may use it to show merchandise on its Web site through a web server, or to convert received orders into shipping instructions.

A network must be connected with appropriate hardware. This can be wired or wireless. For a simple LAN, computers, media and peripherals are sufficient. WANs (wide area networks) and some large LANs (local area networks) need some additional devices like a bridge, gateway or router to connect different small or large networks.

A network needs a communication protocol (a system for exchanging messages between computing systems.) Microsoft Windows, Linux and most other operating systems use TCP/IP. Apple Macintosh computers used Appletalk in the 20th century, but use TCP/IP now.

CATEGORIES: Cupressaceae, Plants of North America

Sequoia is a genus of redwood trees in the Cupressaceae family. It includes the largest trees in the world. The only living species of the genus is  Sequoia sempervirens, the coast redwood, in northern California and southern Oregon in the United States. Several other species have been named from fossils, but are now extinct. These include Sequoia affinis, Sequoia chinensis in China, Sequoia langsdorfii, Sequoia dakotensis of South Dakota, and Sequoia magnifica. Other related species of the subfamily Sequoioideae include Sequoiadendron Giganteum, the Giant Sequoia  and Metasequoia Glyptostroboides, the Dawn Redwood.

The oldest known fossils in the Sequoia genus are those of Sequoia jeholensis, which have been found in Jurassic deposits of southern Manchuria. By the late Cretaceous it had spread to other parts of China, Europe, and western North America.

Giant sequoia  are much more recent in the fossil record, appearing 25 million years ago. They grow only in 75 groups across 35,600 acres in California, near the Sierra Nevada mountains. These groups were formed as a protection from logging. The most famous area with giant sequoia trees is Sequoia National Park. The park was made as the second national park, after the Yellowstone in 1980. The Sequoia National Park is managed with Kings Canyon National Park. Together, the two parks are called Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks. Several trees in Sequoia National Park have even been named, for example General Grant, the Grizzly Giant or General Sherman.

[[New Bern, North Carolina]]

CATEGORIES: Cities in North Carolina, County seats in North Carolina, Former United States state capitals

New Bern (ˈnjuːbərn) is a city in Craven County, North Carolina. It has a population of 29,524. It is located where the Trent and the Neuse rivers meet. The city is 112 east of Raleigh and 80 northeast of Wilmington. New Bern is the county seat of Craven County. New Bern is the birthplace of the international drink, Pepsi Cola.

New Bern was a Native American town named Chattoka. Swiss immigrants moved to New Bern in 1710. It was named after the capital of Switzerland: Bern.  Bern is bear in the German language, and the flags of both towns have the drawing of a bear.

New Bern is the second oldest town in North Carolina. It was the capital of the North Carolina colonial government and the state capital for a short time until 1792. After the American Revolution, New Bern became rich and quickly developed a rich cultural life. At one time New Bern was called "the Athens of the South." After Raleigh was named as the state capital, New Bern rebuilt its economy with the help of trade routes to the Caribbean and New England. It reached a population of 3,600 in 1815. During the 19th-century Federal period, New Bern was the largest city in North Carolina.

New Bern has four historic districts with homes, stores and churches dating back to the early eighteenth century. Close to the waterfront are more than 164 homes and buildings listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Also nearby are several bed and breakfast inns, hotels, restaurants, banks, antiques stores and specialty shops. Tryon Palace, the home of British governor William Tryon, was built in 1770.  It was used as the original state capitol building of newly independent North Carolina. It burned down in the 1790s. People can now visit a replica, built from the original plans and on the original foundation. The Masonic Temple and the Athens Theater are both still very active today. The Masonic Theater is the oldest theater in America in continuous use.

The historic districts also are home to many of the town's 2,000 crape myrtles — New Bern’s official flower — and gardens. The district has flowering dogwoods and azaleas.

Union Point park is where the Neuse and Trent Rivers join. It is the city’s major celebration spot for events such as Neuse River Days and the Fourth of July. In 1979, the local government gave Swiss Bear Downtown Revitalization Corp — a nonprofit corporation of civic leaders — control of the failing downtown area. Today, art galleries, specialty shops, antiques stores, restaurants and inns have changed downtown and the waterfront into a social hub. Improvements are still being made. Built in 1995 through the efforts of Swiss Bear, James Reed Lane is a downtown mini-park and pedestrian walk-through on Pollock Street across from historic Christ Church. Private restoration efforts have returned many of the downtown buildings to their turn-of-the-last-century elegance.

[[Ecological footprint]]

CATEGORIES: Environmental issues

An ecological footprint measures how much people take from nature. The footprint is then compared to the amount of natural resources nature can renew. The ecological footprint takes into account how much farm land, forest area, grazing land and sea area it takes to provide everything people use. More simply, footprint calculations answer the questions: how much nature do we have? And how much do we use?

When analyzing the world as a whole, humanity is using nature about 1.7 times faster than nature renews itself. It is like using 1.7 planet Earths. Since people consume differently around the world, it is also possible to calculate how many planet it would take if everybody around the world consumed like a particular population. For instance, if everybody consumed like the Germans, it would take nearly 3 planet Earths. Expressed in area: The ecological footprint per world citizen is about 2.8 global average hectares per person while there are only 1.6 global hectare of biologically productive land and water per person on Earth. This means that humanity has already overshot global biocapacity by 70% and now lives unsustainably by depleting stocks of "natural capital". 

All this data is based on the 2020 assessment from Global Footprint Network, York University, and FoDaFo. It uses 2017 data.

[[Environmental impact of aviation]]

CATEGORIES: Environmental issues, Aviation

Air travel has a major impact on the world's environment, especially the atmosphere. With fast globalisation, air traffic has quickly increased, and is one of the biggest causes of climate change.

This is due to the noise pollution emitted from the aircraft while it is flying. It also takes fuel to fly the planes which causes pollution. Aircraft pollution has increased a great deal although flying or taking a transportation method that can carry more than a few individuals at a time is more environmentally friendly than a smaller vehicle.

Public awareness of the impact of aircraft on the environment is a lot less compared with automobiles.

[[Water footprint]]

CATEGORIES: Water

A water footprint is the amount of freshwater used by individuals, groups or companies in order to make goods or provide services used by the community. These goods and services may be needed around the entire world. A water footprint can be determined by math for any well-established group of users, or producers. It is measured by dividing the total amount of water used, by the water that became polluted, in the same area during the same amount of time. While the water footprint of an organization is a good indicator for its water consumption and pollution, it does not show how other water sources are affected. More studies will need to be done in order to determine the effect of the water footprint on water sources.

[[Multiple sclerosis]]

CATEGORIES: Health problems

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a serious health condition that gets worse over time. In this disease, the body’s natural guard against illness (the immune system) damages fatty coverings called myelin sheaths around the nerve cells (neurons) in the central nervous system. The disease has different effects in different people, and can make people’s bodies, eyesight, speech, and minds work poorly. People with MS do not normally live as long as healthy people.

In healthy people, myelin sheaths help neurons work.  Electric signals in neurons move quickly through long, narrow axons like electricity in a wire. The myelin is like the insulator around the wire that keeps the signal strong by keeping it from moving out of the wire before the end. - In person with MS infiltration of immune cells induces inflammation within the CNS resulting in demyelination. The progressive degeneration of the myelin sheath, as well as the loss of myelin-producing cells oligodendrocytes, impair the ability of remyelination. Without the protective covering, the signals between neurons do not travel well. Because of this, the mind and body cannot work like they normally do.

Raleigh was born to a Protestant family in East Budleigh, in Devon, the son of Walter Raleigh and Catherine Champernowne. Walter Raleigh was married to a woman called Elizabeth Throckmorten. He had 3 sons named Damerei Raleigh, Walter Raleigh and Carew Raleigh.

In 1594, Raleigh heard of a "City of Gold" in South America and sailed to find it, writing an exaggerated story of his trip in a book. He explored North Carolina all the way down to Florida. This book made people believe in the legend of "El Dorado". After Queen Elizabeth died in 1603, Raleigh was put in prison because he was accused of trying to overthrow King James I, who did not like Raleigh. In 1616, he was released to go look for El Dorado again. This was unsuccessful, and Raleigh's men attacked a Spanish outpost. He returned to England. The Spanish were upset, so to calm them, England arrested Raleigh and executed him by beheading (decapitation) on 29 October 1618.

[[Rings of Uranus]]

CATEGORIES: Uranus (planet)

The rings of Uranus are planetary rings (circles of rock and dust) that go around the planet Uranus. There are 11 rings in total. In order of increasing distance from Uranus, they are: 1986U2R/ζ, 6, 5, 4, α, β, η, γ, δ, λ, ε, ν and μ.

Nine rings were found on 10 March 1977 by James L. Elliot, Edward W. Dunham and Douglas J. Mink. Scientists found two more rings in 1986 in images from the Voyager 2 spacecraft and two outer rings in 2003–2005 in images from the Hubble Space Telescope.

Most of the rings are only a few kilometres wide and are very dark. Most rings are made of rocks 0.2–20 meters wide. But some rings are made of very small dust particles. The closest ring is 38,000 km away from the center of Uranus and the furthest ring is 98,000 km away.

Scientists think that the rings are at not more than 600 million years old. The ring system was created when several moons crashed together. After crashing, the moons broke up into many pieces and made rings.People may discover more rings.

[[Equilibrium constant]]

CATEGORIES: Physical chemistry, Analytical chemistry

Equilibrium constant is a mathematical quantity which expresses the relationship between products and reactants of a reaction at equilibrium with respect to a specific unit. In other words, equilibrium constant is the reaction quotient of a chemical reaction at chemical equilibrium. The equilibrium constant can help us to understand whether the reaction tends to have a higher concentration of products or reactants at equilibrium. We can also use to Equilibrium constant determine if the reaction is already at equilibrium.

There are several different types of equilibrium constants that provide relationships between the products and the reactants of a chemical reaction at chemical equilibrium in terms of different units. Dissociation constants can be used as an example.

[[Carbon diet]]

CATEGORIES: Environment, Green politics

Carbon diet is the process of reducing the production of greenhouse gas, primarily carbon dioxide, to reduce effects on climate change and global warming.

Carbon dioxide is produced from heating, driving and consuming products.

The production of carbon dioxide can be reduced by decreasing the intake of carbon, and eventually reduces the effects of climate change.

According to Deborah Jones, her family undergoes carbon diet. They are already in week two of the Globe and Mail assignment. The purpose of this assignment is to see how her family can reduces the emissions of greenhouse gas to reach the provincial goal of 33 percent reduction. It is different from a low carbon diet which is done by choosing what to eat to reduce greenhouse gas discharge.

[[Numerical control]]

CATEGORIES: Tools

Numerical Control (NC) is a way to automate machines. In numerical control, the commands these machines get come from a storage medium; they are not controlled and operated manually. The first such machines were Jacquard looms controlled by punched cards. Machine tools for cutting metal were built in the 1940s and 1950s. They used punched tape instructions. Soon, the tools were changed, to use computers. Numerical control with computers is known as Computer Numerical Control, or CNC.

Nowadays, it is possible to make a program that can run on such machine tools, based on a CAD drawing of the piece to be produced.

Attempts to automate machines in the 19th century, for example copying-lathes, used cams. These are basically wheels that change the position of notches to control a machine. The basic difference to modern NC is that these cams only automated one given task; modern NC and CNC machines can be programmed to a greater extent.

[[Crowbar]]

CATEGORIES: Tools

 A crowbar is a metal tool used mainly to pry things open. It is usually hook shaped. Sometimes the bottom is slightly curved to allow for better leverage. Some crowbars have a notched an end for removing nails. Crowbars are often made of carbon steel. They can also be made of titanium which is lighter and non-magnetic. The first known use of the word was somewhere in the 1400s where they were simply called crows or iron crows.

It is used as a lever either to force apart two objects or to remove nails. Crowbars are commonly used to open nailed wooden crates. Common uses for larger crowbars are: removing nails, prying apart boards, and generally breaking things. Crowbars can be used as any of the three lever classes but the curved end is usually used as a first-class lever, and the flat end as a second class lever. In mining, crowbars are used to break blasted rocks and to remove loose rock on roof sides and the working face, but not much in modern mining.

[[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]]

CATEGORIES: Atlantic Ocean, Plate tectonics, Geography of Iceland

The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is where seafloor spreading takes place in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. It is part of a world-wide system of mid-ocean ridges. These ridges make up the longest mountain range in the world, all underwater except for short stretches like Iceland. On Iceland, the Mid-Atlantic Ridge reaches the surface.

The ridge separates oceanic tectonic plates, and moves the plates apart at about 2.5 cm per year.

The Mid-Atlantic Ridge includes a deep rift valley which runs along the middle of the ridge along almost its entire length. At the rift, the boundary between tectonic plates, magma from the mantle reaches the seafloor. New magma emerges onto the ocean floor near the ridge axis. The crystallized magma forms new crust of basalt and gabbro.

[[Surface area to volume ratio]]

CATEGORIES: Geometry

The surface area to volume ratio of an object is the relationship between two measurements. It is the ratio of Surface area to volume.  It shows the comparison between the size of the outside of an object and the amount inside. Small or thin objects have a large surface area compared to the volume. This gives them a large ratio of surface to volume. Larger objects have small surface area compared to the volume so they have a small surface area to volume ratio. A large lump, for example, has a small ratio, and may be smashed into powder to give it a large surface to volume ratio.

Two common ways of writing it are sa/vol or SA:V. Either of these say to divide the surface area by the volume. This shows how much surface area is required for each unit of volume.

[[Metabolism (architecture)]]

CATEGORIES: Architectural styles

Metabolism is a kind of architecture that began in Japan around 1960. This way of designing buildings came out of the rebuilding of Japan after World War II. Members of the group include: Kiyoshi Awazu, Noboru Kawazoe, Kiyonori Kikutake, Kisho Kurokawa, Fumihiko Maki, Masato Otaka, and Kenzō Tange. They wrote a short book in English and Japanese called "The proposals for a New Urbanism" for the World Design Conference in 1960. Many Metabolist projects or designs were very large city plans called megastructures. The members thought of cities as living things that changed over long periods of time.

These architects were interested in building housing for large numbers of people. They often planned buildings that could be changed. One example is the Nakagin Capsule Tower by Kurokawa (1972). Each apartment was a rectangular block with one round window. These blocks could be added, moved, or removed as needed. It was a "plug-in building". Kurokawa planned for new, better capsules to be added to replace old ones. However, people living in the tower plan to tear it down and rebuild a larger building.

[[Gas discharge lamp]]

CATEGORIES: Lamps

Gas discharge lamps are a family of artificial light sources (or lamps). These lamps produce light by sending electricity through an ionized gas. Most of these lamps use a noble gas, or a combination of noble gases, but they often contain other materials, such as mercury, sodium or metal halides. The gases in these lamps are ionized in operation. This means that there are free electrons. When an electric current is sent through the gas, electrons collide with atoms of the gas and the metals. This will mean that some reach a higher energy state. When they fall back into the lower energy state, they will emit the energy in the form of light. 

The fluorescent lamp is probably the best known gas discharge lamp. Sodium vapor lamps are commonplace as streetlights.

Gas-discharge lamps have a long life and a high efficiency, but they are more complicated to manufacture, which makes them more expensive to buy than incandescent lamps. Due to their greater efficiency, gas-discharge lamps replacing incandescent light bulbs for many purposes in the late 20th century. Early in the 21st century, light-emitting diodes improved, with even higher efficiency. They began to replace some gas discharge lamps.  

[[Charged particle]]

CATEGORIES: Electromagnetism, Physics

A charged particle, also called an ion, is an atom with a positive or negative charge. This happens whenever something called an ionic bond forms. Two particles that have different numbers of electrons (the smallest particle in an atom which is negative) start reacting to each other. The particle that has the greater amount of electrons steals the other particle's electrons. One becomes positive because it lost an electron, and the other negative because it got another electron. The two particles become attracted to each other and mix together, making a new kind of particle.

[[Germicidal lamp]]

[[Carmen Amaya]]

CATEGORIES: 1913 births, 1963 deaths, Dancers, Musicians from Barcelona, Spanish singers

Carmen Amaya (2 November 1913 – 19 November 1963) was a flamenco dancer and singer, of gypsy origin, born in the Somorrostro slum of Barcelona, Spain. 

She has been called "the greatest Spanish gypsy dancer of her generation". and "the most extrardinary personality of all time in flamenco dance".

She danced from the time she was 4 years old. Accompanied on the guitar by her father, she danced in waterfront bars in Barcelona. A young person who saw her dance as a girl was the Spanish guitarist Sabicas (Agustín Castellón Campos). He later said "I saw her dance and it seemed like something supernatural to me... I never saw anyone dance like her. I don’t know how she did it, I just don’t know!". Sabicas accompanied her for many years. He recorded Queen of the Gypsies (1959) and Flamenco! with Amaya.

In 1929, she made her debut in Paris, to warm acclaims and admiration of her dancing skill. She moved to America in 1936, where she went on to act in several movies that broke box office records, including the Romeo and Juliet adaptation Los Tarantos, and the short movie Danzas Gitanas (Gypsy dances). 

One thing was strange about her: she often danced in trousers rather than the layered skirt traditional for female flamenco dancers. One theory is that she did this to give more scope to her footwork, which was exceptional, and rather like a flamenco male dancer. Apparently, in early flamenco, women did not do so much footwork, and male dancers used to fill in the steps while sitting on chairs, unseen in the wings.p100 Her style has been described as repetitive because she always did the same dances: "Carmen was a fabulous dancer, but limited" (Antonio Ruiz Soler).

She was invited by Franklin Roosevelt to dance in the White House in 1944, and also by Harry S. Truman in 1953.

Amaya is buried in the Cementiri del Sud-Oest on Barcelona's Montjuïc.

It is considered by many experts to be the most dangerous type of asbestos. It can cause cancer and asbestosis. It was formerly used in Kent brand cigarettes as a filter material. It is rare in construction compared to white asbestos, but it is sometimes found in caulking, cement, wallboard, rope, and numerous other products. Due to its hazards, blue asbestos is no longer mined commercially.

[[Waterfowl hunting]]

CATEGORIES: Leisure

Waterfowl hunting (also called wildfowling or waterfowl shooting in Britain) is the act of hunting ducks, geese, or other waterfowl for food and sport. In many western countries, waterfowl hunting is illegal, and duck hunting is mostly an outdoor sporting activity. 

Many types of ducks and geese share the same habitat, have overlapping or same hunting seasons, and are hunted the same. Thus it is possible to hunt different species of waterfowl in the same trip. Waterfowl can be hunted in crop fields where they eat, or, more often, on or near bodies of water such as rivers, lakes, ponds, swamps, sloughs, or oceanic coastlines.

Play therapy is a kind of therapy counseling with playing activities which makes children overcome their psychological difficulties by themselves and helps them to achieve optimum level of development. Young children are usually hard to express their emotion, needs, and thoughts by language, but it can be possible through their play activities. So, play can be children's language to show their state. Also, they can release stress, and have self-confidence by playing freely what they want and getting good words from therapists.

For therapists, they should know about human development including child development. Also, they need to know to apply different kinds of playing activities for children. But, the most important thing is to have good relationship with the children. 

There are many kinds of play therapy.

[[Online shopping]]

CATEGORIES: Shops, Internet

Online shopping is the process whereby consumers directly buy goods or services from a seller in real-time, without an intermediary service, over the Internet. It is a form of electronic commerce. An online shop, eshop, e-store, Internet shop, webshop, webstore, online store, or virtual store evokes the physical analogy of buying products or services at a bricks-and-mortar retailer or in a shopping center. The process is called business-to-consumer (B2C) online shopping. When a business buys from another business, it is called business-to-business (B2B) online shopping.

In 1991 the Worldwide Web opened for commercial use.  In 1994 other advances took place, such as online banking and the opening of an online pizza shop by Pizza Hut.   During that same year, Netscape introduced Secure Sockets Layer encryption of data transferred online, which has become essential for secure online shopping.  Also, in 1994, the German company Intershop introduced its first online shopping system.  In 1995, Amazon launched its online shopping site, and in 1996, eBay appeared.

An ovipositor is the long hollow tube on the rear of female insects (and some other animals). Through this tube they lay eggs. The ovipositor is formed by the union of three pairs of rear appendages.  

In many species it is a piercing organ which allows the insect to put its eggs into a specific place. In some species of wasp, the female drills through tree bark with her ovipositor and lays eggs in the bodies of grubs eating under the bark. 

However, in many hymenoptera the ovipositor is used as a sting, and the female does not use it for egg-laying.

[[Zork]]

CATEGORIES: Zork, Adventure games

Zork was one of the first interactive fiction computer games and a descendant of Colossal Cave Adventure. The first version of Zork was written in 1977–1979.

"Zork" was originally MIT hacker slang for an unfinished program. The creators named the completed game Dungeon, but changed it back to Zork after receiving a trademark violation notice from the publisher of Dungeons & Dragons. Zork has also been adapted to a book series.

Three of the original Zork programmers joined with others to found Infocom in 1979. That company adapted Zork into Zork I-III, a trilogy of games for most popular small computers of the era. Personal Software published what would become the first part of the trilogy under the name Zork when it was first released in 1980, but Infocom later handled the distribution of that game and their later games. Part of the reason for splitting Zork into three different games was that, at the time, micros did not have enough memory and disk storage to handle the entirety of the original game. In the process, more content was added to Zork to make each game stand on its own.  A version of Zork I was issued as a hidden 'easter egg' in Call of Duty: Black Ops. It has exactly the same text and rules as the original.

[[Samgyetang]]

CATEGORIES: Korean food, Soups

Samgyetang is Korean ginseng chicken soup. It’s a food commonly eaten during the summer, especially on the three days called ‘bok day’s.

Samgyetang is made of a whole young chicken stuffed with sticky rice, ginseng, jujube, garlic, and ginger. The chicken is “closed” shut and cooked in a soup. The richness of the broth depends on the style of the cook, as is the added  ingredients that may be added. Some Samgyetang broths are cooked for hours. This broth is added to the chicken cooking separately to create a very rich soup. Other broths are lighter and clear.

Samgyetang is usually served with salt and pepper, which is put in a small separate dish to dip the meat. Some people like to add the seasoning directly into the soup. It is usually served with kkakdugi (radish kimchi) and some restaurants will offer regular kimchi as well.

[[Gristmill]]

CATEGORIES: Grains, Technology

A gristmill (usually flour mill in British English) grinds grain into flour. Grist can refer to both the grain that has been separated from its chaff and to the ground grain.

Most old ones are watermills.

They typically have a waterwheel and from 1 to 3 stones for grinding, although some have more. Water pours on to the wheel causing it to spin. This movement causes an axle inside to turn. The axle is connected to a gear which causes the grinding stones to spin. At the top, there is a chute filled with grain. The grain slowly falls through into the grinding stones.

There are different ways to transmit power from the waterwheel to the stones. The simplest method is known as a single-geared drive. Only one set of gears is used to drive a single stone. This arrangement was used since vertical waterwheels were used in gristmills and was still used until the 19th century.

Another method was known as spur-wheel drive. This method used a set of bevelled gears that would drive a horizontal 'spur-wheel', a large gearwheel that would then drive up to 3 or 4 millstones.

Another arrangement was known as a layshaft drive. The waterwheel would drive a horizontal 'layshaft' with gears mounted on it. Each gear would drive one set of stones.

[[Appendage]]

CATEGORIES: Animal anatomy, Developmental biology

An appendage is a part of animals attached the main body. Many arthropods have appendages on each, or most, of their segments. Millipedes, for example, have many segments, and almost all carry two legs. Insects have exactly six legs, two on each segment of the thorax. Antennae (feelers) attached to their heads are another type of appendage.

Wings, parts of the tail, legs, some mouthparts, external sex organs can all be described as appendages.

Appendages may be uniramous, as in insects and centipedes, where each appendage comprises a single series of segments, or it may be biramous, as in many crustaceans, where each appendage branches into two sections. 

All arthropod appendages are variations of the same basic structure (homologous). Which structure is produced is controlled by homeobox genes. Changes to these genes have allowed scientists to produce animals (such as Drosophila melanogaster) with modified appendages, such as legs instead of antennae.

[[List of political parties in Azerbaijan]]

CATEGORIES: Political parties in Azerbaijan, Politics of Azerbaijan, Lists of political parties, Azerbaijan-related lists

This is a list of political parties in Azerbaijan.

Azerbaijan is a one-party dominant state, meaning that is a system of majority rule where one political party, in this case the ruling New Azerbaijan Party, has successively won election victories by a very large majority and is therefore the dominant ruling party, which does not have to form coalitions (alliances) with other smaller political parties as a result. The one party dominant state differs from a one-party state, because opposition parties against the New Azerbaijan Party are allowed, but are widely considered to have no real chance of gaining power. 

[[One-party dominant state]]

CATEGORIES: Political systems

The one-party dominant state is a system of majority rule where one political party has successively won election victories by a very large majority and is, therefore, the dominant ruling party, which does not have to form coalitions (alliances) with other smaller political parties as a result. 

The one-party dominant state differs from a one-party state, because opposition parties against the dominant ruling party are allowed, but have no real chance of gaining power. 

Many one-party dominant states are dictatorships where only one party can by law be in control, but some one-party dominant states are real democracies, where there are no limits by law against other parties.

A case of this was Mexico, where Presidential candidates (the person running for this governmental office) of the Institutional Revolutionary Party were popularly elected for more than 70 years.

Another example is South Africa, where the African National Congress has been the ruling party of post-apartheid South Africa since the democratization of the country with the election of Nelson Mandela in the 1994, winning every election since then. During the apartheid era, the National Party of South Africa ruled from 1948 to 1994 and imposed apartheid. 

In one-party dominant states that are dictatorships, the ruling party often stays in power through electoral fraud and gerrymandering, and also by suppressing the opposition who don't accept this for moral reasons, which totally undermines the political legitimacy of the ruling party and the system.

O. Henry was the pen name of the American writer William Sydney Porter (September 11, 1862 – June 5, 1910). O. Henry's short stories are well known for their  clever twist endings.

O. Henry, pseudonym of William Sydney Porter, original name William Sidney Porter(born Sept. 11, 1862, Greensboro, N.C., U.S.—died June 5, 1910, New York, N.Y.) American short-story writer whose tales romanticized the commonplace—in particular the life of ordinary people in New York City. His stories expressed the effect of coincidence on character through humour, grim or ironic, and often had surprise endings, a device that became identified with his name and cost him critical favour when its vogue had passed.

Among his most famous stories are:

[[Kenneth G. Wilson]]

CATEGORIES: 1936 births, 2013 deaths, American academics, American Nobel Prize winners, American physicists, Deaths from lymphoma, Harvard University alumni, Scientists from Massachusetts, Theoretical physicists, Wolf Prize winners

Kenneth Geddes Wilson (June 8, 1936 – June 15, 2013) was an American theoretical physicist and Nobel Prize winner.

As an undergraduate at Harvard, he was a Putnam Fellow.  He earned his PhD from Caltech in 1961, studying under Murray Gell-Mann.  

He became a junior faculty member in Cornell University Physics Department in 1963. He became a full professor in 1970.  In 1974, he became the James A. Weeks Professor of Physics at Cornell. He was a co-winner of the Wolf Prize in physics in 1980, together with Michael E. Fisher and Leo Kadanoff.  He got the 1982 Nobel Prize in Physics for combining quantum field theory and the statistical theory of critical phenomena of second-order phase transitions. In other words the prize was for his constructive theory of the renormalization group. In this theory he gave not only important, and even numerical, insights to the field of critical statics and dynamics in statistical physics, but indirectly also basic answers to the question: "What is quantum field theory?" and "What does renormalization mean?". He also gave a constructive answer to another important  "renormalization" problem from solid-state physics, the Kondo effect.

He advocated that the federal government should buy supercomputers for science research. In 1985, he was appointed as Cornell's Director of the Center for Theory and Simulation in Science and Engineering (known now as the Cornell Theory Center, one of five national supercomputer center created by the National Science Foundation.  Since 1988, Dr. Wilson has been a faculty member at The Ohio State University.  His current research interests include physics education research.

Some of his PhD students include Roman Jackiw, Steve Shenker, and Michael Peskin.

Wilson's father was the prominent chemist E. Bright Wilson, and his brother David is also a Professor at Cornell in the department of Molecular Biology and Genetics.

Wilson died on June 19, 2013 from lymphoma in Saco, Maine, aged 77.

He was a very hard worker and explorer.

[[Apex (diacritic)]]

CATEGORIES: Alphabetic diacritics, Latin language

In written Latin, the apex (plural: "apices") is a diacritic. It is close to the shape of an acute accent ( ´ ). The apex is used to show that a vowel is long and not short. That means that the vowel is pronounced for longer.

The shape and length of the apex can be different. It can even sometimes be different within the same writing. While pretty much all apices are made up of a line sloping up to the right, the line can be more or less curved, and is different in length from less than half the height of a letter to more than the height of a letter. Sometimes, it is put at the top with a hook, pointing out to the left. Rather than being centered over the vowel it changes, the apex is often drawn to the right.

Later, it developed into the acute accent, which is still used in some languages to mark vowel length. In particular, Czech and Slovak, Hungarian, Irish, and (a long time ago) Icelandic.

[[Acute]]

Acute can mean:

[[Differential geometry]]

CATEGORIES: Geometry

Differential geometry is a field of mathematics. It uses differential and integral calculus as well as linear algebra to study problems of geometry. The theory of the plane, as well as curves and surfaces in Euclidean space are the basis of this study. Big discoveries were made in the 18th and 19th century. In geometry, the sum of the angles of a triangle is 180 degrees. Carl Friedrich Gauß wondered whether triangle bearings of ships really has a sum of angles of exactly 180 degrees; with this question he was among the pioneers of modern differential geometry.

A long time ago, differential geometry was used for map projections. Today, it is used for fields as diverse as general relativity theory, or satellite navigation. Grigori Perelman's proof of the Poincaré conjecture uses differential geometry.

[[New Azerbaijan Party]]

CATEGORIES: Political parties in Azerbaijan, Nationalist organizations in Azerbaijan

The New Azerbaijan Party (Yeni Azərbaycan Partiyası, YAP) is the ruling political party in Azerbaijan since 1993.

It was formed on 18 December 1992 by the former President of Azerbaijan Heydar Aliyev, who led it until his retirement and death in 2003.

[[A cappella]]

CATEGORIES: Singing

A cappella music is music where people sing without instruments.

In a choir, there are up to 5 parts: soprano, alto, tenor, baritone, and bass. A cappella can also have those 5 parts. A difference is with percussion. With musical instruments, percussion is done with musical instruments that you hit, such as drums. In an a cappella performance, a person makes the percussion sound. For a beatbox performance, performers make sounds like electric drums, synthesizer and electric guitar. Another part of percussion in a cappella performance is making classical drum sounds for tapping the beat.

The word a cappella is Italian for "in the manner of the church" or "in the manner of the chapel".  It was first used in religious music.  Gregorian chant is an example of a cappella singing.

[[Spanking]]

CATEGORIES: Punishments

Spanking is hitting the buttocks of another person to cause them pain. Spanking normally means hitting the buttocks of another person with an open hand.  Parents in some countries spank children and teenagers to punish them.  In some other countries this is no longer allowed.  Parents often hope that spanking will make the children obey them. From the past up to the present day, adults have spanked boys more than they have spanked girls.

When a parent spanks their child, they usually strike the child's buttocks with their open hand.  Sometimes they  use other objects such as a belt or a wooden spoon.  At times the child's buttocks may be clothed.  At other times they may be bare.  Often the parent makes the child lie across their lap.  At other times, a parent might tell a child or teenager to bend over or lie face down across a bed.

When children are asked how they feel when their parents spank them, many say that it makes them feel sad, angry, and afraid.  Some young children in the United Kingdom whose parents spanked them said things like, “it feels like someone banged you with a hammer” and “it hurts and it’s painful inside – it’s like breaking your bones”. 

The American Academy of Pediatrics is a group of medical doctors who work with children.  They say that spanking is not a good way to help children learn how to behave.  They say that it can easily injure a small child.  They say that spanking can lead to child abuse.  They say that parents should never spank a child with an object.

Some groups of people have said that spanking is violent and goes against human rights.  They are people like lawyers, social workers, and politicians.  Spanking a person under the age of 18 is now against the law in more than 40 countries.  Some of those countries are Brazil, Germany, Israel, Argentina, Sweden, Netherlands, Spain, Poland, New Zealand, Kenya, and Costa Rica.

Dr. Elizabeth T. Gershoff is a scientist who studies spanking.  She says that research done over many years shows that spanking does not work.  She says that spanking does not teach children good behavior or to obey their parents.  She says that children who are spanked obey their parents less as time goes on.  Dr. Gershoff said that spanking is "violent" and should be stopped.  In 2012, a group of Canadian  scientists also looked at many years of research and found that spanking does not work.  They said that over time, spanked children become more aggressive.  Murray Straus is another scientist studying spanking of children.  He has said that there is new research showing that spanked children commit more crimes when they grow up.  He said that this was so even if their parents were "loving" to them.

A small number of scientists have claimed that ordinary spanking does no harm.   Other scientists say that "over 100" studies have shown that spanking can harm children.  They say that spanking harms children's mental growth.  They also say that children who are spanked grow up to have more mental illnesses.  They say that no study has shown any good to come from spanking.   Scientists at the University of Manitoba in Canada found that children who were hit even "sometimes" suffered more mental illnesses when they grew up.  They could have different kinds of mental illnesses: long-lasting sad or discouraged feelings and a loss of pleasure and interest in life (depression), a lot of fear and worry (anxiety), racing thoughts that are hard to control and acting without thinking (mania), or a need to take drugs or alcohol to feel well (drug and alcohol abuse).  Other scientists have discovered that spanking children often can make their brains grow less than they should.  These children end up less able to think clearly.  They also try to hurt others more.

[[Green chemistry]]

CATEGORIES: Environmental chemistry

Green chemistry (or sustainable chemistry) is a type of chemical research and engineering. It supports the design of products and processes that use as little dangerous substances as they can. 

Environmental chemistry is the chemistry of the natural environment and of pollutant chemicals in nature. But green chemistry wants to reduce and prevent pollution at its source. In 1990, the Pollution Prevention Act was passed in the United States. This law sought original and new ways to handle pollution. It aims to avoid problems before they happen.

Green chemistry applies organic chemistry, inorganic chemistry, biochemistry, analytical chemistry and even physical chemistry.  While green chemistry seems to focus on just industrial applications, it does apply to any chemistry choice. Green chemists reduce the hazards and increase the efficiency of any chemical choice. It is distinct from environmental chemistry which focuses on chemical phenomena in the environment.

[[Toxicity]]

CATEGORIES: Toxicology

Toxicity is the degree to which a substance can damage an organism. It is the subject-matter of toxicology.

A central idea in toxicology is that almost everything is toxic when taken to excess. Effects are dose-dependent: even water can lead to 'water intoxication' when taken in too much. For even a very toxic substance such as elapid snake venom there is a dose below which there is no toxic effect. 

Toxicity is species-specific. A dose which is toxic to one animal may not be toxic to another.

[[Mountain pygmy possum]]

CATEGORIES: Marsupials of Australia, Diprotodonts

The mountain pygmy possum (Burramys parvus) is a small, mouse-sized (weighs 45 g) nocturnal marsupial of Australia. It is found high up (1300 to 2230 metres) in rock screes and boulder fields of southern Victoria and in Kosciuszko National Park, New South Wales.

This possum is a Lazarus taxon, and the only living species in the Burramys genus. It is also the only Australian mammal restricted to an alpine habitat. Its prehensile tail, at ~14 cm, is longer than its 11 cm head and body length. Its diet consists of insects, fleshy fruits, nuts, nectar and seeds. 

The mountain pygmy possum was first described as a Pleistocene fossil by Robert Broom in 1896. It was thought to be extinct until 1966, when a living specimen was discovered in a ski-hut on Mount Hotham.

Three geographically isolated populations are known to exist. These populations have been shown to be genetically distinct. For most of the year, males and females live apart from each other. The females live on the better part of the rocky slopes, while the males live on the margins, usually lower on the mountain. In order to breed, the males migrate to the females' habitat. During the ski season on Mount Higginbotham, the males had to cross a road which put their survival in jeopardy. A "Tunnel of Love" was constructed under the road and a road sign was put in place to warn drivers.

Genetic causes for heterochromia include genetic mosaicism, where changes may take place in the dividing cells leading up to iris formation in the embryo. Or, environmental damage may occur to the eyes. Or, various diseases and medical conditions may result in changes in eye colour.

Similar events may happen in other tissues, and sometimes result in visible tissue differences. However, the condition is most easily seen in the iris of the eye. The terms Hetrochromia iridis (= different colour of the iris), Heterochromia iridum (plural form) and Heterochromia iridium (a mistake in Latin grammar) are variously used when it is the eye colour which is specifically mentioned.

[[Bearing (navigation)]]

CATEGORIES: Navigation

In navigation, the word bearing is used for different methods that try to find out the angle between an object used for this purpose, and a reference direction. There are different systems of reference that can be used for this. A system of reference that is commonly used is that of Cardinal directions, as they can be found with a compass. The direction a ship is pointed can also be the reference.

Points that can easily be determined, and that move very little, can be taken as reference. Such points include stars, mountains, the sun, and beacons. Beacons come in the form of lighthouses on the coast, but also as electric beacons or other sea marks on the open sea. 

Bearings can be measured different ways. Optical bearings rely on visual information, other systems rely on radar for tools.

[[Gamophobia]]

CATEGORIES: Phobias

Gamophobia (prounced 'ga-me-PHO-bia', from the Greek 'gamo' meaning 'marriage') is the fear of getting married, being in a relationship, or commitment. The opposite of 'gamophobia' is 'anuptaphobia'-it is the fear of not being in a relationship (to be single or alone). A person who has gamophobia may like or love a person, but when he or she finds out about that person liking them back and attempting to be together, there is a possibility that their affection would change to hate.

Rather than a phobia, such behavior is linked to a number of personality disorders and neuroses. The majority of phobias are socially created, and are not found in any DSM Psychology manual. The inability to allow oneself to  be vulnerable and show their 'bad parts' has a personality disorder. When the individual displays reaction formation (love to hate) this is a neurotic defense mechanism. This can also be known as commitment phobia.

[[Cluny Abbey]]

CATEGORIES: Benedictine abbeys, Buildings and structures in France, Bourgogne-Franche-Comté

Cluney Abbey is a Benedictine abbey in Cluny. It was built in Romanesque style and its three churches date rom the 10th to the 12th century. It was founded by William I of Aquitaine in the year 910. Soon the place was noted because it followed the Rule of St. Benedict more strictly than the place where the rule was developed, that is Subiaco in Italy. Cluny became the leader of a movement called monasticism. The abbey also started the Cluniac Reforms, and was subject only to the pope, Sergius III at the time. The Benedictine order was very important for the stability of f European society at the time.In 1790, during the French Revolution, the abbey was sacked, and mostly destroyed. Today, only very little of the original remains. 

Dating around 1334, the abbots of Cluny had a townhouse in Paris known as the Hôtel de Cluny, what is now a public museum since 1833. Apart from the name, it no longer possesses anything originally connected with Cluny.

[[Irish rebellion of 1798]]

CATEGORIES: History of Ireland, 1798, 1790s in Europe

The Irish rebellion of 1798 was an uprising of Irish people against British rule in Ireland. It was led by Wolfe Tone and consisted primarily of a secret society called the United Irish. It was aided by Republican France. However, it never gained much traction due to its alliance with anti-Catholic France, because Ireland was primarily Catholic. Despite the British government's anti-Catholicism, most Irish Catholics supported the Crown as the lesser of two evils because of the issue of Revolutionary France's involvement. The uprising lasted several months. A group called the United Irishmen were the main driving force in the rebellion. They were influenced by revolutions taking place in America and France around the time. The uprising is also known as United Irishmen Rebellion.

Between 10.000 and 50.000 people died as casualties on the Irish side, between 500 and 2000 on the English side.

[[Volcanic winter]]

CATEGORIES: Weather, Volcanoes, Climate

A volcanic winter is a climate cooling caused by an extremely large volcanic eruption. Such an eruption releases ash and sulfur dioxide in huge quantities. They form aerosols of sulfuric acid. When they reach the stratosphere more sunlight is reflected, and some is absorbed by the stratosphere. These reactions heat up the stratosphere, but lead to a drop in the temperature on the ground.

The Siberian Traps, Emeishan Traps, and Deccan Traps are huge flood basalt provinces caused by volcanism. They are the cause, or part of the cause, of several mass extinctions, especially the Permian–Triassic extinction event.

Nuclear winter is a theory of similar effects which might be caused by a large-scale nuclear war.

4Minute (포미닛) is a five-member South Korean K-pop girl group. Its members are Nam Ji-hyun, Heo Ga-yoon, Jeon Ji-yoon, Kim Hyun-ah and Kwon So-hyun. They belong to Cube Entertainment in Korea. Far Eastern Tribe Records in Universal Music Japan is responsible for 4minute's labels in Japan. Their official fan club name is 4Nia. This is a combination of 4Minute and mania.

They debuted through the M.net M! Countdown on June 18, 2009 with their song "Hot Issue". The name 4minute has two meanings. One means that each of its member will attract audiences in 4 minutes and this is why all of their songs are shorter than 4 minutes. The other meaning is that they will do their best for a minute (for every moment).

Kim Hyun-ah already released two singles. She used to be a member of Wonder Girls and Kwon So-hyun was a member of girl group Orange.  Nam Ji-hyun is best in dance, Heo Ga-yoon in drama, Jeon Ji-yoon in music and Kim Hyun-ah is best in the Department of Theater and Film. 

In December 2010, it released its first Japanese album, Diamond. In 2011, the group released its first Korean full-length album, 4Minutes Left with the title track "Mirror Mirror" and the following years they have promoted 2 more mini albums and 2 chart topping hits "Volume Up" and "What's Your Name"

The group received the Bonsang Award at the 20th Seoul Music Awards, and the Kpop New Artist Award at the 2010 Billboard Japan Music Awards.

The Group disbanded in 2016 after 4 of the 5 members left Cube Entertainment.

In Australia, Ken Park was rated Refused Classification due to content.

[[Cosmic distance ladder]]

CATEGORIES: Astronomical distances

The cosmic distance ladder (also known as the extragalactic distance scale) is the way astronomers measure the distance of objects in space. No one method works for all objects and distances, so astronomers use a number of methods.

A real direct distance measurement of an astronomical object is possible only for those objects that are close enough to Earth (within about a thousand parsecs). It is the larger distances which are the problem. Several methods rely on a standard candle, which is an astronomical object that has a known standard luminosity.

The ladder analogy arises because no one technique can measure distances at all ranges encountered in astronomy. Instead, one method can be used to measure nearby distances, a second can be used to measure nearby to intermediate distances, and so on. Each rung of the ladder provides information that can be used to determine the distances at the next higher rung.

[[V-1 flying bomb]]

CATEGORIES: Explosives, Nazi Germany

The V-1 flying bomb (also called the Buzz Bomb or Doodlebug) was a World War II weapon. It was a flying bomb, an early cruise missile. Its jet engine made it travel at 350 mph (600 kmph).  The Luftwaffe people who controlled it pointed it at London, UK and Antwerp in Belgium. V-1s destroyed nearly as many houses as the Blitz did but killed fewer: 22,892 people died after being attacked by them. The Allies tried to stop these attacks by bombing their launching places, by shooting at them in the air, and by flying fast planes close to them and nudging them off course using their wings.

They had a fairly crude guidance system. Overall, only about 25 per cent of V-1s hit their targets. Most were lost lost by defensive measures, mechanical unreliability or guidance errors.

[[1925 Geneva Protocol]]

CATEGORIES: Treaties and Conventions, 1925, 1920s in Europe, 20th century in Geneva, Chemical warfare, 1920s treaties

The Geneva Protocol of 1925 (The Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or Other Gases, and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare) was a law that made it illegal to fight with chemical or biological weapons in war.  The Geneva protocol was signed on June 17, 1925 and the protocol was entered into force on January 8, 1928. Before, it was signed by some countries like the United Kingdom and France originally. Any country who has signed this Protocol must follow it.

After World War I, the Geneva Protocol was made from the treaties signed with Austria, Hungary and Bulgaria. The use of chemical weapons began in WWI when one million deaths resulted from chemical weapons.

After signing the treaty, some countries wanted to change it so that they would not have to follow it if the country fighting them did not follow the treaty. Because of this, many countries like France and United Kingdom withdrew from it. Others, like the United States still follow it but with this extra condition.

[[Fledge]]

CATEGORIES: Developmental biology, Birds

Fledge is the stage in a young bird's life when the feathers and wing muscles become developed enough for flight. It also describes the act of a chick's parents raising it until it is fully grown. A young bird that has recently fledged but still needs care and feeding is called a  fledgling.

In ornithology, fledging has many meanings, depending on species. Birds are sometimes considered fledged once they leave the nest, even if they still cannot fly.

[[Rat snake]]

CATEGORIES: Colubrids

Rat snakes are medium to large snakes that can be found mostly in the northern hemisphere. They feed primarily on rodents and birds and, with some species being over 3 m (10 feet), they are on the top levels of some food chains.  Many species make attractive pets and one, the corn snake, is one of the most popular reptile pets in the world. Other species can be very sensitive and sometimes aggressive, but the bites are not dangerous. Rat snakes were long thought to be completely nonvenomous, but recent studies have shown that some do have harmlessly small amounts of venom in them. When frightened, rat snakes may freeze, which is why a lot has been killed in traffic.

[[Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry]]

CATEGORIES: Mass spectrometry, Laboratory equipment, Analytical chemistry

Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) is a type of mass spectrometry that is highly sensitive. It can see  a range of metals and several non-metals at concentrations below one part in 1012 (part per trillion). It is based on hooking together an inductively coupled plasma as a method of producing ions (ionization) with a mass spectrometer as a method of separating and detecting the ions. Many chemists use Argon as a carrier gas to make the plasma. The machine sends the sample ions through a series of small cones.  The cones let the plasma ions slowly enter the vacuum chamber of the mass spectrometer.

In trace elemental analysis, the method has advantages of high speed, precision and sensitivity compared to atomic absorption techniques. Analysis of lower concentrations at the same time is more prone to disruption by trace contaminants in labware and reagents used. Some analytes can not work with ICP-MS. Verification of analysis results requires additional work.

The variety of applications exceeds that of ICP-OES and includes isotopic speciation. Because ICP-MS can help make atom bombs, ICP-MS hardware is a subject for special exporting regulations.

[[The Birds of America]]

CATEGORIES: Biology books

The Birds of America is a book by naturalist and painter John James Audubon. It includes illustrations of a wide variety of birds of the United States. It was first published between 1827 and 1838, in Edinburgh and London.

[[4-H]]

CATEGORIES: Agriculture, Education in the United States, Youth organizations

4-H in the United States is a youth organization administered by the National Institute of Food and Agriculture of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), with the mission of "engaging youth to reach their fullest potential while advancing the field of youth development." The name represents four personal development areas for the organization's members: head, heart, hands, and health. The organization has over 6.5 million members in the United States. Members are  five to 19 years old, in approximately 90,000 clubs.

The goal of 4-H is to develop citizenship, leadership, responsibility and life skills of youth through experiential learning programs and a positive youth development approach. Many people think of 4-H as an agriculturally-focused organization as a result of its history. But 4-H today focuses on citizenship, healthy living, science, engineering, and technology programs.

Today, 4-H and related programs exist in over eighty countries around the world. The organization and administration varies from country to country. Each of these programs operates independently. They cooperate in international exchanges, global education programs, and communications.

The 4-H motto is "To make the best better", while its slogan is "Learn by doing" (sometimes written as "Learn to do by doing").

[[Emeishan Traps]]

CATEGORIES: Geography of China, Extinction events, Flood basalts

The Emeishan Traps is a flood basalt volcanic province in Southwestern China, around Sichuan province. Many igneous rock types can be found there. This is known as large igneous province in geology. Other names for the traps include Permian Emeishan Large Igneous Province, and other variations. The Traps are the step-like rock made up of many layers of basalt, which were laid down by successive eruptions of magma. 

The eruptions that lead to the Emeshian traps began about 260 million years ago. The traps are much smaller than the Siberian Traps, which occurred not long afterwards, about 251 million years ago. Despite this, the Emeshian traps were large enough to have an impact on the ecology of the time, and on paleontology. They are part of the mass extinction events towards the end of the Permian period.

The Emeishan Traps are part of the scientific debate on the causes of mass extictions. The end-Guadalupian extinction occurred at almost the same time as the Emeshian Traps were formed. This supports the argument, that volcanism is the main driving force behind mass extinctions. Another theory that has been proposed to explain mass extinctions is that meteor or comet impact events caused them. In this context, the hypothesis is that impact events cause flood basalt eruptions, such as those which generated the Emeshian Traps. This hypothesis is not widely supported.

[[Mucous membrane]]

CATEGORIES: Anatomy

A mucous membrane (or mucosae; singular mucosa) is a skin-like lining. A mucus membrane is covered in epithelium. They secrete mucus, and in the alimentary canal they absorb nutrients. They line cavities that are exposed to the external environment and internal organs. 

At several places they connect up (are contiguous) with the skin. For example, at the nostrils, the mouth, the lips, the eyelids, the ears, the genital area, and the anus. Unlike skin, which has hair growing out of it, mucous membranes are hairless.

The sticky, thick fluid secreted by the mucous membranes and glands is called "mucous". The term mucous membrane refers to where they are found in the body. However, not every mucous membrane secretes mucous.

[[Knob and tube wiring]]

CATEGORIES: Electrical wiring, Construction

Knob and tube wiring (abbreviated K&T) was an early type of electrical wiring. It was commonly used from the 1880s to the early 1940s, and is occasionally, but very rarely, still used today. In knob and tube wiring, wires were held to the wooden structure by ceramic knobs, and were protected by ceramic tubes when they went through a piece of wood. Wires were held to the knobs by another piece of non-conducting wire. A material called loom protected the wire when it entered a junction box, which usually contained an outlet, switch, or light fixture. Splices were soldered together and wrapped in cloth electrical tape. The insulation on knob and tube wiring was usually cotton cloth soaked in asphalt. To prevent short circuits, the hot and neutral wires were kept far apart. This is not necessary on modern wiring because modern insulation alone is enough to prevent short circuits. Knob and tube wiring did not have a ground wire and therefore did not have three-prong outlets. Most electrical codes allow the use of a GFCI to update knob and tube outlets to three-prong without installing any new wire.

[[Exercise physiology]]

CATEGORIES: Physiology, Evolutionary biology, Sports

Exercise physiology is the study of the acute responses and chronic adaptations to a wide-range of physical exercise conditions. In addition, many exercise physiologists study the effect of exercise on pathology, and the mechanisms by which exercise can reduce or reverse disease progression. Professional bodies in most developed countries review and approve education programs to ensuring the quality and consistency of education.

[[Short circuit]]

CATEGORIES: Electricity

A short circuit is a problem in an electrical circuit where two or more wires that are not supposed to come in contact with each other touch.  A short circuit can result in a very high current flowing through the circuit. The high current can destroy components, melt insulation and start a fire. If there is enough voltage, it can also cause an explosion called arc flash. Circuit breakers and fuses are devices that detect short circuits and (usually) shut the power off before any damage can be done.

A "short circuit" also happens when there is a bypass of electrical current. As electricity is "lazy", when there is a bypass without a "load" (e.g. Bulb), it will travel that route of least electrical impedance.

The term "short circuit" is frequently  misused to describe any electrical problem.

[[Circuit breaker]]

CATEGORIES: Electrical wiring

A circuit breaker is a device designed to shut off an electrical circuit when too much current is flowing. This usually occurs if too many devices are plugged in or if there is a short circuit. Circuit breakers are usually installed in the electrical panel. Some circuit breakers also have GFCI protection. Inside the circuit breaker, there is usually an electromagnetic coil. When too much current flows through the coil, it pulls on the switch, shutting the power off. The coil reacts to immediate short circuits. There is also a bimetal strip that will bend and pull on the switch if it gets too hot. This reacts to extended periods of too much current. 

Some advanced circuit breakers monitor current electronically, and shut the power off when an electronic sensor detects too much current. A circuit breaker does the same job as a fuse, but unlike a fuse, a circuit breaker does not need to be replaced to be reset, except in some severe cases such as very high-current short circuits and lightning strikes that may damage the circuit breaker.

[[The Merchant of Venice]]

CATEGORIES: Plays by William Shakespeare

The Merchant of Venice is a play written by William Shakespeare. The date the play was written in unknown, but the play was mentioned in 1598 in Francis Mere's Wit's Treasury. A date of 1596-1597 is now accepted. Shakespeare's source was Il Pecorone by Ser Giovanni, a 14th century  Florentine writer.

[[Eyelid]]

CATEGORIES: Eye

An eyelid is a thin piece of skin that covers and protects the eye. It is one of the thinnest areas of skin on a persons body. A muscle pulls back the eyelid to "open" the eye. People do this willingly or without thinking.  The human eyelid has a row of eyelashes that help protect the eye from dust and other small objects. Eyelashes also keep sweat out of the eye. Eyelids regularly spread tears and other secretions on the surface of the eye to keep it moist. The cornea is one part of the eye that must be kept moist.  Eyelids keep the eyes from drying out when asleep.  Also, the blink reflex protects the eye from things touching it.

[[Dalit]]

CATEGORIES: Discrimination, Society

"Dalit" refers to socially, economically and historically marginalized communities predominantly in India September 2019. It also means "broken/scattered" in Sanskrit and Hindi September 2019. The term dalits was in use as a translation for the British Raj census classification of Depressed Classes prior to 1935. It was popularised by the economist and reformer B. R. Ambedkar (1891–1956), who included all depressed people irrespective of their caste into the definition of dalits. Hence the first group he made was called the "Labour Party" and included as its members all people of the society who were kept depressed, including women, small scale farmers and people from backward castes. 

Dr. Ambedkar fought for a separate electorate for Dalits in Ramsay MacDonald’s Communal Award during British Raj. This award would have ensured adequate representation of Dalit community enabling them to vote for their candidate. 

In 1932, the British Raj recommended separate electorates to select leaders for Dalits in the Communal Award. This was favoured by Ambedkar but when Mahatma Gandhi opposed the proposal it resulted in the Poona Pact. That in turn influenced the Government of India Act, 1935, which introduced the reservation of seats for the Depressed Classes, now renamed as Scheduled Castes. 

Dalit (from Sanskrit ‘dal’ which means to split, to crack, to break) is the name given to a group of people who have been historically considered outcasts in Hindu societies from South Asia (India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Bangladesh)September 2019 and Eastern Africa (Somalia)September 2019. Today, the Dalits, formerly known as “Untouchables”September 2019, have increasingly adopted the term “Dalit” as their way out of the social segregation imposed by the caste system.

New leaders like Kanhaiya Kumar subscribe to this definition of "dalits", thus a Brahmin marginal farmer trying to eke out a living, but unable to do so also falls in the "dalit" category. Ambedkar himself was a Mahar, and in the 1970s the use of the word "dalit" was invigorated when it was adopted by the Dalit Panthers activist group. Gradually, political parties used it to gain mileage.

[[Verdin]]

CATEGORIES: Birds of North America

The Verdin (Auriparus flaviceps) is a small bird. It is the only species in the genus Auriparus, and the only species in the family found in the New World.

The Verdin is a very small bird. At 4.5 inches in length, it rivals the Bushtit as one of the smallest passerines in North America. It is gray overall, and adults have a bright yellow head and rusty "shoulder patch" (the lesser coverts). Unlike the tits, it has a sharply pointed bill.

Verdins are insectivores. They keep looking among the desert trees and scrubs. They usually live alone except when they pair up to make their nests. They are very friendly birds. Verdins occasionally try to get tidbits of dried sugar water from hummingbird feeders.

Verdins always have and will live in southwestern United States and northern Mexico, ranging from southeastern California to Texas, throughout Baja California and into central Mexico, north of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt.

[[Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt]]

CATEGORIES: Volcanic landforms, Volcanoes of Mexico

The Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt (Eje Volcánico Transversal) also known as the Transvolcanic Belt and locally as the Sierra Nevada (Snowy Mountain Range), is a volcanic belt that extends 900 km from west to east across central-southern Mexico. Several of its highest peaks have snow all year long, and during clear weather, they can be seen bythose who live in Mexico on the many high plateaus from which these volcanoes rise.

[[Volcanic belt]]

CATEGORIES: Volcanoes

A volcanic belt is a large volcanically active place.Other terms are used for smaller areas of activity such as volcanic fields. Volcanic belts are found above zones of very high temperature (700-1400°C) where magma is made by melting of rock in the Earth's crust and upper mantle. These areas usually appear along tectonic plate boundaries at depths of 10-50 km.

The biggest volcanic belt is Pacific Ring of Fire

[[Sikhae]]

CATEGORIES: Korean food

Sikhae is a salted fermented food with grains in Korean cuisine as one of jeotgal. Sikhae is made with various fish, such as flat fish, shellfish, pollack, squid and fish intestines, and cooked grains, such as rice, glutinous rice,  glutinous foxtail millet and nonglutinous millet. Sikhae is less salty than jeotgal because most jeotgal is made with seafood and salt, but sikhae is made with not only the ingredients of jeotgal but also grains, shredded radish, etc. Therefore, sikhae is stored for short-term, while jeotgal is able to be stored for rather long-term because of the large amount of salt.

The types of sikhae can be different, depending on the main ingredients, regions, what the family and the person like. In past times, because of the limited transportation, regions near the sea had more types of sikhae compared to the inland areas. Koreans usually eat this food as a banchan (small dishes of food).

[[Diapsid]]

CATEGORIES: Reptiles, Skeletal system

A diapsid is a reptile with two fenestrae (holes) behind the eye on each side of its skull. Most reptiles are diapsids, and the condition does not occur in mammals. The function of the holes is to improve jaw movements, and to reduce the weight of the skull. The holes give places for muscle attachment; also, as jaw muscles contract, the holes allow space for the muscles to bulge.

The Allosaurus skull shows the way the skull became lighter in dinosaurs, especially the large theropods. It is here not much more than a series of struts, yet provides massive bite power.

[[Weapons of World War I]]

CATEGORIES: Firearms

Major advances were made to weapon technology during World War I.  There were better grenades, flame throwers,  poison gas, and artillery. The submarine, warplane and the tank were new weapons. 

Both sides used a much better heavy machine gun than they had used before in Europe. Four to six people worked one. They fired 400 to 600 bullets per minute. The machine guns got too hot and needed water on them. This kind of  gun was invented in 1884 by Hiram Maxim. The German version was the MG08. The British used the Vickers machine gun, which was very safe and easy to use.  The machine guns changed how war went; and killed many soldiers.  Because they sometimes got too hot, they could be slow. In case that one of the crew of the machine gun were shot, the whole squad were trained to fill their spot. As the war progressed, more machine guns were used in trench warfare in combination with barbed wire defensive positions, making them the most deadly weapon on the battle field.

The normal British army rifle was the Lee Enfield 0.303. This was made in 1907 by James Lee. The Lee Enfield could fire twelve bullets per minute. The Germans used the Mauser rifle made in 1898 by Paul Mauser. This was an excellent rifle, but it only held five bullets.

[[Fermilab]]

CATEGORIES: Fermilab, Buildings and structures in Chicago, Illinois

Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab), just outside Batavia, Illinois, near Chicago, is a US Department of Energy national laboratory specializing in high-energy particle physics. As of January 1, 2007, Fermilab is operated by the Fermi Research Alliance, a joint venture of the University of Chicago, Illinois Institute of Technology and the Universities Research Association (URA). Fermilab is a part of the Illinois Technology and Research Corridor.   

Fermilab's Tevatron was a landmark  particle accelerator; at 3.9 in circumference, it was the world's second largest energy particle accelerator (CERN's Large Hadron Collider is 27 km in circumference), until being shut down on September 30, 2011. In 1995, two teams at Fermilab (CDF and DØ, detectors which utilize the Tevatron) announced the discovery of the top quark.

In addition to high energy collider physics, Fermilab is also host to a number of smaller fixed-target and neutrino experiments, such as MiniBooNE (Mini Booster Neutrino Experiment), SciBooNE (SciBar Booster Neutrino Experiment) and MINOS (Main Injector Neutrino Oscillation Search). The MiniBooNE detector is a 40 diameter sphere which contains 800 tons of mineral oil lined with 1520 individual phototube detectors. An estimated 1 million neutrino events are recorded each year.  SciBooNE is the newest neutrino experiment at Fermilab; it sits in the same neutrino beam as MiniBooNE but has fine-grained tracking capabilities. The MINOS experiment uses Fermilab's NuMI (Neutrinos at the Main Injector) beam, which is an intense beam of neutrinos that travels 455 through the Earth to the Soudan Mine in Minnesota.

A large piece of land was reserved for Fermilab, but much of the equipment is underground.  The Fermilab scientists decided to use the land surface as an experiment in restoring Illinois original prairie.  They also started a farm to raise al herd of American bison. The Fermilab Nature Areas is a separate non-profit group that administers these programs.

Asteroid 11998 Fermilab is named in honor of the laboratory.

[[Heterojunction bipolar transistor]]

CATEGORIES: Electronic components

The heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT) is  a type of bipolar junction transistor (BJT) which uses different semiconductor materials for the emitter and base regions, making a heterojunction. The HBT  can handle signals of much higher frequencies, (up to several hundred GHz) than BJT. HBT is commonly used in modern ultrafast circuits, mostly radio-frequency (RF) systems, and in applications requiring a high power efficiency, such as RF power amplifiers in mobile  phones. The idea of using a heterojunction is as old as the conventional BJT, dating back to a patent from 1951.

[[Korean Canadian]]

CATEGORIES: Ethnic groups in Canada, Korean people, Canadian people

Korean Canadians are Canadians of Korean descent. According to South Korea's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, there are 223,322 Koreans or people of Korean ancestry in Canada. This is the fourth-largest population of Koreans outside of Korea (after Koreans in Japan and ahead of Koreans in Russia). Also, the government of South Korean guessed that there are more than 100,000 Koreans living in Canada illegally.

==History==  

The first Koreans who came to Canada were Christians. They were sent by Canadian missionaries to study Christianity in Canada. Not many stayed in Canada though; and in 1965, the total Korean population of Canada was only about 70 people. However, after 1966's change of Canadian immigration laws, South Korean immigration to Canada grew. Between 1970 and 1980, 18,148 Koreans immigrated to Canada, and another 17,583 came in the 1990s. In the late 1990s, South Korea became the fifth-largest source of immigrants to Canada. Toronto has the most Koreans in Canada, but Vancouver has the highest growth rate of Koreans. They have increased 69% since 1996. Montreal has the third-most Korean immigrants at this time. In 2001, More Koreans went to Canada than to the United States. The number of temporary residents also grew after the Canadian government made visas not necessary; South Korea sent the most international students to Canada in the late 1990s. Many of the Koreans who came to Canada, came from the Korean population in China.

In the 1990s, many Koreans came to Canada because unemployment was high and income growth was low. It was the opposite in the United States at this time. They also came because the Canadian dollar was very weak, so they could get a lot of Canadian money from their Korean money. In the USA, they could get less American dollars. So they had more money if they came to Canada Lastly, in Korea at the time there was lots of anti-American feelings, and also many local native teachers came from Canada, so Koreans knew Canadians very well. .

[[Placodont]]

CATEGORIES: Sauropterygia, Marine reptiles

Placodonts were a group of Triassic marine reptiles which had heavy flat teeth. These teeth were used for crushing shellfish. Placodonts are in the Order Sauropterygia, the group that includes Plesiosaurs. Placodonts were mostly between 1 in length, up to a maximum 3 long. They are found in marine sediments of the Middle and Upper Triassic, 235–250 million years ago.

The first specimen was discovered in 1830, and the group was very widely distributed. Shellfish were common throughout the Mesozoic period, but this group of shellfish-eaters went extinct at the end of the Triassic. They were clearly a victim of some event which disturbed their lifestyle. The end-Triassic had several extinction events which are not well understood.

[[Queen Seondeok of Silla]]

CATEGORIES: 606 births, 647 deaths, Kings and queens, Korean monarchs

Queen Seondeok of Silla (606 – 8 January 647) was 27th ruler of Silla, one of the three ancient kingdoms of Korea. She was a daughter of King Jinpyeong and Lady Maya of the Kim clan. Because King Jinpyeong did not have any sons, Queen Seondeok became the first female ruler in Korean history after her father died. Besides the name Seondeok, she was also called Sung-Jo Hwang-Go which means "sacred and dedicated queen".

Queen Seondeok was an intelligent and capable ruler who established the foundation of Silla's unity of Korea peninsula. She ruled her kingdom wisely and improved her people’s life. Also, she made a lot of effort to accept advanced culture of ancient China by sending international students and monks. The star-gazing tower named Cheomseongdae and wooden tower with nine floors in Hwangnyongsa temple are the results of her effort.

According to some legend (in Korean history book Samguk Sagi) related to her, Queen Seondeok had great intuition and foresight. She noticed where the enemy was hiding by natural phenomena, predicted many incidents before it happened, and even knew when she would die a couple of days ago and left her will before death. Because of her extraordinary and heroic life, many Korean people make novels, plays, musicals and so on till now.

[[Pachypleurosaur]]

CATEGORIES: Sauropterygia, Marine reptiles

Pachypleurosaurs were primitive sauropterygian reptiles that vaguely resembled aquatic lizards, and were limited to the Triassic period.  They were long animals, ranging in size from 20 cm to about four metres in length, with small heads, long necks, paddle-like limbs, and long deep tails.  The limb girdles are greatly reduced, so it is unlikely these animals could move about on land.  The widely spaced peg-like teeth project at the front of the jaws, indicate that these animals fed on fish.

Pachypleurosaurs are usually included among the Nothosaurs.

[[Stiff-tailed duck]]

CATEGORIES: Ducks

The stiff-tailed ducks are part of the Oxyurinae subfamily of ducks. All have, as their name implies, long stiff tail feathers, which are erect when the bird is at rest. All have relatively large swollen bills.

These are freshwater diving ducks. Their legs are set far back, making them awkward on land, so they rarely leave the water.

Their unusual displays involve drumming noises from inflatable throat-sacs, head throwing, and erecting short crest.

Feather sequences are complicated, and it is hard to tell how old one of these ducks is. Feathers are vital for survival because of this animals tendency to spend time in the water. Without feathers this duck would die of hypothermia because it could not regulate its body temperature.

[[Inland sea]]

CATEGORIES: Seas

Inland seas, also called epeiric or epicontinental seas, are shallow seas over part of a continent.

They usually happen with marine transgressions, when the sea overtops the land. They are caused by either global high ('eustatic') sea level or the formation of large geologic basins which eventually connect to the ocean.

There have been, at some periods, shallow seas inside continents. Much of present-day North America was covered by an epicontinental sea called the Sundance Sea during the Jurassic period. In the Cretaceous an even larger area was covered by the Western Interior Seaway. A modern example is the Baltic Sea. The North Sea is not an inland sea, but it does sit on continental shelf, and so is epeiric (that is what the word means). The Hudson Bay is often considered an epeiric sea because its depth averages 100ft (30 m) whereas, for example, the Bay of Bengal is 2,600 metres (8000 ft) deep. So epeiric seas are on the continental plate, as are inland seas. The inland seas, however, are more enclosed.

[[Fuse]]

CATEGORIES: Electrical wiring, Electronic components

A fuse is a device that shuts off the power to an electrical circuit when too much electric current flows through it.  This usually happens when too many appliances are plugged in or when there is a short circuit. A fuse is made as an intentional weak spot in a circuit that will melt (or "blow") when too much current is flowing through it, shutting off the power to the rest of the circuit. This protects the rest of the circuit. After the fuse blows, the problem that caused it to blow must be corrected and the fuse must be replaced to restore power to the circuit. A circuit breaker does the same job as a fuse, but it can be reset without replacing anything.

Fuses in plugs are made in standard ratings. The most common are 3 A, 5 A and 13 A. The fuse should be rated at a slightly higher current than the device needs. e.g. if the device works a 3 A use 5 A fuse. Fast and slow fuses are made. Fast acting fuses blow immediately once the current rating is exceeded. Slow blow fuses will let the current exceed the rating for a fraction of a second, to allow devices like motors to start up.

The Arrondissement of Bayeux is an arrondissement of France. It is in the Calvados département, in the Basse-Normandie region. It has 6 cantons and 126 communes.

[[Abugida]]

CATEGORIES: Writing systems

An abugida is a writing system that is neither a syllabic nor alphabetic script, but somewhere in between. It has sequences of consonants and vowels that are written as a unit, each based on the consonant letter. Vowels must be written down as well, but they are secondary.

Syllables are built up of consonants, each of which has an inherent vowel, which means a vowel is assumed to be pronounced in a syllable even if it is not written down. For example, in Thai, the syllable written as the consonant-vowel pair หา is pronounced hā, but the syllable just written as a consonant ห is pronounced hɔ.

Diacritic symbols are used to change or mute the inherent vowel, and separate vowel letters may be used when vowels occur at the beginning of a syllable or on their own.

In some abugidas, certain vowels can be written to the right, to the left, on top, or below the consonant that is spoken before it, even if the reading order of the consonants must all be left-to-right or right-to-left. An example of this will use the Thai consonant ก to show where the following vowels must be written.

This is different from a truly alphabetic script, in which the vowels and consonants have the same status, and an abjad, whose vowels are left out. Ethiopic, most scripts of the Indian subcontinent, Mainland Southeast Asia, and some scripts of Maritime Southeast Asia, and Canadian syllabics are abugidas.

Some forms of shorthand also employ diacritics to indicate vowels.

The name 'abugida' is derived from the first four letters of the Ge'ez (Ethiopic) alphasyllabary writing system.

CATEGORIES: Villages in Illinois, Fermilab, 1960s establishments in Illinois, Unknown disestablishments

Weston, Illinois was a community next to Batavia. It was a subdivision of pre-fabricated homes started in the early 1960s.  Sales were very slow, so the land developers tried to attract Fermilab to be a new employer on the edge of the new town.  However, it turned out that the amount of land needed would swallow up the entire town.  So, the town voted to sell all of the land, including the houses that had been built to Fermilab.  The people wanted to move the town to the east beyond the edge of Fermilab, but county officials prohibited the move. The town then dissolved.

Before new Fermilab buildings could be finished, the scientists moved into the Weston houses and also moved all of the farm houses on Fermilab to that location for use as office space. They renamed Weston, "Fermilab Village." It still houses visiting scientists.

[[Direct proof]]

CATEGORIES: Mathematics, Logic

A direct proof is a way of showing that something is true or false by using logic. This is done by combining known facts. No assumptions are made when doing a direct proof. Lemmas and theorems are used to prove direct proofs.

A statement that can be proved with a direct proof is usually in the form "if p, then q." Here, p and q are facts. To solve a statement like this, every case where p is true must be considered.

For example, this statement can be solved with a direct proof: "if x and y are even integers, then x+y is an even integer." Since x and y are even, then we can say that x=2m and y=2n, where m and n are integers. (This is a lemma.) We can also say that m+n is an integer, because adding two integers gives an integer. (This is another lemma.) Then we can say that x+y=2m+2n=2(m+n). Since m+n is an integer, we can say 2(m+n)=2k, where k=m+n. We know that any integer times 2 is an even integer. We can then say that any two even integers added together give an even integer.

Direct proofs are used in mathematics, logic, and computer science. The opposite of a direct proof is an indirect proof (also called a proof by contradiction.)

The objects are now in the British Museum in London, where the most important pieces and a selection of the rest are on permanent display. In 1993, the Treasure Valuation Committee valued the hoard at £1.75 million (today £UK).

The hoard was buried as an oak box or small chest filled with items in precious metal, with some in smaller wooden boxes and others in bags or wrapped in fabric. Remnants of the chest, and of fittings such as hinges and locks, were recovered in the dig. The coins date the hoard to after AD 407, about the end of Britain as a Roman province.

The owners and reasons for burial of the hoard are unknown, but it was carefully packed and the contents seem what a very rich family might have owned. The lack of large silver serving vessels and of some of the most common types of jewellery, suggest that the hoard is only part of the wealth of its owner.

The Hoxne treasure contains several rare and important objects, including a gold body-chain and silver-gilt pepper-pots. The hoard was excavated by archaeologists with the items largely undisturbed and intact. The find has helped to improve the relationship between people using metal detectors and archaeologists. It has influenced a change in English law on finds of treasure.p173

[[Tōhoku region]]

CATEGORIES: Geography of Japan, Honshu

The Tōhoku region is one of Japan's traditional regions. The Japanese conventions of geography and history divide the nation into eight regions, including the Tōhoku region.  These have been used since 1905 as basic units for description and comparison and as cultural markers.

The regions of Japan are a fusion of historical divisions and modern administrative needs.    The significance of the region in Japan is geographical, cultural and administrative.

[[Euro disco]]

CATEGORIES: Disco, Pop music, Dance music, Electronic dance music

Euro disco is a form of disco-based dance music which originated in the late-1970s in Europe, as a more European variant of disco music. Euro disco was based on disco music, yet it was a more encompassing genre which borrowed influences from pop, rock and New Wave music. In such a way, it was more pop-friendly and less "gritty" than regular disco music. It often included synthesizers within its composition.

Euro disco, as the term suggests, was popular in Europe. Nevertheless, it also achieved popularity in the United States through artists such as Donna Summer. Some regard Kraftwerk as the first Euro disco group. Furthermore,  Giorgio Moroder was also a major force within the Euro disco scene.

[[Woodpecker Finch]]

CATEGORIES: Finches, Galápagos Islands

The Woodpecker Finch is a species of birds in the family Fringillidae. They live in the Galapagos Islands and are named for their habit of eating grubs that live in the woods. But the woodpecker finch, unlike woodpeckers, does not have a long tongue or a bill that is suitable for getting hold of the grubs. Instead, it uses a cactus spine or twig that is the right shape to dig grubs out. 

[[Secretarybird]]

CATEGORIES: Accipitriformes

The secretarybird (Sagittarius serpentarius) is a large terrestrial bird of prey. It is usually found in African savannas and open grasslands.

Unlike most birds of prey, the secretarybird hunts its prey on foot. Adults hunt in pairs and sometimes as family flocks. They stalk through the grass with long strides. Prey includes insects, mammals from mice to hares and mongoose, crabs, lizards, snakes, tortoises, young birds, bird eggs, and sometimes dead animals killed in grass or bushfires.

The bird is famous for hunting snakes. It even hunts venomous cobras and other reptiles. Its claws are weak and blunt, so to make a kill, it stomps on its victim, breaking its back.

It is put in its own family on the basis of molecular sequence analysis.

[[Nucleophile]]

CATEGORIES: Physical organic chemistry

A nucleophile is a species that donates an electron-pair to an electrophile to form a chemical bond in a reaction. All molecules or ions with a free pair of electrons can be nucleophiles. This pair of electrons is called lone pair. Because nucleophiles donate electrons, they fit the definition of Lewis bases. 

Nucleophilic describes the attraction of a nucleophile to the nuclei. Nucleophilicity, sometimes referred to as  nucleophile strength, refers to a substance's nucleophilic character and is often used to compare the attraction of atoms.

Neutral nucleophilic reactions with solvents such as alcohols and water are called "solvolysis". Nucleophiles may take part in nucleophilic substitution reactions. In those reactions, a nucleophile becomes attracted to a full or partial positive charge.

[[Camposaurus]]

CATEGORIES: Theropods, Triassic dinosaurs

Camposaurus is a dinosaur from the Late Triassic of North America. It is a relative of Coelophysis. This relationship was upheld by a recent phylogenetic anlysis.

With fossils dating back to 205–210 million years ago (mya), it is the oldest known neotheropod. It is known from partial lower leg bones and other fragmentary material. 

A study of Camposaurus arizoniensis by Ezcurra and Brusatte discovered two unique features. This meant the specimen was a valid genus and species. Camposaurus is definitely a neotheropod. Based on phylogenetic analysis, its closest known relative is Megapnosaurus rhodensis, because they share similarities in the tibia, and ankle. Spielman et al. (2007) put Camposaurus in the family Coelophysidae.

[[Staurikosaurus]]

CATEGORIES: Triassic dinosaurs, Dinosaurs of South America, Theropods

Staurikosaurus is a genus of Upper Triassic theropod dinosaurs found in Brazil. It was a small, lightly built carnivore.

The rarity of Staurikosaurus remains may be a result of it being uncommon while alive, or because it lived in an environment such as a forest, where fossils rarely form.

[[Voting age]]

CATEGORIES: Voting

Voting age is the age when a person is allowed to vote in political elections by governments. The majority of countries set it at 18, but ages ranging from 16 to 21 exist. Iran is the only sovereignty to ever have a voting age below 16 in recent history, setting it at 15 until it was raised to 18 recently. When the voting age was first established it was usually set at 21, but in the latter half of the twentieth century most countries, including the United States, lowered it to 18. A few jurisdictions today, such as Austria and the Isle of Man, have lowered it to 16.

[[American Vampire]]

CATEGORIES: Comic books, 2010 books, Books by Stephen King

American Vampire is an Eisner Award-winning comic book series. It was created by writer Scott Snyder and Rafael Albuquerque.

In the series, the vampire population is made up of many different species. Most people do not know vampires exist. The series  shows how vampires evolve and deal with conflict between the species throughout history. The series is mostly about a new American species of vampires. This group was born American West in the late 1800s. The first of this new species is an outlaw named Skinner Sweet. After becoming a vampire, Sweet leans that he is a new kind of vampire. He is stronger and faster than other species. Sunlight does not hurt him. He has new strengths. He also has different weaknesses. The series shows his movements through several decades of American history. It also follows the only vampire he is known to have created, Pearl Jones. Jones is a young woman who was trying to work as an actress in the 1920s silent film industry. She was attacked by a group of European vampires who were hiding in Hollywood. Sweet saved her by giving her his blood. This turned her into an American vampire like him. After this, tried to get revenge on the vampires who attacked her. The relationship between Jones and Sweet is an important part of the series.

The first five issues had two stories in each issue. One story was by Snyder and the other by Stephen King. Both stories were drawn by Rafael Albuquerque. As of the sixth issue, Scott Snyder became the only writer. In its second year of publication, a spin-off mini-series was created. It was titled American Vampire: Survival of the Fittest. This mini-series was drawn by Sean Murphy. It is about a vampire-hunting organization from the main series.

[[Basal]]

CATEGORIES: Evolutionary biology, Taxonomy

Basal is a term in biology for 'primitive' or 'ancestral'. Basal is preferred because it is neutral and non-judgmental. This terminology came into use with cladistics. The term is used in evolution and classification to mean the group which gave rise to later forms. It is a term which works at any level: a basal species gives rise to derived species, and a basal group gives rise to derived groups.

Derived is the correct term in biology for specialised or advanced. It is used for groups which have evolved from a more basal group. A derived trait is a trait that is present in an organism, but was not in the last common ancestor of the group being considered. Simplicity is often secondarily derived. For example, no mitochondria in the anaerobic protist Entamoeba histolytica is a result of their secondary loss.

In the last example, note that apes are derived from monkeys but basal with respect to our own genus. The status of being basal or derived is relative, though living species can only be derived. In any basal-derived pair, the basal member must have evolved before the derived member, with evidence that some of its species gave rise to (evolved into) the derived member.

[[Electronic dance music]]

CATEGORIES: Electronic dance music

Electronic dance music, often simplified as EDM, (occasionally referred to as electronica or dance) is a form of electronic music which is meant to be danced to, often in the setting of a nightclub, discothèque or party. Generally, electronic dance music is created by producers and composers, and is then used by DJs, or disc jockeys, in the above settings. Electronic dance music takes many forms and styles. As a genre, it is generally up-tempo music created by electronic software and machines, such as synthesizers, drum machines, keyboards, samplers, sequencers and computers. Occasionally, the term "techno" is used to describe electronic dance music in general, despite being a generalisation as techno is a distinguishable subgenre of EDM.

[[E pluribus unum]]

CATEGORIES: Latin phrases, Mottos of the United States

"E pluribus unum" is a traditional motto of the United States. It means "out of many, one" in Latin. It has been placed on the U.S. dollar bill, and other related items.

The motto was suggested by the first Great Seal committee in 1776. Consultant and artist Pierre Du Simitière chose the Latin motto, and his design expresses this theme.

This motto was well known to literate Americans of the 18th century. It had appeared in the Gentleman's Magazine, published monthly in London since 1731, with copies reaching the colonies. The legend "E pluribus unum" was used on the title pages of the magazine's annual complication volumes.

In Thomson's 1782 sketch, for the final design, Charles Thomson put this motto on a scroll held in the bald eagle's beak.

"E pluribus unum" is a clear reference to the Thirteen Colonies united into one nation – symbolized by the shield on the eagle's breast. As explained in the official description of the Great Seal, the thirteen vertical stripes "represent the several states all joined in one solid compact entire, supporting a Chief, which unites the whole & represents Congress. The Motto alludes to this union."

[[An Outcast of the Islands]]

CATEGORIES: 1896 books, Novels, Works by Joseph Conrad

An Outcast of the Islands is the second novel by Joseph Conrad. It was published in 1896. It was based on Conrad's experience working on a steamer (ship), the Vigar.

The novel tells about the fall of Peter Willems. He is a bad man, and has a bad reputation. On the run from a scandal in Makassar, he finds a place to hide in a hidden native village. However, he betrays the people who are helping him, because of lust for the tribal chief's daughter. The story features the character Tom Lingard, who Conrad uses lots, and also appears in Almayer's Folly (1895) and The Rescue (1920). It shares other characters with those novels.

This novel was made into a movie in 1952 by director Carol Reed, starring Trevor Howard as Willems, Ralph Richardson as Lingard, Robert Morley, and Wendy Hiller.

The work was quoted in T. S. Eliot's The Hollow Men: "Life is very long.".

[[Scipionyx]]

CATEGORIES: Cretaceous dinosaurs, Dinosaurs of Europe, Coelurosaurs

Scipionyx samniticus is one of the most important recent dinosaur finds. It is a tiny theropod (meat-eater) fossil found in Cretaceous limestone in southern Italy near Naples. Although it was unearthed thirty years ago in 1981, its true importance was not realized until 1994. It is a very important specimen in that it has fossilized remains of many of its internal organs and muscles. This type of detail is rare in fossils since the soft tissues from an animal do not usually fossilize; they almost always rot before mineral replacement can take place. This new fossil will yield a lot of information about dinosaurs' anatomy and physiology as it is studied.

The fossil is a theropod, perhaps a compsognathid (related to Compsognathus). It is a hatchling 9.5 inches (24 cm) long. It is from 113 million years ago (during the Cretaceous period) and has been named Scipionyx samniticus. During the Cretaceous period it lived near a shallow lagoon.

The Battle of Messines was a battle which happened in the Western front of the First World War. It began on 7 June 1917 when the British Second Army, which was commanded by General Herbert Plumer, attacked near the village of Mesen (Messines) in West Flanders, Belgium. The attack was meant to capture a ridge which ran north from Messines village, past Wytschaete village. This ridge was a natural place where  you could keep safe southeast of Ypres. One thing which happened during the battle which was unusual was that 19 mines were set off just before the infantry attack. This was a tactic which made German defences disorganised. This allowed the troops to do what they were supposed to do very quickly. The attack also came before the much larger battle, the Third Battle of Ypres, usually known as Passchendaele, which began on 31 July 1917.

[[Döbereiner's lamp]]

CATEGORIES: Fire, Light

Döbereiner's lamp is one of the first lighters. It was developed in 1823 by the German chemist Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner. The lighter was produced until around 1880. The Heidelberg Castle and also the Deutsches Museum (German Museum) still have original Döbereiner lamps to show.

The lighter works based on a chemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen. In the glass cylinder (a in the picture on the right) is sulfuric acid. In the open bottle (b) is zinc and at the top is a valve. With the lever (f), the bottle will be opened. Then, the sulfuric acid flows into the bottle. When it reaches the Zinc, a reaction starts. It produces hydrogen.

The hydrogen can go out of the bottle at the top. Next to the valve, there is platinum. The hydrogen gas has to bypass the platinum. The hydrogen and the oxygen from the air react because of the catalytic effect of platinum. The gas mixture (called oxyhydrogen) then burns, because the reaction is exothermic, and produces water.

To stop this reaction, the bottle only needs to be closed, that means the lever needs to be released. The hydrogen can no longer go out of the bottle and pushes the sulfuric acid back into the glass cylinder.

[[WYSIWYM]]

CATEGORIES: Web design, Acronyms

WYSIWYM is an acronym that stands for What you see is what you mean.  This was positioned to not be confused with WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get). The idea behind WYSIWYM is to display text on screen in much the same way as they will appear when printed on paper. WYSIWYM is different from this: The content is structured. When the content is entered, this meaning is added to the text. This will mean that presentation is separated from the content. The content is translated before it is rendered. This also means that it can be translated differently, the same content can lead to different output formats. More importantly though, the person editing the document can focus on the content, and is not easily distracted by what the content looks like. One of the drawbacks of the method is that the user is forced to think ahead. LaTeX is an example of a document processing system that uses WYSIWYM.

[[Phantom island]]

CATEGORIES: Phantom islands

A phantom island is an island that was thought to exist at some point in time. Because of this, the island was shown on a map. Later, the islands were removed from maps. Some islands are described and later on change their name, or with the description given it is possible to associate a real island. Other islands sink below sea level because of natural causes such as erosion. Such islands still exist. Two examples are Earnest Legouve Reef and Maria-Theresa Reef in the South Pacific. Because they are far away from ships' routes, their existence can not be proved so far. In the year 1908, Robert Peary claimed to have found a lost continent, called Crocker Land. 

People such as João Vaz Corte-Real were rewarded for finding islands that turned out to be phantom islands. In the case given, the phantom island was Bacalao. The island showed up on maps in the early 16th century. Baccalieu Island is probably named after the phantom island.

Some phantom islands were later found. That way Baja California was first thought to be an island. Later, people found it was in fact a peninsula. Thule was discovered in antiquity; in modern times, people who found it may have talked about Norway, the Orkney Islands, Shetland or Scandinavia. Other interpretations include Iceland, Greenland, or the island Saaremaa in the Baltic Sea.

Other phantom islands may exist because of mistakes in navigation, or optical illusions, such as superior mirage. One example of this is New South Greenland, which was observed in the Weddell Sea in 1823, and has not been seen since. 

Some phantom islands may have existed, but they have been destroyed, or are no longer above the water line. These include Thompson Island in the South Atlantic, and Bermeja, off the coast of Yucatán.

[[Aerogel]]

CATEGORIES: Materials, Insulation

Aerogel is a gel in which the liquid part has been replaced with a gas (usually air). It was invented in 1931 by Samuel Stephens Kistler. The most common type of aerogel is silica aerogel, which is made from the same molecule as glass. It is a solid material that is almost as light as air. It is the world's lightest material. Its melting point is 1200 degrees Celsius, which is comparable to crocidolite asbestos. Aerogel is the best thermal insulator available and can be used in construction in place of fiberglass insulation. It allows better insulation with less material, although it is much more expensive than fiberglass. It is also brittle, making it more difficult to install than fiberglass. Most aerogel is not water-resistant, and even small amounts of water can destroy it. It is also safer than fiberglass or asbestos because it is not known to cause cancer if inhaled into the lungs. Some aerogel insulation, however, contains fiberglass to increase its flexibility.

[[Crocker Land]]

CATEGORIES: Phantom islands

Crocker Land is the name for a supposed eighth continent in the Arctic Ocean. In the year 1906, Robert Peary thought he had seen a landmass, which he named after George Crocker, a member of Peary Arctic Club. He thought that the land was about 130 miles (210 km) north of Ellesmere Island, at 83 degrees north and 100 degrees west. 

In 1913, the Crocker Land expedition started, to find Crocker Land. This expedition turned out to be a failure. The captain of the first ship became drunk and ran aground on the rocks. Later an Inuit guide was deliberately shot and killed by one of the expedition members under suspicious circumstances. The expedition eventually became stranded and was not rescued until four years later.

The MacGregor Arctic Expedition in 1937–1938 also took aerial photographs. These show that there is no land at that location. Despite this, some pseudo-scientific organizations still try to present a case for its possible existence.

The expedition did not find Crocker Land. Later, satellite images showed that the continent did not exist, and could not be found. Today, it is believed that what Peary saw, was a fata morgana mirage.

[[Bradley Land]]

CATEGORIES: Phantom islands

Bradley Land is the name of a landmass Frederick Cook claimed to have seen during a expedition in 1909. He said, the land between positions  (84) and (85). He described it as two masses of land with a break, a strait, or an indentation between. The land was named for John R. Bradley, who had sponsored Cook's expedition.

Cook published two photographs of the land and described it as follows: "The lower coast resembled Heiberg Island, with mountains and high valleys. The upper coast I estimated as being about one thousand feet high, flat, and covered with a thin sheet ice." 

It is now known there is no land at that location. Cook's observations were based on either a misidentification of sea ice or an outright fabrication.  Cook's Inuit companions reported that the photographs were actually taken near the coast of Axel Heiberg Island.

[[Thompson Island (South Atlantic)]]

CATEGORIES: Phantom islands

Thompson Island is a phantom island, in the South Atlantic. It was thought to be about 150 km north-northeast of Bouvet Island. 

Jean-Baptiste Charles Bouvet de Lozier discovered Bouvet Island in 1739. In 1808, James Lindsay of the Snow Swan discovered Bouvet Island again, and named it Lindsay Island. The next time, George Norris of the Sprightly sighted Bouvet on 10 December 1825. He landed on 16 December, and took possession of the island, which he named Liverpool Island, for King George IV of the United Kingdom.

Between December 13 and December 16, Norris sailed the waters northeast of Bouvet Island, where he discovered another island. It was much smaller, and the sea around it was much rougher. Three miles southeast of the newly discovered island, he found three rocks. In his log, he named the newly found island Thompson Island, and the rocks chimneys, because of their form. He also marked the position of his discoveries on a map. Unfortunately, the positions of the islands on the map did not match those written down in the log. In 1853 the discoveries of Thompson Island, Bouvet Island, and the Chimneys showed up on an official map of the British admiralty. 

In 1893, Captain Joseph J. Fuller reported another sighting of Thompson Island, on his ship, Francis Allyn.

The Valdivia expedition wanted to find the exact position of Bouvet and Thompson Island, in November 1898, but was unable to find Thompson Island.

In 1915, a German ship, the Meteor, gave a depth of the sea of 1579 m at the position where Thompson had been reported. If Thompson ever existed, it is probable that it disappeared in a volcanic eruption sometime in the 1890s.

The Norwegian Arctic Expedition (1928/29) failed to find Thompson Island, and declared it did not exist.

Thompson Island continued to appear on maps published as late as 1943.

The only person to have seen Thompson Island was probably Norris. Fuller's description of Thompson Island matches more or less that given of Bouvet Island in Norris' diary, and is therefore questionable.

[[GIS]]

CATEGORIES: Acronyms, Branches of geography

GIS may stand for Geographic Information Sciences or for Geographic Information System. These are two different but related things in geography. The Geographic Information Sciences include many fields of knowledge that help to understand geographic information while a Geographic Information System is a system designed to capture, store, manipulate, analyze, manage, and present all types of spatial or geographical data and allow for the study of "layers" of geographic information.

GIS also known as geographic information system is a computer system made for capturing and displaying positions on the earth’s surface and portraying data in many different ways on maps.  Its main job is to help in analyzing groups of data and in finding correlations or patterns.  For example a map could use GIS to find out the amount of rubbish in one area, and also include how many factories and types of factories are in that area.

GIS can store information about a location and help provide knowledge on many different topics in a location.  Users can specify a place via latitude and longitude, postal code or address.  Then GIS can provide information about the people in that area including: income, population and education levels.  It can also tell about physical things such as soil types, vegetation, water sources, manmade structures like buildings and roads.

[[First Boer War]]

CATEGORIES: Wars involving the British Empire, 19th century in South Africa, Boer Wars

In the 19th Century Scramble for Africa, the British Empire tried to control all of southern Africa. They won control of the Cape of Good Hope in 1815 at the end of the Napoleonic Wars. Many Boers (Dutch, German and French farmers) did not like Britain controlling the area. The British taxed them, made English the official language, and in 1834 abolished slavery. Some of the Boers moved north in the Great Trek and made a new country called the Orange Free State. In 1877 the British Army moved in to control the Orange Free State in pursuit of diamonds, one of the Orange Free State's rich natural resources. On 16 December 1880 the First Boer War began. It took ten weeks in 1880 and 1881. The British were defeated.

From 1896 to 1899 Governor of the Cape and High Commissioner for South Africa, Alfred Milner made preparations for another war in order to gain the wealth of the Orange Free State and in September 1899 British troops arrived in South Africa. Paul Kruger president of the Transvaal sent Britain an ultimatum asking strongly for their departure.

Boer farmers from Sandspruit, Volksrust, the Orange Free State, and the Transvaal fought in the war. As the Boers lost men in battle they recruited young boys and old men to fight. Black people also fought alongside the Boers in the war and they made up 20 to 25 percent of total Boer manpower. The German Empire was friendly to their cause, and the Boers used Krupp guns. Much of the fighting was on  horseback. As the Boers lost battle after battle they were eventually forced to make peace on the 23rd of March, 1902, and surrender to British authority.

[[Sonar]]

CATEGORIES: Machines, Wave physics

Sonar is a machine that uses underwater sound waves to find other objects in the sea. A sonar can work by sending out sound and listening for echoes (active sonar), like a radar, or by listening for sound made by the object it is trying to find (passive sonar).

The basic parts of an active sonar are:

The first use of passive sonar was in 1490 by Leonardo da Vinci, when he put a tube onto water and listened. Active sonar was first used in 1917 by Paul Langevin. The word SONAR was created during the Second World War as an acronym for Sound Navigation and Ranging. This acronym replaced the British acronym ASDIC. The word is now thought by many people as a regular word, no longer as an acronym.

[[Rococo]]

CATEGORIES: Art, Architectural styles, French culture, 18th century in France

Rococo is an artistic style which originated in the 18th century in France. Often referred to merely as Late Baroque, the Rococo developed from the Baroque artistic movement. Whilst it kept several characteristics of the original style, including elaboration and ornate themes, it was also more playful and asymmetrical. The Rococo is associated with the reign of French king Louis XV (Louis XIV is associated with the Baroque, whilst Louis XVI with Neoclassicism, albeit his style started off as Rococo at the beginning of reign). Rococo's popularity was at its height towards the middle of the 18th century, fading out by the end in favour of Neoclassicism.

Rococo art and architecture was feminine, graceful, florid and ornate. Creamy and pastel-like colours were used for paintings, unlike the darker shades in Baroque art. Religion and politics were no longer necessarily the core theme of Rococo art, unlike the Baroque, and everyday life became more commonly represented. In such a way, Rococo art revolved around themes such as love, romance, fun, landscapes, and mere portraits. Additionally, Far Eastern themes became popular in Rococo, especially Chinoiserie. Famous Rococo artists include Boucher, Watteau and Fragonard, amongst several others.

The Rococo has been the focus of much discussion, analysis and criticism by art historians throughout history. It has been criticised over the years for being over-the-top, superficial and frivolous; in such a way, the term has even been used derogatively in various points of history. Nevertheless, Rococo art and theatre has also received praise for the elegance, "beauty", and "charm" of its artwork.

[[Azerbaijani food]]

CATEGORIES: Azerbaijani food, Foods by nationality, Azerbaijani culture

Azerbaijani food is what people cook and eat in Azerbaijan. Foods from different cultures have influenced Azerbaijani food. However, it remained different from foods in other countries. Many foods that started in Azerbaijan are now part of other cultures. For the Azerbaijanis, food is an important part of the country's culture and is very connected with the history, traditions and values of the nation.

Out of 11 climate types in the world, Azerbaijan has nine. This adds to the fertility of the soil, so there are many kinds of vegetables used according to seasons and the dishes. The climate helps to create the richness of the food. Fresh herbs, including mint, coriander, dill, basil, parsley, tarragon, leek, chive, thyme, marjoram, green onion and watercress, are very popular and are often put in the main dishes. The Caspian Sea has many edible species of fish, including the sturgeon, Caspian salmon, kutum, sardines, grey mullet, and others. Black caviar from the Caspian Sea is one of Azerbaijan’s best known delicacies wanted in many parts of the world.

The main courses of Azerbaijani cuisine are over 30 kinds of soups, including those prepared from plain yogurt. One of the most famous dishes is plov. Plov is a saffron-covered rice, served with different herbs. The Azerbaijani cuisine has more than 40 different plov recipes. Other second courses include many kinds of kebabs and shashliks, including lamb, beef, chicken, and fish (baliq) kebabs. Sturgeon, a common fish, is normally skewered (skewer is a thin metal or wood stick used to hold pieces of food together) and grilled as a shashlik, being served with a tart pomegranate sauce called narsharab.  Dried fruits and walnuts are used in many dishes. The traditional condiments are salt, the spices black pepper, sumac, and especially saffron. Much of the saffron comes from the Absheron Peninsula.

Black tea is the national drink, and is drunk after food is eaten. It is also popular on its own or with dried fruits.

Another popular drink is sherbet, a sweet cold drink made of fruit juice mixed or boiled with sugar, often perfumed with rose water. Azerbaijani sherbet is not sorbet, the cold dessert.

[[Neo-Keynesian economics]]

CATEGORIES: Economic theories

Neo-Keynesian economics is a school of macroeconomic thought that was developed after World War II from the writings of John Maynard Keynes. A group of economists (notably John Hicks, Franco Modigliani, and Paul Samuelson), attempted to interpret and formalize Keynes' writings, and to synthesize it with the neo-classical models of economics. This model, the IS/LM model, is nearly as influential as Keynes' original analysis in determining actual policy and economics education. It relates aggregate demand and employment to three variables, that is, the amount of money in circulation, the government budget, and the state of business expectations. This model was very popular with economists after World War II because it could be understood in terms of general equilibrium theory. Their work has become known as the neo-classical synthesis. It created the models that formed the core ideas of neo-Keynesian economics. These ideas dominated mainstream economics in the post-war period, and formed the mainstream of macroeconomic thought in the 1950s, 60s and 70s.

In the 1970s a series of developments occurred that shook neo-Keynesian theory. The developed world suffered from slow economic growth and high inflation at the same time (stagflation). Also, the work of monetarists like Milton Friedman cast doubt on neo-Keynesian theories. The result was a series of new ideas to bring tools to Keynesian analysis that would be capable of explaining the economic events of the 1970s. The next great wave of Keynesian thinking began with the attempt to give Keynesian macroeconomic reasoning a microeconomic basis. The new Keynesians helped create a "new neo-classical synthesis" that currently forms the mainstream of macroeconomic theory. Following the emergence of the new Keynesian school, neo-Keynesians have sometimes been referred to as Old-Keynesians.

[[Synchrotron light source]]

CATEGORIES: Nuclear physics, Light, Electromagnetic radiation

A synchrotron light source is a source of electromagnetic radiation produced by a synchrotron. The radiation can be artificially produced for scientific and technical purposes by specialized particle accelerators, typically by accelerating electrons. Once the high-energy electron beam has been generated, it is directed into auxiliary components such as bending magnets and insertion devices (undulators or wigglers) in storage rings and free-electron lasers. 

These supply the strong magnetic fields perpendicular to the beam which are needed to convert the high-energy electron energy into light or some other form of electronmagnetic radiation.

Synchrotron radiation may occur in accelerators either as a nuisance in particle physics experiments, or on purpose for many laboratory uses.

Electrons are accelerated to high speeds in several stages to achieve a final energy that can be in the GeV range.  In the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), proton bunches also produce the radiation at increasing amplitude and frequency as they accelerate in the vacuum field, making photoelectrons. The photoelectrons then make secondary electrons from the pipe walls with increasing frequency and density up to 7x1010.  Each proton may lose 6.7keV per turn due to this phenomenon. So, both electron synchrotrons and proton synchrotrons can be a light source.

The major applications of synchrotron light are in condensed matter physics, materials science, biology and medicine. Many experiments using synchrotron light probe the structure of matter from the sub-nanometer level of electronic structure to the micrometer and millimeter level. This is important in medical imaging. An example of a practical industrial application is the manufacturing of microstructures by the Lithography, Electroplating, and Molding (LIGA) process.

[[Black powder rocket motor]]

CATEGORIES: Rockets, Fuel

A black powder rocket motor pushes a model rocket using black powder. Black powder in the rockets is made of charcoal, sulphur, and potassium nitrate. The amount of each part can be changed to change how fast the black powder burns. The black powder burns very fast. The hot gases move fast as they leave the back of the rocket. This pushes the rocket forward.

Black powder rocket motors were made in a simple form by the Chinese. They were first written about in the early 13th century. The rocket motors have gotten better over the years. They have several uses. Some can be used as weapons. Some have cameras to take pictures from a height to get information. Some are also used just for fun.

Black powder rocket motors are only made in small sizes. If they are bigger there is a bigger chance of exploding. They also do not perform as well if they are bigger. They are made in different sizes called classes. The classes are 1/4 A through E. If the motor needs to be bigger than this, a different type of fuel is used. This is called a composite fuel. Some examples of composite fuels are ammonium perchlorate or ammonium nitrate.

[[Lake Blanche]]

CATEGORIES: Lakes of South Australia

Lake Blanche is a large salt lake in the north east corner of South Australia. It is normally dry, but can be filled by local flooding or when the Strzelecki Creek flows into it. It covers an area of about 170000. When Lake Blanche was first seen by the explorer Edward John Eyre in 1840, he believed it was part of a large horse shoe shaped lake at the end of the Flinders Ranges. This lake stopped the explorers from being able to travel any further to the north. When Charles Sturt visited the lake shore in 1845 he also thought it was part of a larger lake. In 1858 the explorer Augustus Charles Gregory was the first European to find a path between Lake Blanche and Lake Callabonna. Lake Blanche was named after the wife of the Governor of South Australia, Sir Richard Graves McDonnell. The area near the lake had been called Blanchewater Plains by explorer Benjamin Herschel Babbage in 1856. In August 1857, Captain Freeling attempted to explore the flooded lake by boat. The water was not deep enough to float the boat, and even after walking more than 5 into the lake it was still only ankle deep.

The area around Lake Blanche is now being explored for development of a uranium mine.

[[Lake Alexandrina]]

CATEGORIES: Lakes of South Australia, Ramsar sites

Lake Alexandrina is a large lake about 45 south east of Adelaide, South Australia. The lake covers an area of 56000. The Murray River flows into the north of the lake near Wellington. Water from the lake enters the sea through an opening into Encounter Bay. In 1940 a number of walls were built to stop sea water from flowing back into the lake which would stop the lake from being salty. These walls separate the lake from the Murray River's estuary lagoon, called the Coorong.

Lake Alexandrina and the Coorong are a Wetland of International Importance under the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands. Many bird species live around the lake including Curlew Sandpiper, Banded Stilt, Red-capped Plover, Masked Lapwing, Redkneed Dotterel, Black Swan, Cape Barren Goose, Musk Duck, Straw-necked Ibis, Royal Spoonbill, Rufus Night Heron and the Australian Pelican. Rare species such as the Orange Bellied Parrot and the Southern Mount Lofty Ranges Emu Wren have been seen. The large Murray Cod can also be found in the lake.

The Ngarrindjeri, an Indigenous Australian people, have lived around the lake and the wetlands for thousands of years. The first Europens to find the lake were people hunting seals along the south east coast of Australia in 1828. In 1830, the explorer Charles Sturt reached the lake by boat after a long journey down the Murrumbidgee, the Darling and the Murray Rivers. Sturt named the lake after Princess Alexandrina, who later became Queen Victoria.

Lake Alexandina became important during the 1870s when paddle steamers began to use the Murray River system to carry goods around New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. The town of Milang, on the lake, became an important port. It is now popular as a place for holidays with activities including sailing, power boating, fishing and swimming.

[[Wiggler (synchrotron)]]

CATEGORIES: Synchrotron instrumentation

A wiggler is an insertion device in a synchrotron. It is a series of magnets designed to repeatedly laterally deflect ('wiggle') a beam of charged particles inside a storage ring of a synchrotron. These deflections release synchrotron radiation. Although synchrotrons give off such radiation anyway as magnets work to bend the particles on a circle-like path, a wiggler release more intense radiation than the bending magnets.

A wiggler has a broader spectrum of radiation than an undulator. In a wiggler, the period and the strength of the magnetic field is not tuned to the frequency of radiation produced by the electrons. So, every electron in the electron bunch radiates independently. This makes a broad radiation spectrum. A wiggler can be considered to be series of bending magnets stuck together, and its radiation intensity goes up as the number of magnetic poles in the wiggler goes up.

Typically the magnets in a wiggler are arranged in a Halbach array. The design shown above is usually known as a Halbach wiggler.

[[Auto-ethnography]]

CATEGORIES: Social sciences, Ethnography

Auto-ethnography is a method of social research whose defining characteristic is that the author links personal experience and autobiography with social, political, and cultural concepts. Its difference from ethnography is the high degree of subjectivity that is introduced to the study, and the fact that the perspective of the author shows personal involvement with the subject much more than participant observation invites.

From the 1970s onwards, auto-ethnography has been gaining impact and is being used more and more. However, it still constitutes an issue of controversy and is, sometimes, criticized because of its individualistic and subjective nature, which is seen as potentially undermining of its scientific credibility. That is, the author’s personal involvement with the events and society he/she describes and analyzes is sometimes considered as something that clouds his/her objectivity. It remains, however, questionable whether auto-ethnography should be judged on the same terms as traditional ethnography, as one may argue that they have different purposes altogether, and that a subjective point of view is advantageous and what auto-ethnography has to add to traditional methods.

Culture has been in a long period of time been the biggest identification point for a lot of people and needless to say, the same applies to me. As a male individual who identifies as a black when it comes to race, I also consider myself to be an African American ethnically. Black culture will always be a part of me regardless of whether it is on the African context, African American or both. Identifying with this gives me a sense of belonging in the African American culture and community. A sense of belong bigger than family and friends in this day and age is way more important because it shades a light of your history and what you should be proud of. 

My first in-depth understanding of culture was at the time when me and my family moved from Africa to the United states of America. My short childhood living in Africa exposed me to how people in my country truly lived their culture in their day to day endeavors. It was not until we moved from Africa to the United States that I got a good comprehension of what culture really is and a clearer understanding of what cultural and ethnic belonging is and how greatly it contributes one’s wellbeing. Cultures across the world differ in diverse ways. While cultures in one continent might have some roots of similarities, crossing over to another continent illuminates the big cultural differences that exist in the world. This was brought out in the sense of living that I witnessed in the United states which was more individualistic compared to African communities who are more collectivists. I felt a little left out in the African American culture since it lacked a strong sense of community like it was in Africa.

Living in my neighborhood was really tough at first because of the necessary adjustments that had to take place in terms of culture, what to do and what not to do. This did not only apply to my immediate neighborhood but also to the city I live in. Learning how people conduct themselves and living according to their norms has proven to be easier with time. The most advantageous part of my relocation was the fact that I could easily understand the language that the natives speak meaning there was no communication barrier. The neighborhood and city culture has definitely changed me into being a more open minded person and take cognizance of equality in the world across all platforms, an example respecting women and not discriminating against them on the same level as men.

Some of the things that define my relation with my culture are rooted in my every day practices such as the food I eat. Some of my favorite foods include Jollof rice, Mandazi and fried chicken as well as fries. I love reading books that talk about the black culture and its growth over decades, I listen to Hip-Hop music, I love watching African dances. My choice in fashion is heavily influenced by the African American trends and when it comes to art, I appreciate both African and African American art. All these things define how I relate to the two diverse culture and how I stay connected with each. They also help me know my history and give a point of identification. 

As a male individual in the African American Society, who has been exposed to two different diverse cultures, navigating my gender roles have proven to be challenging over the time. While I agree with some things in my current cultural setting, I do not stand with other informalities that exist here. While I support the idea of having equality among all human beings, I do not agree that there should be selective service that favors women into getting jobs faster and those that are not dangerous. Equality should apply all the way. Other roles include behavior and dressing that should also apply equality.

Some of the gender roles that taught in the United states include standards of behavior, dressing and speaking in regards to whether one is female or male. One particular gender role that exist in the broader African American society which I have managed to navigate through is learning how to respect people’s choice of dressing and act regardless of their sex or whatever gender they choose to identify with. I have conformed to the fact that gender roles are not really defined by a person’s gender in this society, people will do what they want to do since they have the freedom to make their own choice.

My personal understanding of resistance in relation to both African and African American cultures would be; having to defy the norms that have been set by the society. Going against the cultural normality that exist brings up a resistance which in some cases gives rise to a new acceptable behavior. Living in Africa, sex orientations have always been limited to being male or female, in the recent past, other orientations such as being transgender are slowly coming up even though it does not sit in well with the norms of that society. 

Living in a world where digital standards are taking over everything, a platform where people can use to fight oppression and injustice, have cropped up as well. The power of social media is offering a platform where masses of people from different locations can rally up and protest for their cultural freedoms. Some forms of oppression that people in my neighborhood go through would be racism and police brutality. The use of twitter, as an example has enabled many to fight for their rights and have their issues resolved or at least get recognized. Fighting oppression has also been witnessed through peaceful demonstrations to make sure they are taken with all the seriousness that they deserve. 

Culture has been in a long period of time been the biggest identification point for a lot of people and needless to say, the same applies to me. As a male individual who identifies as a black when it comes to race, I also consider myself to be an African American ethnically. Black culture will always be a part of me regardless of whether it is on the African context, African American or both. Identifying with this gives me a sense of belonging in the African American culture and community.

[[Homo sacer]]

CATEGORIES: Legal terms, Society

Homo sacer (Latin for the ‘sacred man’ or ‘accursed man’) is a phrase taken from Roman law. It is

used to describe someone who is banished, and may be killed by anybody but not used in a religious killing

(sacrifice). Described by Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben in his book Homo Sacer; ‘sovereign

power and bare life’ as a person who is living a ‘naked life’ and is an outcast of society.

== Occurrence == 

Someone becomes Homo Sacer by breaking a legal agreement or oath; people who

illegally cross the borders between countries have often been referred to and treated as Homo

Sacer. In Shahram Khosravi’s book Illegal traveller he talks about how someone

forced to leave their country to find a better life elsewhere can become ‘homo sacer’, which can

lead to a feeling of separation from the rest of society.

== Consequences == 

This makes the person an outlaw; they have no civil rights and lose their protection

from the state. They are often victims of abuse and unfair treatment both through this loss of rights

but also from everyday citizens.

[[Rites of passage]]

CATEGORIES: Society

Rites of passage are rituals performed by people, individually or as a social group. They mark the end of one phase of life, and the arrival of another.

All people in every society and culture experience rites of passage. They happen differently, for various reasons, and at special times, depending on what society or culture the person comes from. Rites of passage celebrate and protect the person or people who are changing. They signify the transformation from one social status (e.g. coming of age), place (e.g. crossing a national border), condition (e.g. recovering from sickness), time (e.g. celebrating the new year), to the next.

[[Neocolonialism]]

CATEGORIES: Colonialism

Neocolonialism is a system where empires pretend to let their colonies be free, but they continue to run them secretly. The term "neo" means "new", so it means that the system is a new version of colonialism. The word neocolonialism was carefully explained by socialists in the 1960s, who were afraid their countries wouldn't really be independent. The socialists mostly talked about the old empires controlling the politics and economy of their countries, but some people also talk about neocolonialism as a way to control culture too.

Kwame Nkrumah, the first president of Ghana after it became independent from the British Empire, wrote a well-known book about neocolonialism. Many people have heard of the idea because of his book. Che Guevara is another famous opponent of neocolonialism.

Most people who use the word neocolonialism and believe it describes the world today are socialists, anti-imperialists, and other types of leftists. Liberals and right-wing people tend to disagree with the idea of neocolonialism.

[[Bariatrics]]

CATEGORIES: Medical specialties, Obesity

Bariatrics is the part of medicine that deals with obesity. Bariatrics includes using dieting, exercise, changing people's habits, drugs, and surgery to help people lose weight.

More and more people are becoming overweight or obese. People with a high body mass index (BMI) are much more likely to have certain health problems. These include heart disease, diabetes, many types of cancer, asthma, sleep apnea, and problems with muscles and bones. Obese people are also more likely to die.

Diet, exercise, changing people's habits, and drugs are tried first to help people lose weight. People who have weight loss surgery usually lose more weight than those who try the other ways. The surgery also helps reduce diseases like high blood pressure and diabetes. With each patient, doctors might use some or all of the methods, depending on what they think would work best for that patient.

[[Discrete mathematics]]

CATEGORIES: Mathematics

Discrete mathematics is the study of mathematical structures that are discrete rather than continuous.  In contrast to real numbers that vary "smoothly", discrete mathematics studies objects such as integers,  graphs, and statements in logic. These objects do not vary smoothly, but have distinct, separated values. Discrete mathematics therefore excludes topics in "continuous mathematics" such as calculus and analysis.  Discrete objects can often be counted using integers. Mathematicians say that this is the branch of mathematics dealing with countable sets (sets that have the same cardinality as subsets of the natural numbers, including rational numbers but not real numbers). However, there is no exact, universally agreed, definition of the term "discrete mathematics." Many times, discrete mathematics is described less by what is included than by what is excluded: continuously varying quantities and related notions.

The set of objects studied in discrete mathematics can be finite or infinite. The term finite mathematics is sometimes applied to parts of the field of discrete mathematics that deals with finite sets, particularly those areas relevant to business.

Research in discrete mathematics increased in the latter half of the twentieth century partly due to the development of digital computers which operate in discrete steps and store data in discrete bits. Concepts and notations from discrete mathematics are useful in studying and describing objects and problems in branches of computer science, such as computer algorithms, programming languages, cryptography, automated theorem proving, and software development. In turn, computer implementations are significant in applying ideas from discrete mathematics to real-world problems, such as in operations research.

Although the main objects of study in discrete mathematics are discrete objects, analytic methods from continuous mathematics are often employed as well.

ALS is funded by the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Basic Energy Sciences.

The ALS has over forty beamlines. They do a wide range of science at the same time as each other. Any qualified scientist can ask to use the ALS beamlines. Proposals are reviewed by others. The proposals which most people agree on are allowed to use the ALS. The ALS does not charge money to use if the user's research is made public.

The Advanced Light Source's current director is Roger Falcone.

[[Undulator]]

CATEGORIES: Synchrotron instrumentation

An undulator is an insertion device from high-energy physics and usually part of a larger 

The important dimensionless parameter 

mass and c is the speed of light, characterizes the nature of the electron motion. For 

Physicist think about undulators both using classical physics and relativity. This means that though the precision calculation is tedious the undulator can be seen as a black box. An electron enters this box and an electromagnetic pulse exits through a small exit slit. The slit should be small enough so that only the main cone passes, so that  the side lobes may be ignored. 

The polarization of the emitted radiation can be controlled by using permanent magnets to induce different periodic electron trajectories through the undulator.  If the oscillations are confined to a plane the radiation will be linearly polarized.  If the oscillation trajectory is helical, the radiation will be circularly polarized, with the handedness determined by the helix.

If  the electrons follow the Poisson distribution, a partial interference leads to a linear increase in intensity.

In the free-electron laser the intensity increases exponentially with the number of electrons. 

Physicists measure an undulator's effectiveness in terms of  spectral radiance.

[[Magnetic flux]]

CATEGORIES: Magnetism

Magnetic flux is what generates the field around a magnetic material. It consists of photons, however, unlike the light we receive from the Sun, it is at a much lower frequency. (1) This is why magnetic field lines are not visible to the naked eye.

It is the alignment of electrons in the atomic shells of Ferromagnets and, separately, the “spinning” electrons in Electromagnets, that provides a material with it’s Magnetism. (2)

The number of magnetic field lines passing through a surface (such as a loop of wire). The magnetic flux through a closed surface (such as a ball) is always zero.

The SI unit of magnetic flux is the Weber (Wb) (in derived units: volt-seconds). 

The CGS unit is the Maxwell. 

Magnetic flux is sometimes used by electrical engineers designing systems with electromagnets or designing dynamos.  Physicists designing particle accelerators also calculate magnetic flux.

[[To Catch a Predator]]

CATEGORIES: 2004 television series debuts

To Catch a Predator is a television program designed to catch adults trying to have sex with children below the age of 16.  People were lured to meet with a decoy under the pretense of sexual contact and then confronted. Show host Chris Hansen clarified in an interview with NPR News that these subjects should be labeled as potential sexual predators, and not pedophiles. "Pedophiles have a very specific definition, people who are interested in prepubescent sex," he stated. 

The series premiered in November 2004, and featured 12 investigations in total held across the United States. The investigations were conducted as undercover sting operations with the help of on-line watchdog group Perverted-Justice. Since the third installment, law enforcement and other officials were also involved, leading to the arrests of most individuals caught. No new episodes have aired since December 2007.

NBC affiliates WTMJ in Milwaukee, KSHB in Kansas City and WBRE have also done local versions of To Catch a Predator. Various spin-offs have aired in the same format, including To Catch a Con Man, To Catch an ID Thief, To Catch a Car Thief and To Catch an i-Jacker, which featured iPod thieves. To Catch a Predator is also aired on FX and Crime & Investigation Network in the United Kingdom, the Crime & Investigation Network in Australia and New Zealand and FOX Crime in Portugal.

[[Jahbulon]]

CATEGORIES: Freemasonry

Jahbulon (or Jabulon) is a word, or a confection of three syllables, that was used in the past in some rituals of certain parts of Masonry.  It is also said to be used in Ordo Templi Orientis rituals.

The origin and meaning of this word are not completely known. Different groups think the word means different things. Even Masonic researchers do not all agree to what the word means or where it came from. One Masonic scholar says that the word was first used in an early 18th century Royal Arch ritual. He said it was the name of an explorer looking for King Solomon's Temple. Another Masonic scholar thinks it is a name for God in Hebrew. The most used Masonic explanation is that it is a word that comes from putting together parts of the name of God in different historic languages.

Writers who are not Masons, especially those against Masonry, have said that it is a Masonic name for God. Some say it is the name of a unique "Masonic God". Freemasonry's officials have said many times that "There is no separate Masonic God". They have also said that there is no separate proper name for a deity in any branch of Freemasonry.  This meaning of the word has caused many religious groups to argue about and condemn Freemasonry.  In England, no ritual with the name has been in official Masonic use since February 1989. Stephen Knights, author of The Brotherhood:The Secret World of the Freemasons, says it is a trinity composed of three ancient Middle Eastern Gods, Jah, God of the Jews, Baal, God of the Phoenicians, and On, an Egyptian God.

After persistent strong criticism in the popular press, the Supreme Grand Chapter of England excised the word from its Royal Arch ritual in 1989, and replaced it with a choice between two forms of the tetragrammaton.

[[Yugoslavia at the Olympics]]

[[Sex linkage]]

CATEGORIES: Chromosomes

Sex linkage is a term in genetics. It applies to alleles (forms of a gene) on the X chromosome.

In mammals, which have an XX/XY system of sex determination, the X chromosome has many more genes than the Y chromosome. This explains the inheritance of such conditions as colour blindness and haemophilia. They are caused by recessive alleles, and usually do not show the condition in females. This is because those females carrying the mutant are most likely to be heterozygous for the allele. However, if the mutant allele is carried by a male, the condition will develop, because his X chromosome has the mutant allele, but his Y chromosome has no allele at that locus.

[[Telenovela]]

CATEGORIES: Telenovelas

A telenovela, or simply  novela, is a serial drama television program. It is popular in Latin American, Portuguese, and Spanish television programming. Telenovelas are different from soap operas. Telenovelas have an ending. They come to an end after a long run. This is usually less than one year. The telenovela combines drama with the 19th century feuilleton and the Latin American radionovela.  They are often used to give cultural messages by adding them into storylines.

Because the telenovela is similar to the American soap opera, the telenovela is often called a "Spanish soap opera" in the United States. While most English language soap operas have no ending, almost all telenovelas run for a limit time. They are usually shown five or six days a week and run for an average of 120 episodes.

Harold Egbert Camping (July 19, 1921 – December 15, 2013) was an American Christian radio broadcaster. His parents were Dutch immigrants. He served as president of Family Radio, a California-based radio station group that broadcasts to more than 150 markets in the United States, since 1958. In 2011 he retired from active broadcasting following a stroke, but maintained a role at Family Radio until his death. Camping is notable for applying numerology to his interpretations of Bible passages in an attempt to predict dates for the End Times. 

His 2011 end times prediction was that on May 21, 2011 Jesus Christ would return to Earth, the righteous would fly up to heaven, and that there would follow five months of fire, brimstone and plagues on Earth, with millions of people dying each day, culminating on October 21, 2011 with the end of the world. He had previously predicted judgment days on May 21, 1988, and September 6, 1994.

His prediction for May 21, 2011 was widely reported, in part because of a massive publicity campaign by Family Radio, and it prompted responses from both atheist and Christian organizations. After May 21 passed without the predicted incidents, Camping said he believed that a "spiritual" judgment had occurred on that date, and that the physical Rapture would occur on October 21, 2011, simultaneously with the destruction of the universe by God. Except for one press appearance on May 23, 2011, Camping largely avoided press interviews after May 21, particularly after he suffered a stroke in June. October 21, 2011, passed without the predicted apocalypse, leading the International Business Times to proclaim Camping a "false prophet." 

Camping was reported to have retired from his position at Family Radio as of October 16, 2011, only days before his last predicted date for the end of the world. However, his daughter later clarified that he had not retired outright, but was maintaining a role at the Family Radio while working from home. Camping admitted in a private interview that he no longer believed that anybody could know the time of the Rapture or the end of the world, in stark contrast to his previously staunch position on the subject.

[[Santana Formation]]

CATEGORIES: Lagerstätten, Brazil

The Santana Formation is a high quality fossil site in Brazil 115 to 108 million years ago (mya). It is in northeastern Brazil's Araripe Basin. It qualifies as a Lagerstätte, which means it is one of the best fossil sites, with many undisturbed fossils.

The strata come from the Lower Cretaceous, laid down about 92 million years ago in a shallow inland sea.

Some 25 species of fish are found, many with stomach contents preserved. This lets palaeontologists study predator–prey relationships in the ecosystem. There are also fine examples of pterosaurs, reptiles, amphibians, invertebrates (especially insects) and plants. Even dinosaurs are found here: a new maniraptor was described in 1996.

Limestone nodules formed around dead organisms; this preserved even the soft parts of their anatomy. The limestone was etched away using a mild acid. The fossils were then preserved by the 'transfer technique' which means they were embedded in a plastic resin such as polyester or epoxy.

The nearby Crato Formation is also a lagerstätte. It was produced in similar conditions, about 10 million years before the Santana Formation.

Coit Tower is a 210 tower in the Telegraph Hill neighborhood of San Francisco, California. The tower, in the city's Pioneer Park, was built in 1933. Lillie Hitchcock Coit left one-third of her estate to the city "to be expended in an appropriate manner for the purpose of adding to the beauty of the city which I have always loved".

The art deco tower is made of unpainted reinforced concrete. Architects Arthur Brown, Jr. and Henry Howard designed it. The tower has fresco murals by 27 different on-site artists and their assistants, plus two additional paintings installed after creation off-site.

The tower was not designed to resemble a fire hose nozzle, despite Coit's affinity with the San Francisco firefighters of the day, in particular with Knickerbocker Engine Company Number 5.

[[Empress Jitō]]

CATEGORIES: 645 births, 702 deaths, Emperors of Japan, Japanese poets

Empress Jitō was the 41st Emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession.

Jitō's reign started in 686 and ended in 697.  Historians consider details about the life of Empress Jitō to be possibly legendary, but probable. The name Jitō-tennō was created for him posthumously by later generations.

The conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as "traditional" until the reign of Emperor Kammu, who was the 50th monarch of the Yamato dynasty.

In the history of Japan, Jitō was the third of eight women to be empress.  The two female monarchs before Jitō were (a) Suiko and (b) Kōgyoku/Saimei.  The five women monarchs after Jitō were (c) Gemmei, (d) Genshō, (e) Kōken/Shōtoku, (f) Meishō, and (g) Go-Sakuramachi.

[[Surface integral]]

CATEGORIES: Calculus

In mathematics, a surface integral is a definite integral taken over a surface (which may be a curve set in space). Just as a line integral allows one to integrate over an arbitrary curve (of one dimension), a surface integral can be thought of as a double integral integrating over a two-dimensional surface.  Given a surface, one may integrate over its scalar fields (that is, functions which return numbers as values), or its vector fields (that is, functions which return vectors as values). 

Surface integrals have applications in physics, particularly with the classical theory of electromagnetism. 

[[Philae (spacecraft)]]

CATEGORIES: ESA spacecraft

Philae (before known as RoLand) is an ESA lander spacecraft. It went with the Rosetta spacecraft. It landed on comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenkoon on 12 November 2014 to analyze it.

The name Philae was chosen through a contest organized by ESA, won by fifteen year old Serena Olga Vismara from Milan. The name comes from the orbiter name, already defined as Rosetta, which is the name of the stele that allowed Jean-François Champollion to understand ancient Egypt hieroglyphics. In order to complete the translation, he needed to use also the monuments on the island of Philae, the same way Philae lander will help to complete the work of the Rosetta lander.

[[File:Countries by Human Development Index (2020).png|thumb|475x475px|World map indicating the Human Development Index (based on 2019 data, published on 15 December 2020).

]]

This is a list of all countries by Human Development Index as included in a United Nations Development Programme's Human Development Report (released on 15 December 2020), put together based on estimates for 2019. It covers 187 member states of the United Nations (out of 193), along with Hong Kong (of the People's Republic of China), and the Palestinian territories; 6 UN member states are not included because there is not enough data. The average HDI of regions of the World and groups of countries are also included for comparison.

The Human Development Index (HDI) is a comparative measure of life expectancy, literacy, education and standards of living for countries worldwide. It is a standard way of measuring well-being, especially child welfare. It is used to distinguish whether the country is a developed, a developing or an under-developed country, and also to measure the effect of economic policies on quality of life. The index was developed in 1990 by Pakistani economist Mahbub ul Haq and Indian economist Amartya Sen.

Countries fall into four wide human development categories: Very High Human Development (66 countries), High Human Development (53 countries), Medium Human Development (37 countries) and Low Human Development (36 countries).

From 2007 to 2010, the first two categories was referred to as developed countries, and the last two are all grouped in developing countries. The original "high human development" category has been split into two as above in the report for 2007.

Some older groupings (high/medium/low income countries) that have been removed were based on the gross domestic product (GDP) in purchasing power parity (PPP) per capita, and have been replaced by another index based on the gross national income (GNI) in purchasing power parity per capita.

[[Electric flux]]

CATEGORIES: Electromagnetism

The electric flux over a surface S is therefore given by the surface integral:

For a closed Gaussian surface, electric flux is given by:

where QS is the net charge enclosed by the surface (including both free and bound charge), and ε0 is the electric constant. This relation is known as Gauss' law for electric field in its integral form and it is one of the four Maxwell's equations.

Electric flux is not affected by charges that are not within the closed surface. But the net electric field, E, in the Gauss' Law equation, can be affected by charges that lie outside the closed surface.  Gauss' Law is true in all situations, but people can only use it to calculate when high degrees of symmetry exist in the electric field.  Examples include spherical and cylindrical symmetry. Otherwise, the calculations are too hard to do by hand and must be worked out using a computer.

Electrical flux has SI units of volt metres (V m), or, equivalently, newton metres squared per coulomb (N m2 C−1). So, the SI base units of electric flux are kg•m3•s−3•A−1.

[[Gastrolith]]

CATEGORIES: Zoology

Gastroliths, or gizzard stones, are small rocks kept by an animal inside its stomach or at an early part of the alimentary canal. The function of these is to mash up the food so digestion takes place faster. Typically, animals which do this do not have suitable teeth for grinding, and the gastroliths are a good substitute for this. 

A second function, in aquatic animals, is that gastroliths can be used for ballast to make diving easier.

In physics, an insertion device is a group of magnets that can be placed on a straight segment of a particle accelerator to be a synchrotron light source.  They are called an "insertion devices" because they replace pipe that otherwise would hold the vacuum needed to maintain the particle beam path. Many times, insertion devices are used on the circular path of a synchrotron or a storage ring.

There are two types of insertion devices. Undulators make electromagnetic radiation that is tuned to a narrow frequency range.  Wigglers make a wide range of electromagnetic radiation frequencies.

[[Collimated light]]

CATEGORIES: Optics, Astronomy

Collimated light is light whose rays are parallel. This light spreads slowly as it travels. The word collimated is related to collinear, because all the rays in collimated light line up with each other.  

Perfectly collimated light would not spread out with distance at all. No real light is perfectly collimated. Real light will spread a little as it travels. Diffraction prevents anyone from creating a perfectly collimated beam. 

Light can be roughly collimated by using a collimator – a device which narrows a beam of particles or waves. 

[[Hispanic]]

CATEGORIES: Spain

Hispanic (Spanish: Hispano, hispánico) is a word that originally meant a relationship to Hispania. This is the Iberian Peninsula and includes Portugal, Andorra, Gibraltar and Spain. Now the word is used with a more limited meaning. In the United States it is often used to mean a person of (usually) mixed race with a Spanish surname. In North America generally, the word Hispanic has lost its link to Spain and Portugal, and is mainly used to mean Latin America. 

Hispanic has also been used to mean the culture and people of the former Spanish and Portuguese Empires in America. Known as Hispanic America, this region includes Mexico, most of the Central and South American countries, and the Spanish-speaking island-nations of the Caribbean.

Spanish names, the Spanish language, and Spanish customs can also be found in other areas that were part of the Spanish and Portuguese Empires, such as in Equatorial Guinea in Africa, or in the Spanish East Indies (e.g. Philipines) and the Portuguese Brazil.

[[Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009]]

CATEGORIES: American civil rights, Discrimination, 2009 in the United States

The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009  (LLFPA) is an Act of Congress about pay discrimination that was signed into law by President Barack Obama on January 29, 2009.

The bill amends the Civil Rights Act of 1964 stating that the 180-day statute of limitations for filing an equal-pay lawsuit regarding pay discrimination resets with each new discriminatory paycheck. The law was a direct answer to the Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 550, a U.S. Supreme Court decision holding that the statute of limitations for presenting an equal-pay lawsuit begins on the date that the employer makes the initial discriminatory wage decision, not at the date of the most recent paycheck, as a lower court had ruled.

A first bill to amend the statutory limitations period and supersede the Ledbetter decision was introduced in the 110th United States Congress but was never enacted, as after having been passed by the House it failed to survive a cloture vote in the Senate due to the opposition of most of the Republican Senators. 

During the campaign for the 2008 elections, the Democrats criticized Republicans for defeating the 2007 version of the bill, citing Republican presidential candidate John McCain's opposition.  Then-candidate Barack Obama supported the bill.

After the 2008 election gave the Democratic Party control of both the House and Senate, a new version of the bill was introduced in the first session of the 111th United States Congress and quickly passed both bodies.  It became the law signed by the new President Obama after he took office on January 20.

[[Arena rock]]

CATEGORIES: Rock music

Event Centre rock (also known as arena rock, corporate rock, industry rock,or stadium rock) is a word to describe a form of rock music which is played, or intended to be played, in large venues, such as event centres, arenas, stadia, and open-air concert spaces. In such a way, genres which traditionally fall within the categories of event centre rock tend to be (yet not always) loud and anthemic; event centre rock is most traditionally associated with heavy metal, progressive rock, hard rock, glam metal or pop rock genres. Often, yet not always, event centre rock is categorised as being more mass-scale, commercially appealing, and radio-oriented music. Due to the often commercial nature of event centre rock, it is occasionally called corporate rock.

Event centre rock is generally associated with the grand shows that artists and groups within the style would hold. At these performances, large sound systems, and often elaborate lighting, additional effects and fireworks, would be included. The 1970s and 80s were a major period in event centre rock.

Whilst event centre rock has seen large popularity over the years, especially from the 1960s to the 1980s, it has also been criticised for its often commercial and extravagant nature, especially with regards to the shows and concert tours that event centre rock bands and artists would have. To some extent, genres such as pub rock, punk rock, indie rock and alternative rock grew as a reaction against the nature and aesthetic of event centre rock, opting for a less commercial and over-the-top style.

Famous bands associated with event centre rock include Kiss, Aerosmith, Journey, and Styx, amongst several others.
