The Whitewater controversy, Whitewater scandal, or simply Whitewater, was an American political controversy during the 1990s. It began with an investigation into the real estate investments of Bill and Hillary Clinton in the Whitewater Development Corporation. 

A March 1992 New York Times article published during the 1992 U.S. presidential campaign reported that the Clintons, then governor and first lady of Arkansas, had invested and lost money in the Whitewater Development Corporation.

Lewis looked for connections between the savings and loan company and the Clintons, and on September 2, 1992, she submitted a criminal referral to the FBI naming Bill and Hillary Clinton as witnesses in the Madison Guaranty case. 

David Hale, the source of criminal allegations against the Clintons, claimed in November 1993 that Bill Clinton had pressured him into providing an illegal $300,000 loan to Susan McDougal, the Clintons' partner in the Whitewater land deal. 

Jim Guy Tucker, Bill Clinton's replacement as governor, was convicted of fraud and sentenced to four years of probation for his role in the controversy. 

Neither Bill Clinton nor Hillary Clinton were ever prosecuted, after three separate inquiries found lack of evidence linking them with the criminal conduct.

[[Types of crushing machines]]

CATEGORIES: Machines

There are four traditional types of crushers in materials engineering.  They are known as jaw crushers, gyratory crushers and roll crushers. The first two crushers mentioned are the most common when it comes to mineral processing.  Roll crushers are a relatively new type of crusher and they are just starting to become more and more popular in mineral processing.  

The main idea behind how jaw crushers work is that there is a hinge plate that moves back and forth with a fixed plate is held up against the prior hinge plate.  The beginning of the process has the jaws of the crusher open to receive a rock.  The hinge plate, like a big jaw-bone, bites down on the rock and crushes it.

Gyratory crushers have a conical outer wall and a large spindle suspended from a bearing. There is a circular propeller at the bottom of the crusher that oscillates, spins around, really fast and compresses the rocks that enter.

For roll crushers, there are two side by side rolls, one fixed and the other can move a little bit from side to side.  The gap between the rollers is what determines the output size of the rocks. Forcing rocks through these gaps produces a large amount of shear stress on them and causes them to break apart.

[[Bisection method]]

CATEGORIES: Calculus

The bisection method is a way to estimate solutions for single equations. When we solve one equation, this method can help us to get a number that is very close to the real solution. 

Think about a continuous function F(x). If the curve of F(x) passes through the x-axis, it means that there must be one specific x number which makes F(x) = 0, in other words, a solution. But how to judge whether the curve passes the x-axis or not? We pick one section with lower boundary a1 and upper boundary b1. Then we calculate F(a) and F(b). If F(b) has different signal with F(a) (or F(a)*F(b) < 0), the F(x) curve will pass through the x-axis in this section, which means F(x) must have a solution in this section. In this way, we can estimate a range of the solution. 

To make our estimation more precise, we need to shorten the range which contains the solution. We divide this section into two equal parts: ( a , a/2+b/2) and (a/2+b/2, b). Then we apply the same method to judge whether there is a solution in each section. If there is no solutions in one section( F(a)*F(a/2+b/2) > 0 or F(a/2+b/2)*F(b)> 0), we ignore this section. If there is a solution in one section (F(a)*F(a/2+b/2) < 0 or F(a/2+b/2)*F(b) < 0), we continue to shorten the range until the range is smaller than the error of estimation we expected. Finally, we take the middle point of the final range as a solution of F(x).

[[Angle grinder]]

CATEGORIES: Cutting tools

An angle grinder is a handheld power tool. It is also known as a disc grinder or side grinder. They are commonly used in machine shops and metal workshops. Most angle grinders today are powered by electricity. They can be corded or battery-powered. Angle grinders can be used for cutting, grinding, and polishing objects.

There are different kinds of discs that are used for various materials and tasks. Angle grinders can use grinding stones, sanding discs, wire brush wheels, cut-off discs, abrasive grinding discs, and polishing pads. Angle grinders come in different disc sizes and motor specifications. Other differences include a power source, rpm, and arbor size. Generally disc size and power increase together. Disc size is measured in imperial or metric units. Pneumatic grinders are generally used for lighter duty jobs where more precision is required. Electric grinders are more commonly used for larger, heavy-duty jobs.

Angle grinders generate sparks when cutting ferrous metals. The blades on the angle grinder may also break during operation. Proper personal protective equipment must always be worn when using an angle grinder. Angle grinders should never be used without their guard or handle attached. Inspect the discs for cracks, defects, and wear before using an angle grinder.

[[Demis Hassabis]]

CATEGORIES: 1976 births, British computer scientists, Fellows of the Royal Society, Living people

Demosthenes "Demis" Hassabis GBR (born 27 July 1976) is a significant figure in artificial intelligence. He is a British researcher, neuroscientist, video game designer, entrepreneur, and five times winner of the Pentamind board games championship. 

Hassabis is the CEO and co-founder of DeepMind, a machine learning AI startup, founded in London in 2010 with Shane Legg and Mustafa Suleyman. Hassabis met Legg when both were postdocs at University College London's Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit, and he and Suleyman had been friends through family. Hassabis also recruited his university friend and Elixir partner David Silver.

DeepMind's mission is to "solve intelligence" and then use intelligence "to solve everything else". More concretely, DeepMind aims to use powerful general-purpose learning algorithms to build an artificial general intelligence (AGI).

The company was bought by Google for £400 million. 

They created AlphaGo, a program which defeated world champion Lee Sedol at the complex game of Go. Go had been considered a holy grail of AI, for its high number of possible board positions and resistance to existing programming techniques. However, AlphaGo beat European champion Fan Hui 5-0 in October 2015 before winning 4-1 against former world champion Lee Sedol in March 2016. 

More recently, DeepMind turned its artificial intelligence to protein-folding, one of the toughest problems in science. In December 2018, DeepMind's tool AlphaFold won the 13th Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (CASP) by successfully predicting the most accurate structure for 25 out of 43 proteins.

Although Hassabis is expert at many games, he does not program specific rules into Deep Mind. For Go and chess, the machine played many games with itself, learning from its results. In other words it taught itself how to play, given the basic rules of the game.

[[Defection]]

CATEGORIES: Politics by issue, Words

Defection is when a person leaves their home country in a way the home country claims to be illegal. To the first country, they can be seen as traitors.

It is a political label used by authoritarian countries. 

More broadly, it involves abandoning a person, cause, or doctrine to which one is bound by some tie. The tie may be one of allegiance or of duty.

An example of this today are North Koreans who escape the country to live in a new country, such as South Korea or the United States. The North Korean government makes leaving the country without permission illegal, and punishments for this are extremely harsh. Escapees who are caught usually get sent to a prison camp or are publicly put to death. There have been around 33,000 defectors from North Korea since the North Korean famine.

[[Flash (camera)]]

CATEGORIES: Photography

A camera flash, sometimes called a strobe or just a flash, is a device used in photography to allow pictures to be taken of dark areas by producing a flash of very bright light.

Flashes are often built into cameras, but external flashes are available and are mostly used by professional photographers, they can be mounted directly to the camera, or used 'off-camera' on a special stand or tripod.

Flashes were first used in the late 1800's in the form of a stick with magnesium on the top that when burned would produce very bright light (the stick was held in the air, and the camera shutter released at the same time), later camera flashes used a special type of light bulb known as a flashbulb, and modern flashes use LED's or a special type of tube which emits a flash of mostly blue light when electricity is applied to it from the flash capacitor (known as a xenon flashtube).

The use of a flash to take photographs is mostly known as 'flash photography' 

The use of flashes is not allowed in some places where it may be annoying to other people or where the bright light could damage rare or very old objects (like paintings) such as in a museum.

A giant planet is any planet much larger than Earth. They are usually mostly composed of low-boiling-point materials (gases or ices), rather than rock or other solid matter. Massive solid planets also exist. There are four giant planets in the Solar System: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. Many extrasolar giant planets have been identified orbiting other stars.

Giant planets are also sometimes called jovian planets, the adjective for the name Jupiter. They are sometimes known as gas giants. Many astronomers use the latter term only for Jupiter and Saturn. They classify Uranus and Neptune, which have different compositions, as ice giants. Both names are potentially misleading: all of the giant planets consist primarily of fluids above their critical points, where distinct gas and liquid phases do not exist. The principal components are hydrogen and helium in the case of Jupiter and Saturn, and water, ammonia and methane in the case of Uranus and Neptune.

The defining differences between a very low-mass brown dwarf and a gas giant are not clear. One school of thought is based on formation; the other, on the physics of the interior. Part of the debate is whether "brown dwarfs" must, by definition, have had nuclear fusion at some point in their history.

[[Hot Jupiter]]

CATEGORIES: Planets

Hot Jupiters are a class of gas giant exoplanets that are physically similar to Jupiter but have very short orbital periods (P < 10 days). The closeness to their stars and their high surface-atmosphere temperatures led to the nickname.

Hot Jupiters are the easiest extrasolar planets to detect via the radial-velocity method. The oscillations they induce in their parent stars' motion are large and rapid compared to those of other types of planets. One of the best-known hot Jupiters is 51 Pegasi b. Discovered in 1995, it was the first extrasolar planet found orbiting a Sun-like star. 51 Pegasi b has an orbital period of about 4 days.

[[Bartolomé Esteban Murillo]]

Bartolomé Esteban Murillo (Seville, baptized on January 1, 1618– April 3, 1682) was a Spanish Baroque painter. Developed in final naturalism, he advanced towards original forms of the full baroque with a perception that sometimes precedes the rococo in some of his most peculiar and imitated pictorial creations, such as the Immaculate Conception or the Good Shepherd in child figure. A central personality of the Sevillian school, with a high number of disciples and followers who carried his influence well into the 18th century, he was also the best known and most appreciated Spanish painter outside of Spain, the only one of which Sandrart included a brief and fabled biography in his Academia picturae eruditae of 1683 with the Self-portrait of the painter engraved by Richard Collin. Conditioned by the clientele, the bulk of his production is made up of works of a religious nature destined for Sevillian churches and convents, but unlike other great Spanish masters of his time, he also cultivated genre painting on a continuous and independent basis. throughout much of his career.

The Arabian tree frog or Sanchiang tree toad (Hyla felixarabica) is a frog from the Middle East.  Scientists saw it in Israel, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Yemen and Syria.

Scientists say there are two separate groups of Arabian tree frogs: one in the hills in Yemen and Asir Mountains in Saudia Arabia and another group in Syria, Israel and the hills in Jordan.

Scientists used to think that this was the same frog as the Middle East tree frog, but it is not.  Scientists believe that the Arabian tree frog separated from the Middle East tree frog 8.4 million years ago.  They believe the two groups of frogs were separated by the Dead Sea Rift and then became different species over time.

[[Saint Thomas Christians]]

CATEGORIES: Christian denominations, Ethnic groups in India

The Saint Thomas Christians are a very old community in Kerala, India also called as  Syrian Christians of India, Nasrani or Malabar Nasrani or Malankara Nasrani or Nasrani Mappila, are an ethno-religious community of Indian Christians from the state of Kerala, who follow the East Syriac Rite, West Syriac Rite and the liturgical rites of Syriac Christianity. They trace their origins to the evangelistic or missionariy activity of Thomas the Apostle in the 1st century. Nasrani is an Arabic word for "Christian" that came from the Greek word Nazōraioi, Nazarene in English. The Saint Thomas Christians are now divided into different Churches like Eastern Catholic, Oriental Orthodox, Protestant, and independent bodies, each with their own liturgies and traditions. They are Malayali people and speak the Malayalam language

Saint Thomas Christians are a community with different ethnicities or different origins.Their culture is largely from East Syriac, West Syriac, Hindu, Jewish, and Latin Rite influences, blended with local customs and later elements derived from indigenous Indian and European colonial contacts. Their language is Malayalam, the language of Kerala, and Syriac is used for prayers.

The Saint Thomas Christians have also been nicknamed such due to their reverence for Saint Thomas the Apostle, who is said to have brought Christianity to India. The name dates back to the period of Portuguese colonisation. They are also known, especially locally, as Nasrani or Nasrani Mappila. The former means Christian; it appears to have been derived from the Hebrew word Netzer or the Aramaic Nasraya from Isaiah 11:1. Mappila is an honorific applied to members of non-Indian faiths and descendants of immigrants from the middle east who had intermarried with the local population, including Muslims (Jonaka Mappila) and Jews (Yuda Mappila). Some Syrian Christians of Travancore continue to attach this honorific title to their names. The Government of India designates members of the community as Syrian Christians, a term originating with the Dutch colonial authority that distinguishes the Saint Thomas Christians, who used Syriac (within East Syriac Rite or West Syriac Rite) as their liturgical language, from newly evangelised Christians who followed the Roman Rite.The terms Syrian or Syriac relate not to their ethnicity but to their historical, religious and liturgical connection to the Church of the East, or East Syriac Church.

History

According to tradition, Thomas the Apostle came to Muziris on the Kerala coast in AD 52 and converted many Nambudiri Brahmins to christianity and established the Ezharapallikal. The most prominent families amongst the many are Pakalomattam, Sankarapuri, Kalli, Kalliyankal, Nedumpally, Kunnappilly, Payyippilly, Vazhappilly, Maliekkal, Panakkamattom and Thayil.

The Cochin Jews are known to have existed in Kerala in the 1st century AD, and it was possible for an Aramaic-speaking Jew, such as St. Thomas from Galilee, to make a trip to Kerala then.The earliest known source connecting the Apostle to India is the Acts of Thomas, likely written in the early 3rd century, perhaps in Edessa.

A number of 3rd and 4th century Roman writers also mention Thomas' trip to India, including Ambrose of Milan, Gregory of Nazianzus, Jerome, and Ephrem the Syrian, while Eusebius of Caesarea records that St. Clement of Alexandria's teacher Pantaenus from Alexandria visited a Christian community in India using the Gospel of Matthew in Hebrew language in the 2nd century.￼

The tradition of origin of the Christians in Kerala is found in a version of the Songs of Thomas or Thomma Parvam, written in 1601 and believed to be a summary of a larger and older work.Thomas is described as arriving in or around Maliankara and founding Seven Churches, or Ezharapallikal: Kodungallur, Kollam, Niranam, Nilackal (Chayal), Gokkamangalam, Kottakkavu , Palayoor and Thiruvithamcode Arappally (a "half church"). The Thomma Parvam also narrates the conversion of Jews, natives, and the local King at Kodungallur by St Thomas. The Thomma Parvam further narrates St Thomas's mission in the rest of South India and his martyrdom at Mylapore in present-day Chennai, Tamil Nadu.￼

There is evidence that  members of the St Thomas Christian community observed Brahmin customs in the Middle Ages, such as the wearing of the sacred thread and having a kudumi. The medieval historian Pius Malekandathil believes these were customs adopted and privileges won during the beginning of the Brahmin dominance of medieval Kerala. He argues that the Syrian Christians in Kerala, integrated with Persian Christian migrant merchants, in the 9th century to become a powerful trading community and were granted the privileges by the local rulers to promote revenue generation and to undermine Buddhist and Jain traders who rivaled the Brahmins for religious and political hegemony in Kerala at the time.

[[Tamil Brahmins]]

Tamil Brahmins are Tamil-speaking Brahmins, primarily living in Tamil Nadu, although a few of them have settled in other states like, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and   Karnataka. They can be broadly divided into three religious groups, Gurukkals who follow Saivism, Iyers who follow the Srauta and Smartha tradition and Iyengars who follow Sri Vaishnavism.

[[Tulu Nadu]]

Tulu Nadu, also called as Tulunaad, is a region on the southwestern coast of India. The Tulu people, known as 'Tuluva' (plural 'Tuluver'), speakers of Tulu, a Dravidian language, are the preponderant ethnic group of this region. South Canara, an erstwhile district and a historical area, encompassing the undivided territory of the contemporary Udupi, Dakshina Kannada, and Kasaragod districts, forms the cultural area of the Tuluver.

Historically, Tulu Nadu lay between the Gangavali River (Uttara Kannada district) in the north and the Chandragiri River (Kasaragod taluka) in the south. Currently, Tulu Nadu consists of the Udupi and Dakshina Kannada districts of Karnataka, and the northern parts of the Kasaragod district of Kerala up to the Chandragiri River.

This region is not an official administrative entity. However, the Tulu Nadu state movement has been gaining momentum since the Indian States Reorganisation Act, 1956.

Mangalore, the second largest and a major city of Karnataka, is the chief and largest city of Tulu Nadu. Udupi, Kasaragod and Puttur are the other major cities of this region.

[[Knanaya]]

The Knānāya, (from Syriac: Knā'nāya (Canaanite)) also known as the Southists or Tekkumbhagar, are an endogamous ethnic group found among the Saint Thomas Christian community of Kerala, India. They are differentiated from another part of the community, known in this context as the Northists (Vaddakkumbhagar). There are about 300,000 Knanaya in India and elsewhere.

The origins of the division of the Saint Thomas Christians into Northist and Southist groups is traced back to the arrival of the Syrian merchant Thomas of Cana (Knāi Thoma) who led a migration of Syriac Christians (Jewish-Christians) from Mesopotamia to India in the 4th or 8th century. The Knanaya claim descent from Thomas of Cana and those who came with him. The communities arrival was recorded on the "Thomas of Cana copper plates " which existed in Kerala until the 17th century after which point they were taken to Portugal by the Franciscan Order. The ethnic division between the Knanaya and other St. Thomas Christians was observed during the Portuguese colonization of India in the 16th century and was noted throughout the European colonial era.

Today, the majority of Knanaya are members of the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church (Kottayam Archeparchy) and the Jacobite Syrian Orthodox Church (Knanaya Archdiocese). They became increasingly prominent in Kerala in the late 19th century. Many Knanaya migrated away during the 20th and 21st centuries, largely westward, forming communities in non-Malayalam speaking areas, with a large expatriate community currently living in Houston, Texas and Chicago, Illinois in the United States.

[[White hole]]

CATEGORIES: Cosmology

A white hole is a hypothetical region in spacetime. It has not been proven to exist. 

It is said to be the exact opposite of a black hole. While a black hole sucks in objects to its singularity, the white hole emits matter from its singularity. A white hole may be formed after a black hole can no longer suck things in. Immediately, it turns into a white hole and starts emitting the things that it has previously sucked in before. Nothing can enter a white hole as its emitting force is too great. In this sense, it is the reverse of a black hole, which can be entered only from the outside and from which energy-matter, light and information cannot escape.

Like black holes, white holes have properties like mass, charge, and angular momentum. They attract matter like any other mass, but objects falling towards a white hole would never actually reach the white hole's event horizon.

[[Digital distribution]]

CATEGORIES: Technology, File sharing

Digital distribution is the delivery (through downloading) of any digital content, including audio, e-books, games, PDFs, pictures, software, and video. Digital distribution is handled through a digital distribution platform that's designed to stream the digital content or allow the content to be downloaded in full. 

Also referred to as content delivery, online distribution, or electronic software distribution (ESD), among others, is the delivery or distribution of digital media content such as audio, video, e-books, video games, and other software.

A primary characteristic of online distribution is its direct nature. To make a commercially successful work, artists usually must enter their industry's publishing chain. Publishers help artists advertise, fund and distribute their work to retail outlets. In some industries, particularly video games, artists find themselves bound to publishers, and in many cases unable to make the content they want; the publisher might not think it will profit well. This can quickly lead to the standardization of the content and to the stifling of new, potentially risky ideas.

By opting for online distribution, an artist can get their work into the public sphere of interest easily with potentially minimum business overhead. This often leads to cheaper goods for the consumer, increased profits for the artists, as well as increased artistic freedom. Online distribution platforms often contain or act as a form of digital rights management.

Online distribution also opens the door to new business models (e.g., the Open Music Model). For instance, an artist could release one track from an album or one chapter from a book at a time instead of waiting for them all to be completed. This either gives them a cash boost to help continue their projects or indicates that their work might not be financially viable. This is hopefully done before they have spent excessive money and time on a project deemed to remain unprofitable. Video games have increased flexibility in this area, demonstrated by micropayment models. A clear result of these new models is their accessibility to smaller artists or artist teams who do not have the time, funds, or expertise to make a new product in one go.

An example of this can be found in the music industry. Indie artists may access the same distribution channels as major record labels, with potentially fewer restrictions and manufacturing costs. There is a growing collection of 'Internet labels' that offer distribution to unsigned or independent artists directly to online music stores, and in some cases marketing and promotion services. Further, many bands are able to bypass this completely, and offer their music for sale via their own independently controlled websites.

An issue is the large number of incompatible formats in which content is delivered, restricting the devices that may be used, or making data conversion necessary.Tech-stub

[[North Korean defectors]]

CATEGORIES: History of North Korea

North Korean defectors are North Korean people who left North Korea to become citizens in a new country. In North Korea, it is against the law to leave North Korea without permission. North Koreans are also not allowed to change their own citizenship, so anyone born a North Korean must also die a North Korean. The punishment for leaving North Korea without permission is extremely harsh. People who are caught are usually sent a prison camp or put to death in public. Like many other crimes in North Korea, illegally leaving the country may not only punish the accused, but also his or her family up to three generations.

Although the punishments for illegally leaving North Korea are extremely harsh, the number who try to leave the country is still somewhat high. This is because North Koreans are so poor and have so little freedom that defectors believe finding a better life in a new country is worth risking their lives for it. Since the North Korean famine in the 1990s, more than 30,000 North Koreans have successfully left and have come to South Korea. Some sources say that somewhere between 100,000 to 300,000 North Koreans escaped into Russia or China since 1953. Of the defectors who came to South Korea, more than 70% are women. 

The goal of most defectors is to get to South Korea because the South Korean constitution allows South Korean citizenship to anyone born in either North or South Korea. However, the way to get to South Korea is so difficult that most defectors never made it there. There are many different ways to get to South Korea, and all are difficult. However, some are more difficult than others.

One possible way is to cross the North-South Korea border through the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). However, most defectors do not take this route because it is extremely deadly. The DMZ has many landmines, tanks, electric wires, machine gun towers, and guards on both sides. In fact, North Korean soldiers have orders to kill any North Korean trying to cross the border. In some cases, South Korean soldiers have actually rescued some North Koreans crossing the border. Only 21 of the 33,000 defectors have crossed the DMZ and lived through it. Almost all of these were North Korean soldiers who had some knowledge of the DMZ.

There were at least two defectors who successfully swam to Japan.

However, most defectors begin their escape through China. This is because the Tumen and Yalu Rivers (the rivers that make up the China-North Korea border) are much easier and safer to cross. However, most defectors do not stay in China because they are still in danger. Most defectors caught by the China government are either sent back to North Korea, where they would most likely be killed, or be sold as a wife or a sex slave in China. This is why most North Korean defectors try to go into second country before finally coming to South Korea. These countries include Mongolia, Russia, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand.

[[Pyramid of Neferirkare]]

CATEGORIES: Pharaohs

The Pyramid of Neferirkare was built for the Fifth Dynasty pharaoh Neferirkare Kakai in the 25th century BC. 

It was the tallest structure on the highest site at the necropolis of Abusir, between Giza and Saqqara. It still towers over the necropolis. The pyramid is also significant because its evacuation led to the discovery of the Abusir Papyri.

The Fifth Dynasty marked the end of the great pyramid constructions during the Old Kingdom.

Pyramids of the era were smaller and became more standardized. There was still intricate relief decoration. Neferirkare's pyramid deviated from convention as it was originally built as a step pyramid. That design that had gone out of date after the Third Dynasty (26th or 27th century BC). 

The pharaoh's death left the work to be completed by his successors. The remaining works were completed in haste, using cheaper building material. Because of the haste, Neferirkare's monument lacked several basic elements of a pyramid complex: a valley temple, a causeway, and a cult pyramid. 

The monuments to Neferirkare's consort, Khentkaus II; and his sons, Neferefre and Nyuserre Ini, are in the surrounds.

[[(307261) 2002 MS4]]

CATEGORIES: Kuiper belt objects, Possible dwarf planets

(307261) 2002 MS4 is a large classical Kuiper belt object. It is a possible dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt. It was discovered in 2002 by Chad Trujillo and Michael Brown.

The Spitzer Space Telescope estimated it to have a diameter of 726±123 km, while the Herschel Space Telescope estimated it to be 934±47 km.

2002 MS4 does not have any known moons orbiting it, thus an accurate mass estimate cannot be made. Based on its size, Brown lists it as nearly certain to be a dwarf planet, however, its low albedo may imply the opposite: dark, mid-sized bodies such as this, less than about 1000 km in diameter and with albedos less than about 0.2, have likely never collapsed into solid bodies, much less differentiated or relaxed into hydrostatic equilibrium, and thus are unlikely to be dwarf planets.

As of 2019, the rotation period of 2002 MS4 is unknown. Observations in 2005 and 2011 showed possible periods of either 7.33 hours or its alias 10.44 hours (single-peaked), or twice those values for the double-peaked solution, with a small light curve amplitude of 0.05±0.01 mag. Light curve observations of 2002 MS4 are difficult because of the dense field of background stars it is crossing. Observations made in June and July 2011 took advantage of 2002 MS4 moving in front of a dark nebula.

Lactic acid bacteria are bacteria which make lactic acid. This is an end product of carbohydrate fermentation. The bacteria change carbohydrates to lactic acid and energy. 

The bacteria are the order Lactobacillales.  Most of them are anaerobic: they do not need oxygen. Usually, they can live well in acidic environments. They are either rod-shaped, or spherical. They are found in decomposing plants and milk products. 

Lactic acid bacteria are important, and they are common. There are about 40 genera. Some species occur in the gut of animals, including humans. Several lactic acid bacteria are pathogens: they cause infectious diseases.

Lactic acid fermentation has been used since the Stone Age. It makes food last longer, and be easier to digest. Lactic acid fermentation is used in the production of cheese and yogurt.

Adult humans originally could not digest milk products. Then, all humans were lactose intolerant (as, for example, cats are after weaning). Lactase persistence is the phenotype where genes prolonging the activity of lactase beyond infancy. Humans are unusual in having lactase persistence. We know it evolved fairly recently (in the last 10,000 years) among some populations. Still, most people worldwide are lactase nonpersistent. They cannot digest lactose products after weaning. The evidence is that lactose persistence grew in human groups who herded cattle. To them it was a great advantage: they could digest milk throughout life.

[[Baculum]]

CATEGORIES: Reproductive system

The baculum (also penis bone),  is a bone found in the penis of many male mammals. It is absent in the human penis, but present in the penises of our close relatives the apes, such as the gorilla and chimpanzee.

The bone is located along the top of the penis and it aids in sex  by keeping it stiff for a long time during the sex act. 

A bone in the penis allows a male to mate for a much longer time with a female. This can be an advantage as it prevents a rival male from having sex with the female for some time.

Male animals without a penis bone tend to form close emotional bonds with a female and so ensure they are the father of her offspring.

[[Partnership (cricket)]]

CATEGORIES: Cricket, Sports words

In cricket, there are two batsmen (scoring players) on the field who are in a partnership. Each batsman is in one of the two batsmen's grounds during their team's scoring turn. When the two batsmen run between the grounds, they score one run for each time both batsmen swap grounds, but when both batsmen are not in one of the grounds, their opponents can hit the wicket in that ground with the ball to temporarily prevent the batsmen from scoring further runs, and run out the batsman nearest that ground. The batsman who is in the ground at the striker's end of the pitch at the start of a delivery is the one who attempts to hit the ball during that delivery, while the other batsman only runs.

Every time one of the two batsmen on the field gets out, another batsman enters the field and has a new partnership with the batsman who did not get out. Each partnership is named by looking at the number of batters who were out before and after the partnership; for example, the partnership between the two batsmen who are on the field when only one batter on the team is out is called the "second-wicket partnership", because it happens after the team has lost 1 wicket (had 1 batter get out), but before the loss of the team's second wicket. Because of this, it rarely happens that a batter retires (leaves the field without being out) and a new batter enters the field without changing the number of the partnership.

[[Dynamical system]]

CATEGORIES: Systems theory

A Dynamical system is a mathematical model of a process, that is dependent on time. The process is homogeneous, it only depends on the initial state. The current terminology was established by Henri Poincaré and George David Birkhoff. 

Dynamical systems are very common. Examples are the movement of a pendulum in physics, or the predator-prey equations in biology.

[[Predator-prey equations]]

CATEGORIES: Mathematics, Ecology

The predator-prey equations is an ecological system of two linked equations that models two species that depend on each other: One is the prey, which provides food for the other, the predator. Both prey and predator populations grow if conditions are right.  Alfred J. Lotka found these equations in 1925. Vito Volterra  found them, independently, in 1926. For this reason, the equations are also called Lotka-Volterra equations.

The equations themselves are non-linear differential equations. 

There are a number of pre-conditions 

In this case the solution of the differential equations is deterministic and continuous. This means that the generations of both the predator and prey are overlapping all the time.

The solutions to the equations lead to the Lotka-Volterra rules:

[[Ethiopian-Eritrean Evangelicalism]]

P'ent'ay (from Ge'ez Script: ጴንጤ) is an originally Amharic-Tigrinya language term for Pentecostal Protestant Christians within Ethiopia and Eritrea, and the Ethiopian and Eritrean diaspora. Today, the term refers to all Evangelical Christian denominations and organisations in Ethiopian and Eritrean societies as Ethiopian-Eritrean Evangelicalism or the Ethiopian-Eritrean Evangelical Church. Sometimes the denominations and organisations are also known as Wenigēlawī (from Ge'ez Script: ወንጌላዊ).

Ethiopian and Eritrean Evangelical Christians are the result of American and European Protestant missionary work among youth who left the Orthodox Tewahedo churches because of theological differences, and later fanned by persecution against them. P'ent'ay Christians schismed from the Orthodox Tewahedo churches, other branches of Christianity, or converted from other religions with the aid of Protestant missionaries to reform Ethiopian Christianity from what they perceived doctrinal-theological diversions. Since the creation of P'ent'ay churches and organisations, prominent movements among them have been Pentecostalism, the Baptist tradition, Lutheranism, Methodism, Presbyterianism, and the Mennonites.

[[Acculturation]]

CATEGORIES: Cultural studies

Acculturation is a term used to describe how an individual or a group from one culture interacts directly with an individual or group from a different culture. Sometimes, these two cultures may be similar, or they may be very different. Unlike culture shock, acculturation includes the ways both cultures influence each other. Also, culture shock is only focused on the individual or group who is entering a new culture. With acculturation, both cultures are looked at. Many things can be exchanged between the two cultures like language, ways of living, or foods. Acculturation is focused on the process of two cultures interacting over a long period of time, not once or twice. Cultural diffusion is different from acculturation because diffusion may occur once or twice, and means that there is an equal balance between the two things involved; with acculturation, this equal balance is not guaranteed.

[[Intraspecific competition]]

CATEGORIES: Biological competition

In ecology, intraspecific competition is when two individuals of the same species compete for limited resources. Usually, the one winning the competition has a better fitness, and may better be able to reproduce. Examples for resources are food, water, space, light, or mates. This is different from interspecific competition vwhere members of different species compete. Intraspecific competition is important, because through evolution, species can become better adapted to where they live.

[[Interspecific competition]]

CATEGORIES: Biological competition

In ecology, interspecific competition is when individuals of different species compete for the same resources, in an ecosystem. Examples for such resources are food, or space. Even species that never meet can compete with each other, because they need the same resources: Two kinds of predators might prey on the same animals.  Interspecific competition is important, because it regulates the population of the different species. It is one of the ways natural selection happens. Interspecific competition causes evolution. 

When two individuals of the same species compete, this is called intraspecific competition.

[[Forgetting curve]]

CATEGORIES: Psychology, Learning

The forgetting curve is an idea from psychology, that shows how rapidly people forget things, if they do nothing to retain them. German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus discovered it. A related concept is the strength of memory: People with a stronger memory are able to remember things longer. Ebbinghaus tested how long he could remember random syllables, and recorded the results in his paper Über das Gedächtnis (1885). In 1913, this was translated into English as Memory: A Contribution to Experimental Psychology". Ebbinghaus studied the memorisation of nonsense syllables, such as "WID" and "ZOF" (CVCs or Consonant–Vowel–Consonant) by repeatedly testing himself after various time periods and recording the results. He plotted these results on a graph creating what is now known as the "forgetting curve". Ebbinghaus investigated the rate of forgetting, but not the effect of spaced repetition on the increase in retrievability of memories.

As a rough guide, after 20 minutes, people can only recall about 60% of what they memorized. After a week, only about 15% is left. When Ebbinghaus did the experiment, he used meaningless sequences of syllables. In the 20th century, several other researchers repeated the experiment. One of them was Georg Elias Müller. For this reason, the results are still considered to be valid.

To be able to remember things better, more repetitions are needed. Things that are needed and used more often, will not be forgotten so easily.

[[Hermann Ebbinghaus]]

Hermann Ebbinghaus (24 January 1850 – 26 February 1909) was a German psychologist. Today, he is mostly known for his work regarding learning and forgetting. He was the first to do experiments to explore how memory works. He first described the forgetting curve, the learning curve and the spacing effect. The Ebbinghaus illusion, which is named after him is related to the perception, not memory. His son was the philosopher Julius Ebbinghaus. 

In 1896, he did a test on children in school: The pupils had to complete sentences, and their teacher had to rate each pupil, if the pupil was in the lowest, the middle or the highest third of all the people in the class. Ebbinghaus saw a relationship between the teacher's rating, and the result of the pupil, but he could not give a correlation (because he was lacking the tools to do so). This was possibly the first test of verbal intelligence in a group. 

Many of his experimental methods to rate memory performance are still in use.

Ebbinghaus died of pneumonia, when he was 59 years old.

[[Qisas]]

CATEGORIES: Law

Qisas or Qiṣāṣ (Qiṣāṣ) is a term interpreted to mean "retaliation in kind", "eye for an eye", or retributive justice. 

In historical practice, qisas appears in two forms. One of them is, the punishment of the perpetrator "with the same act" in crimes "committed against the physical integrity of the person, such as a life for a life, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth". Another application is related to the social status of the perpetrator and the victim. In the tribal understanding, when a person kills a woman, a slave or an honorable person from another tribe, a person "of similar status from the tribe to which the murderer belongs" will be killed in return. As a general custom, killing the master's to slave, father's to child, husband's to wife was not punished with retaliation, and retaliation was not applied to the man who killed the woman as a rule. The condition of "social equality" in qisas means that; "if a socially inferior person kills someone from the upper class, qisas will be applied", whereas "if someone from the upper class kills someone from the lower class, it cannot be applied". 

In this case, compensation can be paid to the family of the murdered person.

The main verse for implementation in Islam is Al Baqara; 178 verse;

: 'Believers! Retaliation is ordained for you regarding the people who were killed. Free versus free, captive versus captive, woman versus woman. Whoever is forgiven by the brother of the slain for a price, let him abide by the custom and pay the price well."

In traditional Islamic law (sharia), the doctrine of qisas allows a punishment analogous to the crime. Qisas is available to the victim or victim's heirs against a person convicted of murder or intentional bodily injury. In the case of murder, qisas gives the right to take the life of the killer, if the latter is convicted and the court approves. Those who are entitled to qisas have the option of receiving monetary compensation (diyya) or granting pardon to the person instead.

[[National parks and nature reserves of Israel]]

CATEGORIES: Geography of Israel, National parks in Asia

The national parks of Israel are historic sites or nature reserves, which are mostly operated by the National Nature and Parks Authority. In 2015, Israel had 81 national parks and more than 400 nature reserves.

Some of the country's most notable parks are located at sites such as Tel Megiddo, Jerusalem and Ashkelon. These include the "Alexander stream" and "Mount Carmel National Park". Several parks and nature reserves have camping options, such as tent grounds and bungalows, open to small groups or campers. The main idea behind these parks and reserves is to guard the values of nature, landscape, heritage, and species.

Following the drying of Lake Hula, the Hula Reserve was established in 1964 and became the first declared nature reserve in Israel. It is a major stopover for birds migrating between Africa, Europe and Asia. In 1963 the Israeli parliament approved the "National parks and nature reserves act", and as a result, two authorities were established: the National Parks Authority and the Nature Reserves Authority. In 1998 the two authorities were merged into one body - Israel Nature and Parks Authority.

In Israel, the difference between national parks and nature reserves is often hard to make. National parks are in most cases centered around archaeological sites, but sometimes include protected nature as well. The nature reserves often contain not just protected flowers, trees and animals, but also archaeological sites of importance.

[[1980 United States heat wave]]

CATEGORIES: Severe weather, Droughts, Natural disasters in the United States, 1980 in the United States

The 1980 United States heat wave was a period of strong heat and drought. It caused serious havoc and damage in the Southern Great Plains and much of the Midwestern United States during the summer of 1980. It was one of the most devastating and damaging natural disasters in terms of deaths.

The heat wave first got started in June 1980. A strong high pressure area began building in the central and Southern United States. That allowed the temperatures to soar to 90 almost every day from June to September. This high pressure system acted as a cap on the atmosphere. That prevented thunderstorm development and caused severe drought conditions. But the heat wave broke when the dying Hurricane Allen stopped the weather pattern.

The heat wave and drought led a number of cities in the Midwest and South to have record heat. In Kansas City, Missouri, the high temperature was only below 90 twice. In the same city, the high temperature hit 100 17 days in a row. In Memphis, Tennessee, the high temperature reached 108 on Sunday, July 13. It was part of a 15-day stretch of 100 temperatures that lasted from July 6 to July 20.

The agricultural damage by the 1980 heat wave and drought was over $20 billion (1980 USD). That allowed the temperatures to soar to 90 almost every day from June to September. This high pressure system acted as a cap on the atmosphere.

In Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas, high temperatures exceeded 100 a total of 69 times. Forty-two of those were consecutive days. In Dallas-Fort Worth, the high temperature hit 113 on two days: June 26 and 27.

[[Coal forest]]

CATEGORIES: Forests, Fossil plants, Carboniferous, Continents

Coal forests were huge areas of wetlands which covered much of the Earth's tropical land areas in the late Carboniferous (Pennsylvanian) and Permian times.  

At the time most continents were crowded together in the supercontinent Gondwana. They lay on the path of tropical rainfall. As vegetable matter from these forests decayed, enormous deposits of peat accumulated, which later changed into coal. Now those continents are wide apart, but they have the coalfields which those ancient forests left behind.

Much of the carbon in the peat deposits produced by coal forests came from photosynthetic splitting of carbon dioxide. This released oxygen into the atmosphere. This increased the oxygen level, perhaps as high as about 35%. This had the effect of making the air more easily breathable by animals with limitrd respiratory systems. This may explain the size of Meganeura compared to modern dragonflies.

The coal forests covered tropical Euramerica (Europe, eastern North America, northwesternmost Africa) and  China. Eventually, climate change devastated these tropical rainforests. The so-called Carboniferous rainforest collapse was caused by a cooler drier climate which broke up the rainforest ecosystem. The cause of this change was mountain uplift, no doubt caused by the continental plates squeezing against each other.  During most of the rest of Carboniferous times, the coal forests were restricted to North America (such as the Appalachian and Illinois coal basins) and central Europe.

At the very end of the Carboniferous period, the coal forests underwent a resurgence, expanding mainly in eastern Asia, notably China. They never recovered fully in Euramerica.  The Chinese coal forests continued to flourish well into Permian times.

[[Arsphenamine]]

CATEGORIES: Antibiotics

Arsphenamine, also known as Salvarsan or compound 606, is a drug. It was introduced at the beginning of the 1910s. It was the first effective treatment for syphilis and African trypanosomiasis. This organoarsenic compound was the first modern antimicrobial  agent.

Arsphenamine was first synthesized in 1907 in Paul Ehrlich's lab by Alfred Bertheim. 

The antisyphilitic activity of this compound was discovered by Sahachiro Hata in 1909. He surveyed hundreds of newly synthesized organic arsenical compounds. Ehrlich thought that by screening many compounds, a drug could be discovered which would have anti-microbial activity but not kill the patient.

Ehrlich's laboratory developed a more soluble (but slightly less effective) arsenical compound, Neosalvarsan (neoarsphenamine), which was easier to prepare.

[[Territory (animal)]]

CATEGORIES: Ethology

In ethology, territory is the area that a species of  animal consistently defends against related animals. Sometimes it means areas defended against animals of other species. Animals that defend territories in this way are referred to as territorial.

Territoriality is not shown by most species. More commonly, a  group of animals has an area that they use but do not necessarily defend. This is called their home range. The home ranges of different groups of animals often overlap, and in the overlap areas, the groups tend to avoid each other. 

Many animals use vocalisations to advertise their territory. These are short-term signals given only when the animal is present. The sound can travel long distances and through various habitats. Examples include birds, frogs and canids.

Scent markings are used by many mammals. Some have special scent glands; others squirt urine on key places. Domestic cats have graded ritualized aggression. This starts off with vocalizations and sometimes mounts to direct attack.

Territories may be held by an individual, a mated or unmated pair, or a group, and it may vary at different times of the year.

[[Collie]]

CATEGORIES: Dogs

Collies form a type of herding dogs, including many similar landraces and  standardized breeds. The type began in Scotland and Northern England.  Collies are usually medium-sized, fairly lightly-built dogs, with pointed noses.  Many breeds have a white color over the shoulders.  Collies are very active, and most types of collies are excellent at herding.  Collie breeds have spread through many parts of the world (especially Australia and North America), and have then made many varieties, sometimes mixed with other dog types (cross breeding, for example, the Borador).  Some collie breeds are still used as working dogs for herding cattle, sheep, and other livestock, while others are kept as pets, show dogs or for dog sports, in which they display great agility, stamina and trainability. While the American Kennel Club has a breed they call "collie", in fact collie dogs are a type of herding dog including many related landraces and formal breeds. There are usually major differences between show dogs and those bred for herding trials or dog sports: the herding dogs show good agility, stamina and trainability and behaviour.

Common use of the name "collie" in some areas is limited to certain breeds — the name means Rough Collie in parts of the United States, and Border Collie in many parts of Great Britain.  Most collie dog types do not actually include "collie" in their name (see Welsh Sheepdog at right).

[[Andean mountain cat]]

CATEGORIES: Felines, Mammals of South America

The Andean cat, Andean highland cat or Andean mountain cat (Leopardus jacobita) is a small wild cat that lives in the Andes mountain range.  They live in Peru, Bolivia, northern Argentina and northern Chile.

The adult Andean cat is 57 to 64 cm long from its nose to the end of its body, and its tail is another 41 to 48 cm long.  It is about 36 cm tall and weighs between 4 and 6 kg.  Its fur is gray with places that are brown and some stripes.  Its hairs can be 5 cm long.  Young cats have lighter fur than adult cats.  Young Andean cats look like pampas cats, which live in the same places as the Andean cat.

It eats many different kinds of small animals, for example lizards and birds.  Its main food is the mountain vizcacha.  Its main food used to be the mountain chinchilla, but most of the chinchillas are dead now and the ones that are a live do not live where the Andean cat lives.  This cat likes to live in rocky, open places more than it likes forests.

The Andean cat is in danger of dying out because humans are using or want to use the land that it lives on, breaking its living space into small pieces so that it has to cross roads and other human areas to get from place to place.  It is endangered because many of the animals it eats are gone. It is endangered because humans like to catch it for its fur.  It is also endangered because the Andean cat and its body parts is important to traditional medicine in Peru and in religious ceremonies for some of the indigenous people of the Andes.

[[Ngwane V]]

Ngwane V (also known as Mahlokohla, Bhunu, Hhili) (11 May 1876 - 10 December 1899) was the King of Swaziland from 1895 until his death on 10 December 1899. Ngwane was born the son of Mbandzeni and his mother was Labotsibeni Mdluli. He ascended to the throne after a short regency of Queen Mother Tibati Nkambule. He was only 16 years old when he became king. His royal capital was at Zombodze while the Queen Mother's residence was at Lobamba. Ngwane became the king after the Swaziland convention of 1894. This had led to the classification of Swaziland as a protected state of the South African Republic which was then led by President Paul Kruger. During this time Swaziland had a partial Dutch administration in parallel to Ngwane's administration. The Dutch or European for European interests and Ngwane as head and authority of the Swazi nation. An annual payment was made to Ngwane and Labotsibeni while they were in office from taxes collected and from contributions from concessionaires and taxes. Ngwane's rule was short. In 1899 the Anglo-Boer war began, and brought to an end the Dutch or Boer partial administration of Swaziland and hence gave way to independence. However Mahlokohla died on 10 December of that year while dancing incwala. This was hid from the nation until the ceremony was over. Ngwane was succeeded by his four-month-old son Nkhotfotjeni and his wife Lomawa Ndwandwe. His mother Labotsibeni who had been very influential during his reign continued as queen regent until Sobhuza was crowned in 1921. Ngwane's reign gave way to a stable territory surrounded by conflicting states. Today Mahlokohla is named for one of the main streets, Mahlokohla Street in Swaziland's capital Mbabane.

[[Mbandzeni]]

His mother the wife of King Mswati had died when he was still very young. Mbandzeni ascended to the throne after his half brother Ludvonga II died before he could become the king. Ludvonga's death resulted in his mother Inkhosikati Lamgangeni adopting Mbandzeni who was motherless as her son, thus making him King and her the Queen mother of Swaziland. His royal capital was at Mbekelweni. During his kingship Mbandzeni, granted many mining, farming, trading and administrative concessions to white settlers from Britain and the Transvaal. These concessions granted with the help of Offy Sherpstone eventually led to the conventions of 1884 and 1894, which reduced the overall borders of Swaziland and later made Swaziland a protectorate of the South African Republic. During a period of concessions preceded by famine around 1877 some of the tindvunas (governors) from within Swaziland like Mshiza Maseko and Ntengu kaGama Mbokane were given permission by King Mbandzeni to relocate to farms towards the Komati River, Mshiza Maseko later settled in a place called eLuvalweni, where he was later buried. Mbandzeni, still in command of a large Swazi army of more than 15000 men aided the British in defeating Sekhukhune in 1879 and preventing Zulu incursion into the Transvaal during the same year. As a result, he guaranteed his country's independence and international recognition despite the Scramble for Africa which was taking place at the time. Mbandzeni died after an illness in 1889 and is quoted to have said in his deathbed "the Swazi kingship dies with me". He was buried at the royal cemetery at Mbilaneni alongside his father and grandfather Sobhuza I. Mbandzeni was succeeded by his young son Mahlokohla and his wife Queen Labotsibeni Mdluli after a 5 year regency of Queen Tibati Nkambule. Today a number of buildings and roads in Swaziland are named after Mbandzeni. Among these the Mbandzeni house in Mbabane and the Mbandzeni Highway to Siteki are named after him.

Mswati was the son of Sobhuza I and Tsandzile Ndwandwe (known as 'LaZidze) who after ruling as Queen Mother became Queen Regent after the death of her son. When Sobhuza died, Mswati inherited the kingdom.  At that time, it was from present day Barberton in the north and included the Nomahasha district in Mozambique. Mswati's became a strong military power after Mswati and his brothers Fokoti, Somcuba and Malambule stopped fighting each other.

When Mswati's armies attacked other Bantu armies or nations, they stole cattle and captured people instead of trying to make the other people's territory part of their kingdom. Around this time, the Trekboers became the first Europeans to meet any Swazis.  

Mswati made Swazi territory much larger than it is today. There were military outposts and royal village outposts such as Mbhuleni, on the upper Komati River at the foot of the Mkongomo Mountains, south of Badplaas, Mekemeke which is east of the Mbayiyane Mountains, situated east of Mantibovu (Low’s Creek). The death of Mswati II in July 1868 ended the era of Swazi conquest, territorial expansion and resulted in unification of various people into one nation.

[[Haltlose personality disorder]]

CATEGORIES: Psychology, Psychiatry, Borderline personality disorder, Personality disorders, Criminal justice, Crime in Germany

Haltlose personality disorder is a mental illness that displays as selfishness, blaming others for the actions they have committed, lacking direction in life and a lack of insight and self-control. They are unable to learn from experience or mistakes in life since they lack any sense of past or future, and are not able to genuinely care about other people. People with Haltlose are also called an unstable psychopath.

It is studied in psychiatry, sociology and criminology - and is one of the most common types of psychopathy to end up committing crimes, including violence and murder. Healthier individuals may still focus on either vengeance or sadism. Parents with Haltlose make up the majority of those who sexually molest their own children.

The disorder has many things in common with anti-social personality disorder and borderline personality disorder (BPD). In some countries, doctors diagnose BPD to describe two sets of behaviors, but doctors in other countries diagnose the one group as BPD and the other group as Haltlose, or some people might have both. Usually people with Haltlose will also have other mental illnesses, such as histrionic personality disorder narcissistic personality disorder or fantasy prone personality. 

Sometimes doctors will make a mistake and think it is bipolar. It can also look like epilepsy if combined with alcoholism.

It can be very difficult for a doctor to help them become better since they tend to lie to doctors because they are afraid, and their pathological lying can be convincing even though they view it similar to a child and often believe they should be rewarded for having taken the time to invent such a good lie.

Of all the different types of psychiatric patients, those with Haltlose personality disorder have some of the worst results.

The Haltlose will usually need boundaries and controls set by those around them, and "optimistic" professionals suggest that marriage to a spouse willing to curtail their behaviors may be sufficient to avoid professional involvement. Their symptoms get worse if they are given independence, whether at home, work or in a prison or hospital.

CATEGORIES: Proposed NASA space probes, Cosmic background radiation, Big Bang, Physical cosmology

The Dark Ages Radio Explorer (DARE) mission is a lunar orbiter concept which will be used to identify the coming redshift from first hydrogen atoms just as the first stars began to produce light. DARE will use the redshifted 21-cm transition line from neutral hydrogen (1420.00 MHz emissions) to view and spot the formation of the first glowing objects of the universe.

Also, this is the period ending of the Dark Ages of the universe.  The orbiter will explore the universe as it was from around 80 million years to 420 million years after the Big Bang. The mission will deliver data of the formation of the first stars, the beginning of black hole accretions, and the reionization of the universe. Computer models of galaxy formation will also be tested.

This mission might also add research on dark matter decay. The DARE program will also provide information for developing and deploying lunar surface telescopes that add to exoplanet exploration of nearby stars. It is expected to launch in either 2021 or 2022.

Royal Order of the Crown of Rwanda (Ikamba in the native Kinyarwandan language),  the second-highest, non-religious, decoration/order for merit in the  De jure Kingdom of Rwanda. It is the inheritor of ancient pagan tradition (the Gucana Uruti) envisioned by H.M. King Mutara III of Rwanda in 1950 and it was formally instituted by his successor, Kigeli V, in 1959.

This distinction granted the honoree the right to be treated as a member of the family of the reigning king. The decorated hero that had undergone Gucana Uruti was allowed to wear the crown of the Mwami (King) when the Mwami was seated and not using it.

The Order may be granted as a hereditary award or as a non-hereditary honor. Nobility is conferred upon the grantee. 

There are three ranks in the Order. The highest is the Grand Collar, followed by the Grand Cross, and the lowest rank is Commander. A recipient at the ranks of Grand Collar or Grand Cross is entitled to the style of “Son Excellence”. A recipient at the rank of Commander is entitled to the style of “L’honorable”.

The original recipient was H.M. Baudouin the King of the Belgians gifted by H.M. King Mutara III in 1950. This gift was a physical precedent for the Order, and it was also a prelude to its official introduction years later.

The order has been rarely awarded by the last sovereign ruler of Rwanda HM Kigeli V and the most notable recipients include, among others, the socialist/communist affiliation leaders like Nobel prize winner and the former president of South Africa Nelson Mandela (the rank of Grand Cross, 1999) and the first Prime Minister of the independent Democratic Republic of the Congo (then Republic of the Congo) Patrice Lumumba (posthumously handed over to the family, the rank of Grand Cross, 1966).

[[Big Rip]]

CATEGORIES: Cosmology, Time

In physical cosmology, the Big Rip is a hypothetical cosmological model which describes the ultimate fate of the universe. According to this theory all the matter of the universe from stars and galaxies to atoms and subatomic particles, and even spacetime itself will be torn apart by the expansion of the universe at a certain time in the future, until distances between particles will become infinite. According to the standard model of cosmology the scale factor of the universe is known to be accelerating and, in the future era it will increase more rapidly. However, this expansion is similar for every moment of time (hence the exponential law – the expansion of a local volume is the same number of times over the same time interval), and is identified by an unchanging, small Hubble constant which is ignored by any bound material structures. Similarly in the Big Rip scenario the Hubble constant increases to infinity in a finite time.

The possibility of sudden rip singularity occurs only for hypothetical matter (phantom energy) but it is unlikely to occur in physical properties.

[[Survival sex]]

CATEGORIES: Social issues, Poverty, Prostitution

People who are very poor and who cannot even cover their basic needs, such as getting a place where they live, or food, sometimes trade sexual intercourse to cover these needs. This practice is called survival sex. The term is used by sex trade, poverty researchers, and aid workers.  Very often, people who engage in survival sex are homeless. Sometimes, survival sex is used to get illegal drugs. 

Survival sex is common throughout the world. It has been studied in many countries including the United States, Canada, Mexico, the Philippines, Thailand, New Zealand, Colombia, Kenya, Uganda, and South Africa.

Researchers estimate that of homeless youth in North America, one in three has engaged in survival sex. In one study of homeless youth in Los Angeles, about one-third of females and half of males said they had engaged in survival sex. People who have been homeless for a longer time, who have become victims, or who have become criminals are more likely to engage in survival sex. This is also true for people who have attempted suicide, who are pregnant, or those who have a STI.

Survival sex is common in refugee camps. In Uganda, 1.4 million civilians have been displaced by conflicts between Ugandan government forces and the militant Lord's Resistance Army. Many of them live in refugee camps in northern Uganda. Human Rights Watch reported in 2005 that displaced women and girls in these camps were engaging in survival sex with other camp residents, local defense personnel, and Ugandan government soldiers.

[[Pampas cat]]

CATEGORIES: Felines, Mammals of South America

The pampas cat or gato de las pampas (Leopardus pajeros or Leopardus colocolo) is a small wild cat that lives in the Andes mountain range.  They live in Argentina, Chile, Bolivia, Peru, Uruguay, Brazil, Ecuador, and Colombia.  Some scientists think this cat is really three species, L. colocolo, L. braccatus, and L. pajeros. Other scientists think they are all one species.

This cat lives in many kinds of habitats: cloud forests, swamps, scrublands, and grasslands.

This cat mostly eats small rodents such as guinea pigs and mice, but they also catch birds, for example flamingoes.  Scientists saw pampas cats going to penguin nests to eat eggs and baby penguins.  Farmers say that this cat can kill goats and chickens.

In most of the countries where the pampas cat lives, it is illegal to kill one.  The pampas cat is in danger of dying out because humans are using or want to use the land that it lives on for farms.   Indigenous people of the South America like the pampas cat because it is a sign of fertility and they believe killing a pampas cat brings bad luck.  But the same people also like to have a dead pampas cat's skin or whole body for ceremonies.

This cat's body is 42 to 79 cm long and its tail is another 22 to 33 cm long.  It can weigh 3 to 4 kg.  Its fur is thick and long.  It can be pale yellow to dark gray-brown or dark dull red in color.  It can have stripes or spots or not.  It almost always has rings on its legs and tail.

The first visual recordings of the pampas cat, a movie and photos, were made in 2006.

[[Trace radioisotope]]

CATEGORIES: Chemical elements, Radiometric dating

A trace radioisotope is a radioactive isotope of an element which exists naturally in tiny amounts (i.e. traces). Generally speaking, trace radioisotopes have half-lives much shorter than the age of the Earth.

Trace radioisotopes occur in the atmosphere and the crust of the Earth. They are constantly produced by natural processes such as cosmic ray fission: high-energy cosmic ray striking atoms and causing them to split into smaller nuclei). 

Another mechanism is neutron capture in uranium ores causing the production of nuclei such as uranium-236 and plutonium-239, which are both radioactive isotopes. Spontaneous fission and alpha decay of heavy nuclei such as thorium and uranium also produce radioisotopes in traces as their intermediate decay products.

[[Net run rate]]

CATEGORIES: Cricket, Sports words

Net run rate (NRR) is a number used in cricket to decide which of two teams is better, if both teams are equal on points gotten from winning games during a competition (i.e. they may have won and lost an equal number of games during a World Cup). It is calculated using the difference between the number of runs scored by a team and its opponents, while dividing each of these by the number of legal deliveries (in batches of 6 i.e. the number of overs) that team and its opponents have each batted throughout all of the games involving that team in the competition. This calculation does not look at how many times each team's batsmen have gotten out, so it gives teams that score many runs very quickly an advantage even if they have more batsmen get out than their opponents.

As an example, if a team wins a game 300 runs to 200, with it having batted 200 legal deliveries (33.2 overs, meaning 33 overs and 2 deliveries, or 33 overs plus a third of an over) and its opponents having batted 185 legal deliveries (30.5 overs), then the team's Net Run Rate during that game is (6*((300/200)-(200/185)))= 2.51.

[[Magnon]]

CATEGORIES: Quantum mechanics, Magnetism

A magnon in physics is a quasiparticle with magnetic properties. It is not a  thing which exists on its own   in free space but exists only within the structure being studied  usually a crystalline solid.

Each atom in a solid has a magnetic field generated by its electrons as they spin. If these  spins all align then the solid becomes magnetic at the bulk everyday level. Usually they do not align and the magnetic field of individual atoms cancel each other out. 

Individual atoms can have their spin reversed by interaction with energy from elsewhere. A spin reversal itself  can influence the spin of the electrons in neighbouring atoms.  A wave of change in electron spins can then move through the electrons in the crystal lattice as it dissipates like waves on a pool of water.  Since the electrons are very small and governed by quantum mechanics, this wave, can be treated as though it is a number of particle like entities. These are magnetic quasi particles or magnons.

The Cambridge Spy Ring was a group of spies in the United Kingdom that passed information to the Soviet Union during and after World War II. It was active from the later 1930s until at least into the early 1950s. 

None was ever prosecuted for spying. The number and membership of the ring became public slowly, since the 1950s. Their most damaging achievement was to pass information about the Manhattan Project to the Soviet Union.

The sudden flight of Donald Maclean (cryptonym: Homer) and Guy Burgess (cryptonym: Hicks) to the Soviet Union in 1951 was the first public news. 

In 1961, defector Anatoliy Golitsyn provided information which pointed to Kim Philby. Philby (cryptonyms: Sonny, Stanley), fled the country in 1963. He spent the rest of his life in Moscow.

After Philby's flight, British intelligence got confessions from Anthony Blunt (cryptonyms: Tony, Johnson) and then John Cairncross (cryptonym: Liszt), who were the last two of a group of five. Their involvement was kept secret for many years: until 1979 for Blunt, and 1990 for Cairncross.  

The group became known as the Cambridge Five. All five spies met as students or teachers at Cambridge University.

[[Cooper pair]]

CATEGORIES: Physics

A Cooper pair is a pair of free electrons within a solid that act together as one quasiparticle and in large numbers  give rise to superconductivity.

Physicists explain superconductivity by describing what happens when temperatures get cold. The thermal energy in a solid or liquid shakes the atoms so they randomly vibrate, but this gets less as the temperature drops. Electrons carry the same negative electric charge which makes them repel each other. At higher temperatures each unbound electron behaves as if it were a free particle. There is also however a very weak attraction between electrons when they are in any solid or liquid. This is due to the way bound electrons distort the spacing of the atomic structure they find themselves in. At relatively rather large distances (many hundreds of nanometers apart) and low temperatures (near absolute zero), the attractive effect and lack of thermal energy allows pairs of electrons to hang together. This is called a cooper pair and it is a quasiparticle, that is it acts as if it were a new kind of particle in its own right even though it is made up of two fundamental electrons. 

Many overlapping cooper pairs can exist in the same nanometer sized space. Since paired electrons constitute a boson the motions of all of the cooper pairs within a single superconductor synchronise and they function as if they are a single entity. This is known as the Bose–Einstein condensation. The Cooper pairs  form this condensate, which is superfluid or super-conducting.  Small disturbances such as scattering of electrons are forbidden in this state  as long as the temperature remains low.  It moves as one showing no resistance to its motion. It is hence now a superconductor.

[[Happiness pump]]

CATEGORIES: Philosophy

A happiness pump is an idea in philosophy.  A happiness pump is someone who will do anything to make other people happy even if it makes them very unhappy themselves.  They have turned themselves into a machine (a "pump") that makes happiness.

The happiness pump is a way of showing problems in utilitarianism.  Utilitarianism is a moral philosophy.  It is a way of deciding which actions are good and which are bad.  In utilitarianism, actions that make more happiness or stop pain are good.  Actions that stop happiness or make pain are bad.  In utilitarianism, it does not matter who is becoming happier or feeling less pain.  That means that, in utilitarianism, helping strangers is good.  The happiness pump is a person who has taken utilitarianism too far and will give themselves lots of pain so long as they believe it makes other people somewhere in the world much happier.

The happiness pump is only an idea.  Philosopher Joshua David Greene says it is almost impossible to be a happiness pump for real.  People who even tried would give up.

The 2021 Atlantic hurricane season is an ongoing Atlantic hurricane season, which is part of the annual tropical cyclone season in the Northern Hemisphere. It officially began on June 1, 2021, and will end on November 30, 2021. These dates, adopted by convention, historically describe the period in each year when most Atlantic tropical cyclones form. However, tropical cyclogenesis is possible at any time of the year, as demonstrated by the early formation of Subtropical Storm Ana on May 22, making 2021 the seventh consecutive year that a storm formed before the official start of the season. In June 3 named storms formed during the month making June 2021 the most active June since 1968 and also tied with 1886, 1909, and 1936.

Starting this season, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began to issue regular Tropical Weather Outlooks on May 15, two weeks earlier than it did in the past. This change was implemented in light of the fact that named systems had formed in the Atlantic Ocean prior to the official start of the season in each of the preceding six seasons.

It was popularised by John Dobson in 1965. It increased the size of telescopes for amateur astronomers. Dobson's telescopes had a simplified mechanical design that was easy to make from readily available components. It made a large, portable, low-cost telescope. 

The design works for looking at faint, deep-sky objects such as nebulae and galaxies. This type of observation needs a large objective diameter (i.e. light-gathering power) of relatively short focal length. It can be taken to less light-polluted places.

The last glacial maximum (LGM) was about 27,000 to 24,000 years ago. The Younger Dryas was the most recent and longest of several interruptions to the gradual warming of the Earth's climate. The change was relatively sudden, and it resulted in a decline of temperatures in Greenland by 4 to 10 °C (7.2 to 18 °F) Glaciers and dry conditions spread over much of the temperate Northern Hemisphere. It may have been caused by an influx of fresh, cold water from North America to the Atlantic.

[[George Smiley]]

CATEGORIES: Fictional British people, Characters in written fiction, Fictional characters introduced in 1961

George Smiley OBE is a fictional character created by John le Carré. Smiley is an intelligence officer with "The Circus". This is the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS), commonly known as MI6. 

He is a central character in the novels Call for the Dead, A Murder of Quality, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, The Honourable Schoolboy, and Smiley's People, and a supporting character in The Spy Who Came In from the Cold, The Looking Glass War, The Secret Pilgrim and A Legacy of Spies. The character has also appeared in a number of film, television, and radio adaptations of le Carré's books.

Le Carré, who created Smiley, wanted to show that Ian Fleming's James Bond series was an inaccurate picture of espionage life. Smiley is polite, shy and humble. He often allows others to mistreat him, especially his unfaithful wife. But his humility masks his inner cunning, excellent memory, mastery of tradecraft, and occasional ruthlessness. His genius being underestimated helps Smiley achieve his goals. In the end, he becomes one of the most powerful agents in Britain.

The character is held in high esteem in Britain, where he has become a pop-culture icon on par with Bond. The Guardian called him "the sort of spy Britain believes it ought to have: a bit shabby, academic, basically loyal, and sceptical of...  his political masters".

[[Names of Vietnam]]

CATEGORIES: History of Vietnam

Throughout history of Vietnam, besides official names, there are names that are used unofficially to refer to the territory of Vietnam. Vietnam was ever called Văn Lang during the Hùng Vương Dynasty, Âu Lạc when An Dương was king, Nam Việt during the Triệu Dynasty, Van Xuan during the Anterior Lý Dynasty, Đại Cồ Việt during the Đinh dynasty and Early Lê dynasty. Starting in 1054, Vietnam was called Đại Việt (Great Viet). During the Hồ dynasty, Vietnam was called Đại Ngu.

Việt Nam (Vietnam.ogg in Vietnamese) is a variation of Nam Việt (Southern Việt), a name that can be traced back to the Triệu dynasty (2nd century BC, also known as Nanyue Kingdom). The word "Việt" originated as a shortened form of Bách Việt, a word used to refer to a people who lived in what is now southern China in ancient times. The word "Việt Nam", with the syllables in the modern order, first appears in the 16th century in a poem by Nguyễn Bỉnh Khiêm. "Annam", which originated as a Chinese name in the seventh century, was the common name of the country during the colonial period. Nationalist writer Phan Bội Châu revived the name "Vietnam" in the early 20th century. When rival communist and anti-communist governments were set up in 1945, both immediately adopted this as the country's official name. In English, the two syllables are usually combined into one word, "Vietnam". However, "Viet Nam" was once common usage and is still used by the United Nations and by the Vietnamese government.

[[Regulations for the Order and Discipline of the Troops of the United States]]

CATEGORIES: American Revolutionary War, Books

The Regulations for the Order and Discipline of the Troops of the United States or Blue Book is an American army book from the Revolutionary War.  It is about how to teach soldiers to be good soldiers.  Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben wrote the first version in 1777 and 1778 at Valley Forge. George Washington, Alexander Hamilton and other officers in the Continental Army helped.  Von Steuben rewrote the book a year later.

At Valley Forge in the winter of 1777-1778, Acting Inspector General von Steuben saw that many Continental officers gave their men different drills. Drills are practice exercises.  Using different drills meant the men might become confused in a real battle.  Von Steuben wrote new drills for the whole army.  He wrote them French.  His aide-de-camp, Pierre Ettienne Duponceau, and George Washington's aides-de-camp, Alexander Hamilton and John Laurens rewrote them in English.  General George Washington would read the drills and make changes. They gave each lesson to the officers one at a time.  Then the officers or their helpers made their own copies.  Then van Steuben and the officers would use the drills with the men.

The next year, in Philadelphia, von Steuben wrote down his Valley Forge drills in one book.  He wrote it in French.  Lieutenant Colonel Francois de Fleury helped.  Then Captain Benjamin Walker and Duponceu rewrote the book in English.  Captain Pierre Charles L'Enfant drew the pictures.

Congress decided to use the book starting in 1779.  The American military used the Blue Book until 1814.

[[Class consciousness]]

CATEGORIES: Marxism, Society

In Marxism, class consciousness is one's awareness (consciousness) of where one belongs in a system of social classes.

According to Marx, there are two classes in capitalism. They are the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. The bourgeoisie take advantage of the proletariat and control the means of production. The proletariat class has more people than the bourgeoisie but do not own the means of production. The proletariat are usually workers.

According to Marxism, many members of the proletariat class have false consciousness. That means they usually think about themselves and are not aware of the class struggle going on in society or how the proletariat is being hurt by the bourgeoisie. An example of false consciousness would be the idea of the American Dream.

When enough members of the proletariat have class consciousness, they will be able to unite and overthrow the capitalist system.

The man who fatally shot all three women to death, Willis Mark Haynes, was sentenced to life plus 45 years, while Higgs, who was in a vehicle when the killings took place, received a death sentence.

Higgs was scheduled for execution by lethal injection on January 15, 2021. He was executed on January 16 at the USP Terre Haute in Terre Haute, Indiana at the age of 48.

Ethnography started in social and cultural anthropology in the early twentieth century. It spread to other social sciences, especially sociology.

The best way to use ethnography with quantitative research is to discover relationships. Then, use the results and data to test and explain empirical assumptions.

The word ethnography comes from Greek words ἔθνος ethnos "folk, people, nation" and γράφω grapho "I write")

[[Brestskaya Gazeta]]

CATEGORIES: 2002 establishments in Europe, Newspapers in Belarus, Websites, Censorship in Belarus

Brestskaya Gazeta (Брестская газета) is a non-governmental newspaper from Brest, Belarus. Its first number came on November 18, 2002. The main language of the newspaper and its website is Russian, but some stories are written in Belarusian. Its latest number came on December 30, 2020.

It has been writing about the 2020 Belarusian protests and 2020 Belarusian presidential election, so several journalists of the Brest newspaper have been tried and arrested for that.

In October 2020, the newspaper joined a common statement by the Belarusian Association of Journalists and private media companies on the troubles of TUT.BY and limits on the use of private websites. The newspaper took a strong civil position against violence in writing about the Belarusian protests. The newspaper started buying and sending its copies to political prisoners. Brestskaya Gazeta printed their answers to its letters in prisons.

In late November, it became known that the Brest Regional Printing House, where the newspaper had been printed for 18 years, had said no to printing it starting 2021 for no reason; the fax was signed by Vyacheslav Shakhlevich, chief of the printing house.

The United Mass Media requested Shakhlevich, the Brest City and Regional Executive Committees, and the Ministry of Information to make possible to change the decision that created "troubles for the well liked private regional publication." Chief of the Belarusian Association of Journalists Andrei Bastunets said that the troubles made to Brestskaya Gazeta support the government' pressure on the regional news media, as "the fact that this is happening at the level of economic objects should make anyone foolish."

To stay away from punishment for not made transportation, it was chosen in time to give up on Belposhta's (Belpost (Белпошта), Belarusian postal service) subscription services for the first part of 2021. On January 19, 2021, it became known that Brestskaya Gazeta has stopped to be made for now. All printing houses in Belarus had made decisions not to print the newspaper.

On July 8, 2021, the office and the houses of its main people were looked for. Two days later Brestskaya Gazeta said that all the technical devices (computers. smartphones and tools like that) of its people were taken away.
