The fringed tree frog, Lönnberg's tree frog or green-eyed frog (Ranoidea eucnemis) is a frog from New Guinea and Australia. Scientists saw it on the Huon Peninsula and parts of the Cape York Peninsula in Queensland.

This frog lives in rainforests.  It lives near streams with many rocks in them.  It lays eggs during the spring and summer, 800-900 at a time.  The female frog lays eggs in clumps.  The tadpoles can swim well in the fast water.  They become frogs after 60-80 days.

This frog is not endangered now, but some of the things that humans do are bad for it.  Years ago, taking trees for wood meant there was less forest for the frogs to live in.  Now, the biggest dangers to the frogs are things that make their water worse, like grazing.

[[Adventure game]]

CATEGORIES: Types of video games, Video game genres

An adventure game is a type of video game or computer game.  Gameplay in adventure games is mostly exploration, solving puzzles and finishing stories.  Some adventure games also have combat systems so the player can fight enemies like in an action game, beat 'em up or role-playing game, but many adventure games have no fighting in them at all.  The first adventure game was Colossal Cave Adventure in 1975.

In adventure games, the player usually acts through a character in the story.  This character sometimes has a history. For example Roger Sams in Bad Mojo is a sad insect scientist and Alexander in King's Quest VI is a prince trying to rescue a princess.  Other player characters have almost no history.  In Myst and Zork, the game does not even give the player character a name.  Other characters and the game's voice call the player "you."

Adventure games can be played on computers, for example PCs and Macs.  Adventure games can be played on consoles, for example Playstations and Xboxes.

Many adventure games are called point-and-click adventure games because the player uses a computer mouse to click on things on the screen.  Not all adventure games do this.  In the 1996 game Bad Mojo, the player can only use the computer's arrow keys.  In the 1977 game Zork, the player must write commands using the keyboard.

Because they are about exploration, adventure games usually have an interesting world setting.  Some games have art with painted graphics.  Others show off the newest image-making technology, for example Myst.  Other games, like the early Zork games, had no graphics at all.  The Zork games told the player what was happening using words.

Some famous adventure game series are Myst by Brøderbund, Monkey Island by LucasArts, and the King's Quest and Quest for Glory series by Sierra on-line.

Batter is thin dough that can be easily poured into a pan. Batter is used mainly for pancakes, light cakes and as the coating for some fried foods. The word batter comes from a French word battre. Battre means beat. Many batters require vigorous beating or whisking in their preparation.

A number of batters are made by combining dry flour with liquids, like eggs, milk and water. Often, a leavening agent such as baking powder is included to fluff up the batter while it cooks. The mixture may be naturally fermented for this actual purpose, as well as to add flavor.

The viscosity of batter may be from very 'heavy" to "thin". Heat is applied to the batter, often by frying, baking or steaming in order to cook the ingredients and to "set" the batter in a solid form.

On March 13, 1964, 28-year-old Kitty Genovese was mugged and stabbed to death outside the apartment building on Austin Street, in the Kew Gardens neighborhood of Queens in New York City, United States. 

Two weeks after the murder, The New York Times published an article claiming that 38 witnesses saw or heard the attack, and that none of them called the police or came to her aid, that witness as Sophia Farrar.

The incident was the bystander effect or "Genovese syndrome," and the murder became a well known example of U.S. psychology textbooks. Genovese syndrome is when witnesses to a crime to not report a crime because they are scared and they believe that others will report it instead which in the end they do not and the crime goes unreported. 

However, this is not really what happened.  Police interviews showed that the other people nearby either attempted to call the police or were afraid to be involved.  This was before calling 911 was easy to do in the United States.  Because Genovese was killed late at night, many of the people nearby were asleep.  Some of the people who saw the attack also saw Genovese get up and walk away, so they did not think she had been badly hurt.

Winston Moseley, a 29-year-old man from Manhattan, was arrested during a house burglary six days after the murder. While in custody, he confessed to killing Genovese. At his trial, Moseley was found guilty. Moseley died in prison on March 28, 2016.

[[Alcoholics Anonymous]]

CATEGORIES: Organizations

Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is an international mutual aid fellowship. Its purpose is to help alcoholics quit drinking and help people stay sober. AA gives men and women a place to come together and share their experiences, recover from alcoholism and maintain sobriety. Its concept revolves around that premise that alcoholism is an illness that can be managed, but not controlled.

AA was founded by Bill Wilson and his physician, Doctor Bob Smith in 1935 and eventually grew to include two more groups by 1939. That same year, Wilson published Alcoholics Anonymous, a text which explained its philosophy and methods. We know it today as the 12 Steps of recovery. Over the years, the 12 Steps have been adapted by other self-help and addiction recovery groups, such as Gamblers Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous, to those struggling with other forms of addiction. Additionally, many groups have changed the explicitly Christian overtones of the original 12 Steps to reflect more secular or agnostic philosophies.

[[Sarah Baartman]]

CATEGORIES: 1780s births, 1815 deaths, South African people, Anthropology

Sarah Baartman (born around 1789, died 29th December 1815)  was a Khoikoi woman from South Africa, who came to great fame in Europe. Her name is also spelled Bartman or Bartmann. She showed signs of Steatopygia; which means she had a lot of fat in her buttocks. Around 1810, she was brought to Europe.  She was one of at least two Khoikoi women, who were shown at freak shows.   In English she became known as Hottentot Venus. At the time, people believed there were different races of humans. Hottentot was the term used to refer to the Khoikoi people, as a race. Today, many consider it to be racist. 

From about 1810, Baartman performed for upper-class people in London. She danced, sang and played an instrument, called Ramkie.  The Ramkie is a kind of lute with 3 or 4 chords that was popular in South Africa at the time. The African Institution, led by Zachary Macaulay offered to bring Sarah Baaerman back to South Africa, but she declined. It is unknown if she was put under pressure, or if she declined because in South Africa her people were persecuted (much like a modern-day genocide). She may also have liked the performances. There was a court hearing, done in Dutch; there she said that she wasn't forced to do anything.  She also said that she had been promised half the earnings from her show. 

The court hearing had drawn too much attention, and she could no longer perform in London. Hendrick Caezar, her manager at the time, moved to the English countryside, with his "freak." Reverend Joshua Brooks baptized her on December 1, 1811, in a church in Manchester. In 1814. she came to Paris with another manager. There, mostly scientists were interested. She was presented to the audience, mostly of doctors and scientists, in the Jardin des Plantes, in Paris. Professional portraits were done. She died, presumably of pneumonia, on December 29, 1815. 

Georges Cuvier prepared her corpse: The skeleton, the brain, and her genitals were preserved. A gypsum plaster model was made of her body. All of these are preserved in what is the Musée de l'Homme in Paris, today.

Stephen Jay Gould and Élisabeth de Fontenay pointed out that these exhibitions were sexist, and focused on their own people ("ethnocenric"), in 1982. President Nelson Mandela asked that the remains of Sarah Baartman be given back to South Africa. At first, French academics refused. It was only in 2002, that her remains were given back. There was a large funeral in Hankey at the River Gamtoos in the area of  Baviaanskloof, on 9. August 2002. Thabo Mbeki, who was the president of South Africa at the time, gave the funeral speech. The district Cacadu, where her grave is was renamed to Sarah Baartman, in her honor, in 2015.

[[Green-eyed tree frog]]

CATEGORIES: Animals of Australia, Frogs, Animals of Asia, Animals of Oceania

The green-eyed tree frog, brown-spotted tree frog, fringed tree frog or New Guinea tree frog (Ranoidea genimaculata)  is a tree frog from New Guinea.  It lives everywhere on the island except high in the mountains. It lives in both Papua New Guinea and Indonesia, no more than 1500 meters above sea level. It also lives in Queensland, Australia, near the Great Barrier Reef, but some scientists think these are really two different species.  Scientists who think they are one species call the frogs in New Guinea and Australia Litoria genimaculata and scientists who think they are two different species call the New Guinea frogs genimaculata and the Australian frogs serrata. Some scientists think the group of frogs in Australia is really two different species, serrata and myola, for three altogether.

The adult male frog is 4.6 cm long and the adult female frog is 7.1 cm long. Each frog has a bright green ring around its eyes, which is why it is called "green-eyed tree frog" in English.  It has a brown-green body with patches of color that look like lichen that grows on wet rocks.  That way, the frog can hide from larger animals that want to eat it. The frog has very large discs on its toes for climbing.  This frog has a bit of skin on its hind legs that looks like fringe.  That is why it is also called "fringed tree frog" in English.

This frog lives near streams with rocks in them.  The male frogs tend to stay near the water, and the female frogs climb high into the trees.  The female frog lays eggs in pools, many hundreds at a time.

This frog has colors that look like an hourglass on its back.  Scientists thought they could take photographs of this frog to identify individual frogs, but the hourglass changes shape as the frog grows older.

This frog is not endangered now, but scientists think the fungal disease chytridiomycosis or a virus may have killed many of them.

[[Quasiparticle]]

CATEGORIES: Basic physics ideas, Quantum mechanics, Subatomic particles

The term Quasiparticle describes a concept in physics in which energetically excited states in matter are treated as though they are elementary quantum particles in their own right.  In fact they may be something less tangible like a vibration or a rotation.

Unlike neutrons, protons, or even atoms and molecules, quasiparticles aren't independent structures floating about on their own in free space but exist only within the structure  being studied. 

For the purposes of modelling the behaviour of the excited  state within the structure  this treatment works very well.  

As the particles emerge from more fundamental structures they are called quasi-particles or quasiparticles.

These particles have in most cases short  lifetimes, like the magnon or the exciton. But there are also some quasi-particles with an infinite lifetime like the cooper-pair in superconductors.

[[Pteropus]]

CATEGORIES: Bats, Mammals of Australia, Mammals of Asia

Pteropus is a genus of large megabats. They are commonly known as fruit bats or flying foxes. They live in the tropics and subtropics of Asia:  Australia,  the Indian subcontinent, East Africa, and some oceanic islands in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. 

There are at least 60 living species in the genus.

Flying foxes eat fruit and other plant matter, and occasionally  insects as well. They find food with their keen sense of smell. Most, but not all, are nocturnal. They navigate with keen eyesight, as they cannot echolocate. They have long lives and low birth rates.  Females of most species have only one offspring each year. This slow birth rate makes their populations vulnerable in present-day circumstances.

Like other bats, flying foxes can give deadly diseases to humans. They are the reservoirs of rare but fatal disease agents such as Australian bat lyssavirus (which causes rabies), and Hendra virus. Seven known human deaths have come from these two diseases. Nipah virus is also transmitted by flying foxes—it affects more people, with over 100 fatalities. 

Flying foxes have cultural significance to indigenous people. They appear in traditional art, folklore, and weaponry. Their fur and teeth were used as currency in the past. Some cultures still use their teeth as currency today.

[[Measure word]]

CATEGORIES: Parts of speech

A measure word is a word or morpheme (the smallest meaningful unit in a language) that shows how much of something there is.

In English, measure words are used to show amounts of something that cannot be easily counted, also called uncountable nouns or mass nouns. For example, a person cannot usually say, "I have three gasolines", since gasoline is not easy to count. However, a person can measure how much gasoline there is or count how many containers are used to hold gasoline. In other words, people can say, "I have three gallons of gasoline", "I have three liters of gasoline", or "I have three tanks of gasoline."

In English, count nouns are their own measure words. A person can say "I have three cars" or "cars have four wheels". The nouns do not need any extra words because the nouns themselves are easy to count. Measure words can also be used to describe groups of countable nouns. For example, a group of cattle is called "a herd of cattle" and a group of fish is called "a school of fish."

In many East Asian languages, like Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, measure words must be used to count both mass nouns and count nouns. Unlike in English, a person cannot simply say "three cars" or "four wheels" in Chinese. The nouns in both phrases need a measure word. In Chinese a person must say "three (vehicle) car" (三辆车) and "four (thing) wheel" (四个轮).

Foot wrote about the trolley problem and other problems in her 1967 essay "The Problem of Abortion and the Doctrine of the Double Effect."

[[Jungguy frog]]

CATEGORIES: Frogs, Animals of Australia

The jungguy frog (Ranoidea jungguy) is a tree frog from Australia.  It lives in Queensland.

This frog lives in rainforests near the Barron River and east to the Mirray River.  Some of these frogs also live near the Broken River.

The adult male frog is 3.1 to 4.8 cm long and the adult female frog is 4.4 to 7.1 cm long.  This frog is light brown with darker brown marks.    Some males turn partially yellow during the time of year when they try to attract females.    The front feet have no webbing and large discs for climbing.

In some places, this frog digs a small basin to lay eggs in.  The tadpoles stay in this basin until they become frogs.  The frog digs the basin in sandy ground where the sunlight comes through the trees.  The frog digs the basin close enough to a stream for water to seep through the sand into the basin.  In some species, a male frog digs a basin to impress a female so she will mate with him, but scientists think male jungguy frogs attract a female first and then dig the basin.

Scientists used to think this was the same frog as Litoria lesueuri.

[[Battle of Singapore]]

CATEGORIES: Pacific battles of World War II, 20th century in Singapore, 1942

The Battle of Singapore was a battle of World War II from 8 to 15 February, 1942. The British army of 85,000 men was led by Lieutenant General Arthur Percival, while the Japanese regiment of 36,000 men was headed by Lieutenant General Tomoyuki Yamashita. Japan captured the British naval base in Singapore, built as a protectionary agent for dominions in the Pacific. Japan defeated the inadequate forces at Singapore, allowing the Imperial Japanese forces to move further south in its war against the Allied powers. The defeat of the "Singapore Strategy" meant that thousands of British and Australian POW's were taken.

At the beginning of December 1941, on the same day that Japan was attacking Pearl Harbour half a world away, the Japanese simultaneously bombed the Royal Air Force bases to the north of Singapore on the Malay coast, thereby eliminating the Air Force’s ability to either retaliate or protect the occupying troops on the ground. Their tactics were shrewd and incredibly well thought out. Before a Japanese soldier set foot on Singaporean soil, Britain’s naval and aerial capabilities had both been destroyed.

The worst defeat in the history of British arms, the Battle of Singapore and the preceding Malayan Campaign saw Percival's command suffer around 7,500 killed, 10,000 wounded, and 120,000 captured. Japanese losses in the fighting for Singapore numbered around 1,713 killed and 2,772 wounded. While some of the British and Australian prisoners were kept at Singapore, thousands more were shipped to Southeast Asia for use as forced labor on projects such as the Siam–Burma (Death) Railway and Sandakan airfield in North Borneo.

Many of the Indian troops were recruited into the pro-Japanese Indian National Army for use in the Burma Campaign. Singapore would remain under Japanese occupation for the remainder of the war. During this period, the Japanese massacred elements of the city's Chinese population as well as others who opposed their rule.

CATEGORIES: Mathematics

There are several questions that arise:

In addition, there may be state restrictions. The state the system is in at a given point in time has to meet certain conditions.

[[Operation Moonshot]]

CATEGORIES: COVID-19 pandemic, England, United Kingdom

Operation Moonshot is a programme by the UK government to allow many people in England to be tested for COVID-19 as a way to allow large gatherings of people to happen there while maintaining control over the virus. According to the British Medical Journal, the programme aims to perform 10 million tests per day by 2021.

People are worried about it because, as a leaked government document says, it is thought it may cost £100bn, which is about three-quarters of what the NHS England costs every year. Statisticians say because any test can have inaccuracies, mass testing at this scale might cause hundreds of thousands of false positives a day, resulting in very large numbers of people being told they are infected when they are not infected.

Altersex (composed of alter and sex) is an umbrella term for a different or other possibility referring to primary and secondary sex traits, such as genitalia and gonads, phenotype and genotype (genetics/karyotype), within ones perspective. 

Altersexuality was created to be used on a large scale, but not exclusively, for fictional characters, describing body plans that are a mixture of things, instead of naturally found configurations, such as salmacian (ambigenital or bigenital) or bigonadal (ovotestis).  

A body plan is the type of body parts that someone has or does not have, such as a penis, testicles, a vulva, a developed clitoris and breasts, similar to transsexuality in these cases, altersexuals can get sex reassignment surgery, also popularly known as change of sex, such as (vulvo)vaginoplasty, phalloplasty, methoidioplasty or (peno)scrotoplasty. However altersexo is a type category of any body plane outside the conventional standard, including those that are fantastic or imaginary and, or physiologically not possible in real life or in the homo sapiens species. 

The word has been adopted by transgender people in gender non-conformity, as they do not belong to the dyadic/dualistic and cissexual pattern of endosex (non- intersex or perisex), making it an alternative to denote dissent towards sex cisnormative classifications biological and anatomical, constantly socialized by identity genres.

[[Identity document]]

CATEGORIES: Migration, Authentication methods, Official documents of the United States, Documents

An identity  document is any document that may be used to prove a person's identity. If issued in a small, standard credit card size form, it is usually called an identity card (IC, ID card, citizen card) or passport card. Some countries issue formal identity documents as national identification cards.

Many countries require all foreigners to have a passport or national identity card from their home country available at all times if they do not have a residence permit in the country.

The shape and size of identity cards were standardized in 1985 by ISO/IEC 7810. Some modern identity documents are smart cards including a difficult-to-forge embedded integrated circuit that were standardized in 1988 by ISO/IEC 7816. New technologies allow identity cards to contain biometric information, such as a photograph; face, hand, or iris measurements; or fingerprints. Many countries now issue electronic identity cards.

Identity cards allow officials to look up security data on a person in the host country's information system. Photos of the person's head are scanned into the system to prevent identity theft. A scanned photograph of the face gives a unique series of numbers which identifies that particular individual.

The earliest identity document was written into law by King Henry V of England with the Safe Conducts Act 1414. For the next 500 years and before World War I, most people did not have or need an identity document.

[[Ignatius Sancho]]

Ignatius Sancho was an African born around 1729 on a slave ship. Towards the end of his extraordinary life, he became a British citizen and was eligible to vote in the parliamentary election of 1774, and then again in 1780.

The details of his early life are not certain. He was born on a slave ship crossing the Atlantic. The ship went to the Spanish colonies in Central America. His parents did not survive long, and he became orphaned. His owner took him to London, and he eventually came to live with John Montague, 2nd Duke of Montagu and Mary, Duchess of Montagu. Sancho worked as her butler until her death in 1751.

While living at Montague House in Blackheath, he educated himself. He enjoyed music, poetry, reading, and writing.

During the 1760s Sancho married a West Indian woman, Anne Osborne. He became a devoted husband and father. They had seven children. Around the time their third child was born, Sancho became a valet to George Montagu, 1st Duke of Montagu (of the second creation), the son-in-law of his earlier patron. He remained there until 1773.

In 1768 Thomas Gainsborough painted a portrait of Sancho at the same time as the Duchess of Montagu sat for her portrait by the artist. 

In 1774, with Montague's help, he became a shopkeeper in Mayfair. He sold tobacco, sugar and tea, all of which were connected with the slave trade. As a male householder living in Mayfair, he was eligible to vote. He also wrote letters in newspapers, under his own name and under the pseudonym "Africanus". He supported the monarchy and British forces in the American Revolutionary War.

Sancho had many well-known visitors at his shop, including statesman and abolitionist Charles James Fox PC (1749–1806). Fox steered a resolution through Parliament pledging it to abolish the slave trade. A Foreign Slave Trade Bill in Spring 1806 prohibited British subjects from contributing to the trading of slaves with the colonies of Britain's wartime enemies. This cut out two-thirds of the slave trade passing through British ports.

U Škripcu (У Шкрипцу; trans. In Dire Straits) was a Serbian and Yugoslav rock band from Belgrade.

The band was created in 1980 by Zoran Vulović "Vule" (keyboards), Milan Delčić "Delča" (vocals) and Aleksandar Vasiljević "Vasa" (guitar), who later added Miloš Obrenović (drums) and Aleksandar Lukić (bass guitar) to the band, and to change the name of the band to U Škripcu. After the band became successful and popular around Yugoslavia with the release of the album O je! and EP Nove godine!, they failed to repeat this success, and so they disbanded in 1985.

In 1986, Vulović and Delčić re-created the band, but the latter soon left the band, so the new lineup, which included the vocalist Aleksandar Tabaš and various musicians, recorded the fourth studio album, U Škripcu. The album was not successful, so the band disbanded again in 1988. The next year, Vulović reunited with Delčić and Vasiljević, Lukić on guitar, bassist Dejan Škopelja, and drummer Ratko Ljubičić. They recorded the fifth studio album Izgleda da mi smo sami. After this, the band disbanded again. After this, Vulović became a producer and manager, Delčić pursued a solo career with his band Sklekovi, and Vasiljević and Lukić became a part of the supergroup Familija. In 2007, the original lineup came back together at the Delča i Sklekovi concert at the Belgrade Dom Omladine, which was released in 2008 as Ljubilarnih 20 i nešto godina - Live, under the moniker Delča a i U Škripcu.

On June 1, 2020, amid the George Floyd protests in Washington, D.C., law enforcement officers used tear gas and other riot control tactics to forcefully clear peaceful protesters from Lafayette Square.

This was done to create a path for President Donald Trump and senior administration officials to walk from the White House to St. John's Episcopal Church. Trump held up a Bible and posed for a photo shoot in front of Ashburton House (the church's parish house), which had been damaged by a fire during protests the night before.

Former military leaders, current religious leaders, and elected officials from both parties criticized Trump for the event. The event was described by The New York Times as "a burst of violence unlike any seen in the shadow of the White House in generations" and possibly one of the defining moments of the Trump presidency. Joe Biden and some newspapers said that Donald Trump held the Bible upside down, which is not true.

[[Waterfall frog]]

CATEGORIES: Animals of Australia, Frogs

The waterfall frog or torrent tree frog (Ranoidea nannotis) is a frog from Australia. Scientists have seen it between 180 and 1300 metres above sea level.

The adult male frog is 3.2 to 5.2 cm long and the adult female frog is 4.8 to 5.9 cm long.  This frog lives in fast-flowing streams in rainforests and other forests.  It does not only lay its eggs in fast streams.  It spends most of its time in or near the water.  The adult frog is gray or olive on the back with mottling colors and a white belly.  This frog can lay eggs at any time of year.  The female frog lays her eggs underneath rocks.  The tadpoles have strong tails for swimming and mouths on the underside of their bodies so they can hold onto rocks.  Adult frogs hide in the stream or near waterfalls during the day and look for food at night. They usually do not go more than 35 metres away from the water.

This frog eats almost any animal without bones inside that it can fit into its mouth.  It will eat flies, dragonflies, beetles, true bugs, mites, bees, wasps, ants, insect larvae and millipedes.

This frog is endangered.  Scientists think this might be because feral pigs brought to Australia by humans rip up their streams, but they are not sure.  Some scientists looked at whether habitat loss or or chemicals that humans use to kill insects might be killing the frogs, and they found this is probably not what is killing them.  Some scientists think the fungal disease chytridiomycosis could be killing the frogs

It delivers a strong neurotoxin when touched. The small bulb  on the tip of the stinging hairs break off and penetrating the skin, injecting the toxin. It is the most toxic of the Australian  stinging trees. The fruit can be eaten if the stinging hairs that cover it are removed.

Ernie Rider, who was slapped in the face and torso with the foliage in 1963, said:

For two or three days the pain was almost unbearable; I couldn’t work or sleep, then it was pretty bad pain for another fortnight or so. The stinging persisted for two years and recurred every time I had a cold shower. ... There's nothing to rival it; it's ten times worse than anything else.

[[Forests of Azerbaijan]]

CATEGORIES: Forests, Geography of Azerbaijan, Azerbaijan-related lists

The forests of Azerbaijan have 150 endemic species of trees and bushes out of a total of 435 species of trees and bushes.

The total forest area of Azerbaijan is 1,021,880 ha or 11.8% of the country's area. The forest biomes are made up of temperate deciduous forests, temperate mixed deciduous and coniferous forests, temperate coniferous forests and riparian forests. Specialists estimate that in the 8th-9th centuries the forest cover was around 30-35%, most of it is in mountainous areas.

While as a whole, Azerbaijan is a country with modest forest cover, the forest cover is unevenly spread across the country. In the low-lying areas, the forest cover is very sparse, also due to the fact that the precipitation is too low for trees and forests to grow in most of these areas; whereas in many mountainous areas, the forest cover is much greater especially in wetter areas.

49% of the country's forests are located in the Greater Caucasus Mountains, 34% in the Lesser Caucasus Mountains, 15% in the Talysh Mountains-Lankaran Lowland region, 2% in the Kur-Araz Lowland, and 0.5% in the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic.

The forests are classified into two major ecoregions in Azerbaijan: the Caucasus mixed forests of the Greater Caucasus Mountains and the Lesser Caucasus Mountains, and the Caspian Hyrcanian mixed forests of the Talysh Mountains-Lankaran Lowland region.

Azerbaijan has many endemic tree and shrub species, relicts of the Tertiary period which were not affected by Pliocene and Pleistocene glaciations.

Bluey (7 June 1910 – 14 November 1939) was an Australian Cattle Dog. Bluey's owners are Les and Esma Hall from Rochester, Victoria, Australia. Guinness World Records says that Bluey is the oldest known dog. Bluey lived for 29 years and 5 months.

Another dog named Chilla was said to have lived for 32 years. A study was done to see if Australian Cattle Dogs lived longer than other dog breeds. 100 dogs were surveyed. The study showed that Australian Cattle Dogs lived on average for 13.41 years, almost a year longer than other dog breeds. In the end, the study says that Bluey and Chilla should be seen as distinct from other dogs instead of showing longer lives for Australian Cattle Dogs.

Three other dogs named Max, Bella, and Maggie were said by their owners to have lived longer than Bluey. Guinness World Records did not put any of the dogs in their book because the dog owners could not verify that fact.

[[Christmas elf]]

CATEGORIES: Christmas

A Christmas elf is a diminutive elf that lives with Santa Claus at the North Pole and serves as his helper. Christmas elves are often said to wear green or red clad with large, pointy ears and pointy hats. Santa's elves are known to make the toys in Santa's workshop and take care of his reindeer, among other tasks.

The Christmas elf appeared in literature as early as 1850 when Louisa May Alcott completed, but never published a book entitled Christmas Elves. The image of the elves in the workshop was popularized by Godey's Lady's Book, with a front cover illustration for its 1873 Christmas Issue showing Santa surrounded by toys and elves with the caption, "Here we have an idea of the preparations that are made to supply the young folks with toys at Christmas time." During this time, Godey's was immensely influential to the birth of Christmas traditions, having shown the first widely circulated picture of a modern Christmas tree on the front cover of its 1850 Christmas issue. Additional recognition was given in Austin Thompson's 1876 work "The House of Santa Claus, a Christmas Fairy Show for Sunday Schools".

The elves are generally said to live for hundreds, or even thousands, of years, despite the fact that in some cases they appear eternally youthful as children.

Carbonatite (pron) is a type of igneous rock. It has greater than 50% carbonate minerals.  Carbonatites may be confused with marble, so may need geochemical analysis to make sure.

Carbonatites usually occur as small plugs, or as dikes, sills, breccias, and veins. They are almost all near or in continental rift-related tectonic settings. 

It seems that there has been a steady increase in the carbonatitic igneous activity through the Earth's history, from the Archean eon to the present. Carbonates in general are typical products of life-forms.

[[Cryogenics]]

CATEGORIES: Physics, Temperature, Machines

In physics, cryogenics is the production and behaviour of materials at very low temperatures.

It is not well defined at what point on the temperature scale refrigeration ends and cryogenics begins. A gas may be cryogenic if it can be liquefied at or below -150. 

The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology considers cryogenics as involving temperatures below -180. The normal boiling points of helium, hydrogen, neon, nitrogen, oxygen, and normal air are below −180 °C. 

The Freon refrigerants, hydrocarbons, and other common refrigerants have boiling points above −180 °C.

Discovery of superconducting materials has raised interest in reliable, low cost methods of producing high temperature cryogenic refrigeration. The term "high temperature cryogenic" means temperatures from above the boiling point of liquid nitrogen, -195.79, up to -50.

Cryogenicists use the Kelvin or Rankine temperature scale, both of which measure from absolute zero, rather than more usual scales such as Celsius which measures from the freezing point of water at sea level or Fahrenheit with its zero at an arbitrary temperature.

[[Body cavity]]

CATEGORIES: Anatomy

Many animals have spaces or compartments in their body. These spaces or compartments are called body cavity. They  are there for organs, or other structures. Sometimes, there is a space between two organs. This space is known as potential body cavity. Potential body cavities usually contain fluid. In the human body, there is a large body cavity on the side of the belly, and another on the side of the back. The one on the side of the belly is called ventral body cavity, the one on the back dorsal body cavity.

The membranes that surround the central nervous system organs (the brain and the spinal cord, in the cranial and spinal cavities are the three meninges. The differently lined spaces contain different types of fluid. In the meninges for example the fluid is cerebrospinal fluid; in the abdominal cavity the fluid contained in the peritoneum is a serous fluid.

In amniotes and some invertebrates the peritoneum lines their largest body cavity called  the coelom.

[[Mountain mist frog]]

CATEGORIES: Animals of Australia, Frogs

The mountain mist frog, Henrietta Creek tree frog or Nyakala frog (Ranoidea nyakalensis) is a frog from Australia.  It lives in Queensland between 380 and 1020 metres above sea level.

This frog lives in and near streams where the water flowed so fast that it turned white.  Scientists saw the adult frogs sitting on rocks or leaves near the streams.

The tadpoles live in the fast water.  Scientists wrote that they had strong tails for swimming and bodies meant for the water to flow over them. Sometimes they would dig into the sand to hold on during floods.  The tadpoles would spend the winter in mountain streams and grow into frogs in the spring.

This frog is in danger of dying out. Scientists last saw the adult frog and tadpoles in 1990.  They saw them in the Carbine Tableland.

Scientists think pigs that escaped from humans might be one reason why the frog is endangered.  The pigs rip up the streams where the frog would live.  They also think the fungal disease chytridiomycosis might be killing these frogs.  Scientists also thought habitat loss, human beings building roads and farms where the frog would live, was killing the frogs, but the Australian government protected the frogs' home in 1988.

[[Vapor pressure]]

CATEGORIES: Thermodynamics

Vapor pressure is the pressure applied by a vapor in thermodynamic equilibrium with its condensed phases at a given temperature in a closed system. The vapor pressure shows how fast a liquid evaporates. A substance with a high vapor pressure at normal temperatures is often called a volatile.  As the temperature of a liquid increases, the kinetic energy of its molecules also increases. As the kinetic energy of the molecules increases, the number of molecules changing into a vapor also increases, so it increases the vapor pressure.

The peppered tree frog or Black Creek tree frog, speckled leaf tree frog or speckled tree frog (Ranoidea piperata) is a frog from Australia.  Scientists saw it on the New England Tableland in New South Wales.  Scientists have seen it between 800 and 1120 metres above sea level.

This frog is in danger of dying out.  It might already be extinct.  Scientists have not seen this frog for sure since 1973.  Some scientists saw and heard a frog that looked like the peppered tree frog in the 1990s, but their voices sounded different.  In the 1990s, scientists decided that they needed to study the genes and DNA of this frog and its relatives before they could truly say which were separate species and which were not.  Its relatives are Ranoidea barringtonensis, Ranoidea pearsoniana, and Ranoidea phyllochroa.

Scientists are not sure why this frog is dying out.  Many of the streams where it used to live have been changed by human beings who wanted to graze animals there.  These streams also have invasive species, for example the mosquitofish, which eats tadpoles.

[[Sunbird]]

CATEGORIES: Passeriformes

Sunbirds and spiderhunters make up the family Nectariniidae. They are small, slender passerines from the Old World, usually with downward-curved bills. Many are brightly coloured, with iridescent feathers, especially the males. Many species have long tail feathers. They live mainly in equatorial regions. There are 145 species in 16 genera.  

Most sunbirds feed largely on nectar, but will also eat insects and spiders, especially when feeding their young. Long narrow flowers are punctured at the base near the nectaries, where the birds get the nectar. Fruit is also often part of their diet. 

The sunbirds have similarities with two distantly related groups: the hummingbirds of the Americas and the honeyeaters of Australia. The resemblances are due to convergent evolution. They all have a similar nectar-feeding lifestyle. Some sunbird species can take nectar by hovering like a hummingbird, but they usually perch to feed.

[[Red Lady of Paviland]]

CATEGORIES: Archaeology

Red Lady of Paviland is the name of an almost complete  skeleton, which was found in a cave about 20 from Swansea, in 1823. It was the first time, there was a scientific publication on the find of an anatomically modern man. The skeleton turned out to be 33.000 years old, and was probably among the first people on the British Isles.

The skeleton was painted with red ochre.  As pearls and ivory was found nearby, the skeleton was first thought to be that of a woman. William Buckland who found it, thought that it must have been that of a witch or a prosititute during the Roman Era Britain. In 1968, radiocarbo dating was done, and the skeleton was found to be about 22.000 years old. The man had been bout 21, at the time of his death. The age of 22.000 years was problematic though: it meant that the British Isles would have been settled during a time when it was very cold. Another dating was done in 1989; it found an age of 33.000 years. Another dating, done in 2008, gave an age of 33.000 years. 33.000 years ago, there was one of the warmer periods of the ice age. 

Today , the skeleton is kept at the Oxford Museum of Natural History.

Rhabdomyolysis is where damaged skeletal muscles quickly break down. The symptoms can be muscle pains, weakness, vomiting, and confusion. There can also be confusion and tea-colored urine. Rhabdomyolysis can also injure the kidneys with myoglobin.

The most common causes of Rhabdomyolysis are crush injury, strenuous exercise, medications, or drug abuse. 

During rhabdomyolysis, a protein that stores oxygen in the muscles called myoglobin is released into the blood. The kidneys filter the blood and remove the myoglobin. However, the myoglobin breaks down into other chemicals which damages the kidneys which can cause severe injury or even death.

[[Growling grass frog]]

CATEGORIES: Animals of Australia, Frogs

The growling grass frog, green and gold frog, blue-thighed tree frog, southern bell frog, warty bell frog or green and golden frog (Ranoidea raniformis) is a tree frog from Australia.  It lives in South Australia, New South Wales and Victoria.  It also lives in Tasmania.  It lives in New Zealand as an invasive specie.

When people see this frog, it is usually sitting on plants near ponds, dams or other bodies of water that do not dry up.  It sometimes hides under logs.  Sometimes the tadpoles become frogs in the fall and sometimes they stay tadpoles through the winter and become frogs in the spring.

Scientists are not sure why this frog is endangered.  It could be because there is more ultraviolet radiation than there used to be.  It could be because invasive species, for example the eastern mosquitofish, eat its eggs and tadpoles.  This frog can also catch the fungal disease chytridiomycosis.

[[Common mist frog]]

CATEGORIES: Animals of Australia, Frogs

The common mist frog, Atherton Tableland tree frog, creek frog (Ranoidea rhecola) is a tree frog from Australia.  Scientists saw it in northern Queensland.  It lives as low as sea level and as high as 1120 metres up in the hills.

This frog is in danger of dying out.  It lives in rainforests and sclerophyll forests, in streams where the water flows quickly.  The adult male frog spends time in rocky streams and the female frog and young frog sit on plants near streams.  The tadpole lives where the water flows fast.  They hold onto rocks with their mouths, which are on the undersides of their bodies.

The female frog lays 46-63 eggs at a time.  They are 2.4-2.6 mm in diameter. She lays them in groups under rocks in the water.

Scientists are not sure why this frog is endangered, but they do not think it is droughts or that humans have changed too much of the wild places where they live.  This is because Australia made laws protecting the frogs' home in 1988, but there are still fewer and fewer of them.  Scientists say one reason this frog is endangered is because pigs that have run away from people run through their streams and kill adult frogs.  This frog can catch the fungal disease chytridiomycosis.

Scientists say this frog is related to Ranoidea nannotis.

Experts disagree and say they are racist, are alt-right and do support white supremacy and violence.

According to the Anti-Defamation League, the Proud Boys hate women, Muslims, transmen and transwomen, and immigrants.  The United States FBI says they are an extremist group.  The Southern Poverty Law Center says they are a hate group.

As of 2020, Twitter, Facebook and other social media sites do not allow Proud Boys to post. Square, J.P. Morgan Chase and Paypal all stopped processing payments from the Proud Boys' online store.

[[Environmental racism]]

CATEGORIES: Environment, Racism

Many countries make rules to protect the environment. These rules can be laws, guidelines, or regulations. Ideally, these rules affect all groups in society in the same way. When this is not the case, and one group or community is affected more than the others, this is known as environmental racism.  As is common with racism, the groups are defined based on race, or skin color; sometimes on income.  Very often, all the people decide on these rules. When some groups are excluded from the decision-making process, this is also known as environmental racism.  

Benjamin Chavis first used the term, in the 1980s. At the time, he was a leading member of the Civil rights movement in the United States. The movement found that  when a new landfill was constructed, minorities such as hispanics and black people were affected more often than the white people. The explanation given was the difference in income - hispanics and black people often earn less than white people. A study of 2007 showed that this explanation is too simple and that there are more complex patterns at play. The study also showed that environmental racism occurs in almost all bigger cities in the United States. 

The term was later used to describe the situation in the Niger delta, and in Western New Guinea. 

Environmental justice is a term that started about the same time; it focuses more on distruibuting the benefits and burdens of environmental policies equally in society.

One way to learn new skills is by observing the behavior of other people or animals. This is called  Observational learning. It is a form of social learning which can take different forms.  In humans, this form of learning seems to not need reinforcement;  instead a social model such as a parent, sibling, friend, or teacher with surroundings is needed. For a child,  a model is someone of authority or higher status in an environment. In animals, observational learning is often based on classical conditioning. In classical conditioning instinctive behavior is provoked by observing the behavior of another (e.g. mobbing in birds), but other processes may be involved as well.

[[White Fawn's Devotion]]

CATEGORIES: 1910s movies, American drama movies, American silent movies

White Fawn's Devotion: A Play Acted by a Tribe of Red Indians in America is a  silent film. It was filmed in 1910, in the USA.  James Young Deer wrote and directed the film, but is not credited for this. His wife,  Lillian St. Cyr is credited for playing Princess Red Wing as "White Fawn". The lead woman does not fit St. Cyr's description, so few people believe she played in the film.  The movie was shot in New Jersey at 24fps.

White Fawn's Devotion is the earliest surviving film directed by a Native American.  It was one of the earlier films  French company Pathé shot in America. A reviewer in the New York Dramatic Mirror wrote that the film "proves to be interesting if we can forget the New Jersey scenery" and noted that "it is not quite clear where the devotion comes in, nor of what it consists.".

In 2008, the movie was added to the United States National Film Registry as being deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".

[[Sunda Island tiger]]

CATEGORIES: IUCN Red List critically endangered species, Tigers

The Sunda Island tiger is a tiger that lives on Sunda Islands.  It used to live in Indonesia, Java, Bali and Sumatra. Now the only living Sunda Island tigers are in Sumatra.  The ones in Java and Bali all died.

The Sunda Island tiger is a subspecies of Panthera tigris, not a whole species by itself.  This means their genes are a little different from those of tigers from other places.  They are smaller than other tigers and more likely to have beards or manes of fur around their faces.  They have thick black stripes over their orange fur.  Scientists believe the Sunda island tigers became different from other tigers many years ago when the sea level rose and surrounded what is now the islands they live on.

They live in forests and swamps.  There are fewer than 400 left alive in the wild.  They weigh 165 to 308 pounds. 

They are endangered because of illegal hunting by humans and deforestation.

[[Spencer's river tree frog]]

CATEGORIES: Animals of Australia, Frogs

Spencer's tree frog, Spencer's river tree frog or the spotted tree frog (Ranoidea spenceri) is a tree frog from Australia.  It lives near the Great Dividing Range in Victoria and New South Wales.  It lives between 200 and 1100 metres above sea level.

The adult frog is 4.2 to 7.0 cm in length.  It is green or brown and can have spots. This frog lives in forests on mountains, both dense forests and open forests, both dry forests high in the mountains and wet forests lower down.  It always lives in rocky places near streams.

The female frog lays 200-1000 eggs at a time in between rocks or underneath rocks in the water.  The tadpoles eat algae off rocks and dead things from the bottoms of the water.  Male frogs that live near the bottoms of mountains become adults 18 months after transforming from tadpoles to frogs.  Female frogs that live near the bottoms of mountains become adults 3.5 years after transforming into frogs.  Male frogs that live high in the mountains become adults 3.5 years after transforming into frogs.  Female frogs that live high in the mountains become adults 4.5 years after transforming into frogs.  Adult frogs eat insects.

This frog is in danger of dying out.  Scientists only ever saw this frog in 19 streams.  The frog has disappeared from 4 of them.  The other streams make up 12 groups of frogs who only mate within their group.  Adult frogs do not move much.  Scientists think a single frog does not move more than 80 metres in its whole life.

Scientists are not sure why this frog is endangered, but they think many of them died during the 20th century.  They think two types of invasive species, the rainbow trout and brown trout are eating the tadpoles.  This frog can catch the fungal disease chytridiomycosis.

Laudanum is the name of a tincture containing opium. Paracelsus thought that it was good for treating almost anything. According to Paracelus, laudanum consists of about 9 parts wine, and one part opium. Other ingredients, such as henbane, mandrake and deadly nightshade were commonly added. Since its discovery in the 16th century, laudanum was often used to treat different diseases. Its popularity and use is comparable to the modern drug aspirin. Its main effect was that of the opium: it was a painkiller, and a sedative. 

The main problem is that opium causes addiction. This was only seen starting with the 19th century. Towards the end of the 19th century, there were good alternative drugs. England banished opiates in the 1920s, Germany regulated their use in 1929. 

Laudanum, like other opiates was used as a painkiller, and a sedative. Until the 1970s it was used to treat clinical depression. Laudanum is dangerous to children, it is easy to get an overdose. Today, laudanum is still used to treat severe cases of diarrhea which sometimes occur with chemotherapy.

[[New England tree frog]]

CATEGORIES: Animals of Australia, Frogs

The New England tree frog, gold-striped tree frog, sublime tree frog or glandular tree frog (Ranoidea subglandulosa) is a tree frog from Australia.  Even though it is called the New England tree frog, it does not live in New England.  It lives on Australia's New England Tablelands.  It lives near the Great Dividing Range in Queensland and New South Wales.  It lives more than 600 metres above sea level.

The adult male frog is 4.0 cm long and the adult female is 5.0 cm long.  It can be green or brown on the back and green on the sides.  It has a white stripe on each side of its body.  Parts of its sides and legs are bright orange.

The tadpoles are about 3.5 cm long.  Unlike tadpoles of other tree frogs, they do not have teeth or beaks.  Instead, they have things similar to tentacles near their mouths.  Scientists do not know what the tadpoles eat.

This frog is in some danger of dying out.  Scientists say this is because human beings take animals to eat grass where the frog lives and collect trees from its forests for lumber.  Invasive species such as trout also eat the eggs and tadpoles.

Scientists say this frog is related to Ranoidea citropa.

[[Hyla]]

CATEGORIES: Hyla, Frogs, Animals of Asia

Hyla is a genus of tree frogs in the family Hylidae. Over the years, scientists have changed their minds about which frog species should be in Hyla and which should be in Litoria, Ranoidea or other genera.  At one time, Hyla had more than 300 species from Europe, Asia, Africa, and across the Americas. Now, Hyla has only 17 extant (living) species. They are from Europe, northern Africa and Asia. The earliest known fossil from a Hyla frog is †Hyla swanstoni from the Eocene.  The fossil was found in Saskatchewan, Canada, but it is not clear whether we would consider swanstoni a Hyla frog today.

Josephus Nicolaus Laurenti made the genus in 1768. He named it after Hylas from Greek mythology.  Hylas was a friend of Hercules. Even though the mythological person Hylas was male, the name Hyla is given the feminine grammatical gender.

Some people say this word comes from the Greek word ὕλη (grc, "forest" or "wood"), but it does not.

Game Over is a 2004 American adult computer-animated sitcom created by David Sacks (who would later become president of Nickelodeon Animation Studio), produced by Carsey-Werner Productions and broadcast on UPN in 2004. It was cancelled after five episodes.

Game Over (the title was inspired by the phrase "game over" that commonly concludes video games) focused on what happens to video game characters after the game ends. The show recounted the lives of the Smashenburns, a far-from-ordinary suburban family that lives in an alternate video game universe.

The show made numerous references to video games and even featured certain game characters as cameos. For example, Crash Bandicoot appears on a Got Milk? billboard whilst creatures from Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee appear in one of the episodes.

Marisa Tomei voiced Raquel Smashenburn in the series' unaired pilot episode, but scheduling problems made Lucy Liu take over the role for the actual series.

Game Over was heavily hyped by UPN before its debut. The series generally received positive press upon its airing. Despite this, only six episodes were made, which aired on a variety of different days – the fourth and fifth episodes were broadcast on April 2, 2004 and the sixth episode ("Monkey Dearest") was not aired.

[[DiGeorge syndrome]]

CATEGORIES: genetic disorders, Syndromes

DiGeorge syndrome, or 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, is a syndrome caused by the deletion of a small segment of chromosome 22. The symptoms are caused by the lack of those genes.  

The symptoms often include congenital heart problems, facial features,  infections, developmental delay, learning problems and cleft palate. Other conditions include kidney problems, hearing loss and autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis or Graves disease.

DiGeorge syndrome is due to the deletion of 30 to 40 genes in the middle of chromosome 22 at a location known as 22q11.2. About 90% of cases occur due to a new mutation during early development, while 10% are inherited from a person's parents. 

The condition is autosomal dominant: only one affected chromosome is needed for the condition to occur. Diagnosis is suspected based on the symptoms and confirmed by genetic testing.

Although there is no cure, treatment can improve symptoms. This often includes efforts to improve the function of the many organ systems involved. Long-term outcomes depend on the symptoms present and the severity of the heart and immune system problems. With treatment, life expectancy may be normal.

DiGeorge syndrome occurs in about 1 in 4,000 people. The syndrome was first described in 1968 by American physician Angelo DiGeorge. In late 1981, the underlying genetics were determined.

Notes on Nationalism is a well-known essay written by George Orwell. Orwell wrote the essay in May 1945, in a journal called Polemic, after the Second World War had ended. In the essay, Orwell describes his idea of nationalism as:

Here, he links nationalism to political power, influence and factionalism. He says nationalism is not the same as patriotism, as patriotism "is of its nature defensive.... Nationalism, on the other hand, is inseparable (hard to separate) from the desire for power."

He says that it can be positive, i.e. for something, such as one's country. Orwell says Celtic nationalism and Zionism are examples of this sort of nationalism. On the other hand, it can be negative, i.e. against something, such as another group. Orwell says Anti-Soviet Trotskyism ans Antisemitism are examples of this sort.

Transferred nationalism is a third kind. This is identification and promotion of a different race, social class, or country to your own.
