In December 1859, a shepherd called Robert Blinman, from the nearby Angorichina station (farm) found copper. He was nickmaned "Peg Leg" because he had a wooden leg. With a group of friends he started the Wheal Blinman, a copper mine in 1861. The town grew quickly and by 1869 there were about 1,500 people living there. Many miners were Cornish men, who had been mining for copper at Burra, South Australia. The mine, later called the Blinman Consolidated Copper Mining Company of South Australia, soon became the biggest and most productive mine in the Flinders Ranges. About 10,000 tonnes of copper were taken from the mine which finally closed in 1918.

William Kekwick (died 1872), who explored South Australia and the Northern Territory with John McDouall Stuart, is buried in the Blinman cemetery.

The Blinman Copper Mine is now a tourist attraction, and visitors can explore the underground mine.

[[Derby Industrial Museum]]

CATEGORIES: Grade II listed buildings, Museums in Derby, 1974 establishments in England

Derby Silk Mill, is a museum of industry in Derby, England. The museum is housed in  a historic former silk mill which is part of Derwent Valley Mills.  Between 1717 and 1721 George Sorocold built Britain’s first mill beside the River Derwent. This mill was built to produce silk threads using machines powered by a water wheel.

John Lombe copied the design for the machines used for spinning large quantities of silk, when he was working within the Italian Silk Industry. This may be the first example of industrial espionage.

Traditionally the spinning wheel had been used for producing small quantities of silk thread at the homes of local spinsters. But these new, large machines were able to produce far greater quantities of silk and came to compete with the Italians. However, these machines required large buildings and a huge power source. An undershot water wheel turned by the mill fleam on the west side of the new Silk Mill drove these large spinning machines.

John Lombe unnaturally died in 1722. It was believed that he was killed with poison by an Italian as the revenge for stealing trade secrets. His half brother, Sir Thomas Lombe Knt., died on 2 June 1739 leaving his estate to his widow and their two daughters. 

Dame Elizabeth advertised the lease of the building and machinery in 1739, and the remaining 64 years of the lease were assigned to Richard Wilson junior of Leeds for £2,800.

Richard Wilson stayed in Leeds and took a proportion of the profits. The mill was conducted by William and Samuel Lloyd (both London merchants) and Thomas Bennet as salaried manager.

A description of the mill by William Wilson dating from sometime between 1739 and 1753 is left as follows:

These circular spinning machines (also known as 'throwing machines'), were the most progressive feature of the factory. Also, they used the single source of power (water), and employed many organized workers (200-400, according to recent sources). Due to these total process of production from raw silk to fine quality thread, the Lombes' silk mill is regarded as the first successful use of the factory system in Britain.

The Silk Mill was visited by many tourists. For example, Boswell visited there in September 1777. Not all visitors thought that the mill was in good condition. Torrington commented on the "heat, stinks and noise". In 1835, Fairholt was shocked at unhealthy poor children. Foreign visitors also visited the mill during their trips.

William Hutton was once the employees and he later recalled the long hours, low wages and beatings. Work only stopped in time of extreme dryness or frost, or lack of silk supply. But in August 1748, unofficial holidays were taken during elections and Derby races.

The partnership of Wilson and Lloyd ended in 1753 due to quarrel and legal suits. Lloyd remained in possession of the building and machinery. 

In 1765 Thomas Bennet bought the mill from Lloyd subject to a mortgage to the Wilson family but the mill was neglected for years, because other mills in Derby and Cheshire had grown to become competitor, and silk trade itself had declined.

Lamech Swift became the sub-tenant in 1780. He paid £7 to the Corporation and £170 to Thomas Wilson (brother of Richard and William) per year respectively. He conflicted with the Corporation on repairs to dams in 1781, he remained in occupation until the lease expired in 1803.

The Corporation advertised the lease in 1803 to run for 60 years. The advertisement said that the "Italian works" was still used for throwing silk.

In November 1833, labor movements began in Derby which led to the formation of the Grand National Trades Union in February 1834. Several months later, Tolpuddle Martyrs occurred. The Silk Mill was not at the centre of the movements, Taylor (the mill's lessee at this time) was one of the employers who agreed not to employ any worker who was a union member. By the middle of April 1834 Taylor reported that two-thirds of his machinery was working and many of his former workers were applying for reinstatement. According to "The Derby Mercury" some of the former unionists were never able to find next employment in Derby. This event is commemorated by a march organized by the Derby Trades Union Council every year on the weekend before MayDay.

The Taylor family remained in occupation of the mill but in 1865 they ruined and were forced to sell their machinery and lease.  "The Derby Mercury" advertised many silk mills for sale that year, and it were obvious that a general depression was hitting the industry. This took place four years before the Cobden Treaty with France which is said to have effectively destroyed the British silk industry.

The long connection with silk production ended in about 1908 when F.W. Hampshire and Company, the Chemists, moved into the buildings to make fly papers and cough medicines. On 5 December 1910 at 5.00 am, fire broke out in the near flour mill of Sowter Bothers and soon the flame spread to the Silk Mill. The mill's east wall fell into the river and the whole building was burnt up. Great efforts were made by the Borough Fire Brigade and the Midland Railway Company who saved the shell of the tower and the outline of the doorways leading into the original five floors. These can still be seen today on the tower staircase. The building was rebuilt at the same height but with three stories instead of five and remains that way today.

During the 1920s the building passed ownership to the Electricity Authority. They used it partly as stores, workshops and a canteen. Hidden from the road by the power station, the mill's existence was largely forgotten by the general public until the power station was removed in 1970. It was then converted into Industrial Museum which Derby had proposed for a long time. The museum opened on 29 November 1974.

[[Thylacosmilus]]

CATEGORIES: Mammals of South America, Fossils, Metatheria, Sabretooth cats

Thylacosmilus is a extinct genus of carnivorous sparassodont. found as fossils in deposits dated from about 10 million to 3 million years ago (late Miocene to late Pliocene epoch) in Argentina, South America. 

Thylacosmilus was sabre-toothed and was about as large as a modern jaguar. To a remarkable degree, Thylacosmilus paralleled the evolution of felid sabre-toothed cats like Smilodon. Its canine teeth were long and powerfully developed; they were used for stabbing prey. Its killing method was to hold its prey, and make deep bites into the soft tissue driven by powerful neck muscles. The canine teeth were protected by a well-developed flange, or projecting edge, in the chin region of the lower jaw. The canines continued to grow during adult life, which they do not in marsupials or placental mammals.

Thylacosmilus died out during the late Pliocene, whereas saber-toothed cats did not get to South America until the middle Pleistocene epoch. As a result, the last appearance of Thylacosmilus is separated from the first appearance of Smilodon by over one and a half million years.

James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde PC (19 October 1610 – 21 July 1688) was an Anglo-Irish (from English and Irish family) politician and soldier. From 1641 to 1647, he was the leader in the fight against the Irish Catholic Confederation. From 1649 to 1650 he was top commander of the Royalist forces fighting against Oliver Cromwell who wanted to invade Ireland. In the 1650s he lived in exile in Europe with Charles II of England. When Charles II was put back on the British throne during the restoration in 1660, Ormonde became very important in English and Irish politics.

[[Macbeth (opera)]]

CATEGORIES: Compositions by Giuseppe Verdi, Operas

Macbeth is an opera by Giuseppe Verdi.  It is based on Shakespeare’s play with the same name.  The opera is normally in Italian, though there is also a French version that's almost never used anymore.  The  libretto (the words) was written by Francesco Maria Piave with some extra additions by Andrea Maffei.

Verdi wrote several works based on Shakespeare plays.  Macbeth was the first of these.  It was composed in 1847, at a time when he was composing a lot of operas.  In those days Italian operas were always about a love story, but Macbeth was unusual because there was no love story.  Instead, it is a story about wanting power, even if means murder.  The opera helped to make him very famous, and it has remained one of his most popular operas.

[[Royal Hospital Kilmainham]]

CATEGORIES: Buildings and structures in Dublin, 1684

The Royal Hospital Kilmainham is a 17th-century building in Kilmainham, Dublin, Ireland. It was built to be a home for retired soldiers. It was used as a home for over 250 years. 

The hospital was built between 1680 and 1684 by architect Sir William Robinson. He was the official State Surveyor General for James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland to King Charles II. 

The style is based on Les Invalides in Paris. The Royal Hospital Chelsea in Chelsea, London was completed two years later and looks alike in style. 

The Tudor Gothic gateway at the end of the road leading to the Royal Hospital was designed by Francis Johnston. He was one of the leading architects of the day. This gateway originally stood beside the River Liffey at Bloody Bridge (now Rory O'More Bridge). It was moved after the arrival of the railway in 1844. 

When the Irish Free State was formed, they thought about using the building for the Oireachtas Éireann, the new Irish national parliament. This did not happen. After the soldiers were all gone, the buildings were used for different things like offices for the Garda Síochána (the Irish police force) and as storage for the National Museum of Ireland. 

The Government of Ireland restored the buildings in different stages from 1957, and opened in 1985 as the National Centre for Culture and the Arts. In 1991 the Irish Museum of Modern Art was opened here.

Every year on the National Day of Commemoration the President of Ireland lays a wreath in the courtyard in memory of all Irishmen and Irishwomen who have died in past wars and on service with the United Nations.

[[Balancing selection]]

CATEGORIES: Classical genetics

Balancing selection refers to selective processes by which different alleles (different versions of a gene) are kept in the gene pool of a population at frequencies above that of gene mutation.

This usually happens when the heterozygote for a gene has a higher relative fitness than the homozygote. In this way genetic polymorphism is conserved.

Evidence for balancing selection can be found in the number of alleles in a population which are maintained above mutation rate frequencies. All modern research has shown that this significant genetic variation is common in panmictic populations. It is the field experience of Darwin, Wallace and others, that natural populations in the wild are extraordinarily varied. Museum collections of single species tell the same story.

There are several ways balancing selection works to maintain polymorphism. The two major and most studied are heterozygote advantage and frequency-dependent selection.

[[Grand Tour]]

CATEGORIES: Tourism, Travel

The Grand Tour was the name of travel through Europe by rich European (mostly British) young men between 1660 until about 1840. It was done to learn about European society and art. The idea was that what they learned on their travels could be used to help those that stayed at home. Italy was often the final country to visit.

[[Alnico]]

CATEGORIES: Alloys

Alnico is a type of alloy made up of iron with aluminium (Al), nickel (Ni) and cobalt (Co). The name is an acronym from Al-Ni-Co. Alnico may also contain copper and sometimes titanium.

Alnico alloys are ferromagnetic (a mechanism by which some materials form permanent magnets). Alnico alloys also have a high coercivity (they do not easily lose their magnetism) and are used to make permanent magnets. Before rare-earth magnets were developed in the 1970s, alnico magnets were the strongest type of magnet. The development of Alnico began in 1931 when T. Mishima in Japan found that an alloy of iron, nickel, and  aluminium had double the coercivity of the best magnets of that time. (the coercivity of Alnico is 400 oersted).

[[Random mating]]

CATEGORIES: Classical genetics

Random mating is a term in population genetics. It describes an ideal situation in which  all individuals on one sex are equally potential partners of all members of the opposite sex. The technical term for it is panmixia. 

Random mating is one of the requirements for the Hardy–Weinberg law to hold. This is the foundation equation of population genetics.

There are a number of types of non-random mating, such as mate choice (selection by females from a small group of males), mating type (in microorganisms like Paramecium), selfing in some flowering plants, and in general, inbreeding. Mechanical or geographical differences within a species will often prevent a whole species being panmictic.

The opposite of random mating is assortative mating.

[[Hollow-cathode lamp]]

CATEGORIES: Lamps

A hollow-cathode lamp (HCL) is type of cold cathode lamp used in physics and chemistry as a spectral line source (for example, in atomic absorption spectrometers) and as a frequency tuner for light sources such as lasers. An HCL takes advantage of the hollow cathode effect, which causes conduction at a lower voltage and with more current than a cold cathode lamp that does not have a hollow cathode.

The HCL is a light source or radiation source which is used to excite electrons of a metal of interest to a higher energy level. Excitation is when an electron in its lowest energy state, also known as the ground state, undergoes a transition to a higher energy state known as an excited state. These transitions can occur through heat, electrical energy, light, particles, or a chemical reaction.

[[Photomultiplier tubes]]

CATEGORIES: Light

A photomultiplier tube (PMT) is a transducer which converts photons into electrons, which generate a current and voltage. Photomultiplier tubes are used to detect low levels of incident light, even as low as a single photon.

An incoming photon will strike the photocathode surface of the PMT which will emit electrons. These electrons are then accelerated toward additional electrodes by a potential difference of about 90 volts. Upon striking this electrode, more electrons are emitted. This process repeats nine times, each time generating more and more electrons. This process can generate 106 to 107 electrons for each individual photon. These electrons are then collected at the anode where the current and voltage is then measured. 

Photomultiplier tubes are highly sensitive and have very quick response times. The sensitivity of the PMT can be improved by cooling it, to reduce temperature induced noise. Photomultiplier tubes must not be exposed to intense light, such as the sun or ambient light because the intensity can damage the components. 

Photomultiplier tubes are commonly used for analysis techniques as well as medical and research purposes.

[[Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry]]

CATEGORIES: Mass spectrometry, Laboratory techniques

Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) combines the features of gas-liquid chromatography (GC) and mass spectrometry (MS). This makes it possible to identify different substances within a test sample. GC-MS has many uses include drug detection, fire investigation, environmental analysis and explosives investigation. It can also be used to identify unknown samples. GC-MS can also be used in airport security to detect substances in luggage or on human beings. Additionally, GC-MS can identify trace elements in deteriorated materials, even after the sample fell apart so much that other tests cannot work.

GC-MS is the best way for forensic experts to identify substances because it is a specific test. A specific test positively identifies the actual presence of a particular substance in a given sample. A non-specific test only says that categories of substances are in the sample. Although a non-specific test could statistically suggest the identity of the substance, this could lead to false positive identification.

[[Andrea Moda Formula]]

CATEGORIES: Formula One constructors

Andrea Moda Formula, commonly referred to as Andrea Moda, was a Formula One team which raced in the 1992 Formula One season. It was founded by Andrea Sassetti, who owned a shoe maker in Italy. In 1991 Sassetti bought the old Coloni F1 team which had failed to get through pre-qualifying.

The team was excluded from the opening race in South Africa after not paying the required $100,000 entry fee for new teams. Sassetti argued that the team was a continuation of the Coloni team. Even still, the car was not ready, as the team did not participate in the next race in Mexico. Even though the team was entered in the next race, in Brazil, with drivers Roberto Moreno and Perry McCarthy, the cars were still not ready. At the fifth race in San Marino the car was finally ready but McCarthy did not receive his Super License, which is required to race a F1 car. However, Moreno finally qualified his car in Monaco, only to retire during the race due to an engine problem.

In Canada, the team did not have engines because Sassetti did not pay the engine supplier, Judd, the money. The team also missed France due to their car being stuck in a blockade by French truck drivers.

In August of 1992, the FIA warned the team that they might be excluded (disqualified, does not count) from the championship. It was a known fact that McCarthy was barely given a chance, since the team could not afford to properly run two cars, so they mainly worked on Moreno's car while McCarthy was only there to meet the rules of having two cars in the race.

Finally, at the Belgian Grand Prix, Sassetti was arrested for forging invoices  . The team was not allowed in the paddock at the Italian Grand Prix, because the FIA banned the team brought Formula One into disrepute.

[[Size-exclusion chromatography]]

CATEGORIES: Laboratory techniques

Size-Exclusion Chromatography (SEC) separates components of mixture based on the size. Recall a mixture can be composed of many substances each with different physical and chemical properties which can be used to differentiate them. SEC essentially allows components that are larger in size to exit the column (elute) first while components that are smaller in size will exit the column last.  

A typical column used in SEC has two substances called phases that interact with the mixture and these substances help force the separation of the mixture. The mobile phase is a solvent which helps carry the mixture down the column, and the stationary phase which does not move. Unlike other chromatography methods, the stationary phase used in SEC does not exploit the polarity of each component.  It is worth noting there is no chemical interaction between the stationary phase and a component.  A column could be packed with two types of stationary phase material.  First the stationary phase could be a porous solid. A common porous solid is silica which has a diameter of 5-10µm and a pore sizes ranging from 100-1000Å. Silica provides excellent rigidity and will not move throughout the column. Porous solids are also stable at high pressures and temperatures which allows for the use of a vast variety of solvents. Unfortunately silica particles have a tendency to allow absorb soluble components and they have the capacity to break down components into atoms. For these reasons columns could also be packed with porous gels.  The structure of gel is vastly different from a porous solid because gel’s have a polymer-like (a repeating structure of the same substance) structure.  Gels have been shown to be more effective than porous solids at allowing components through its pores. Gels have pore sizes ranging from 100-100000Å. So how is it that larger molecules exit the column before smaller molecules?  

The porous material will not allow larger molecules to pass so these molecules go to the next pore and again they cannot pass. They eventually get to the bottom of the column and exit the column.  Remember there is volume inside the column that is not inhabited by the stationary phase which allows for the flow of both the mobile phase and the sample. These larger molecules then find themselves at the bottom of the column whereas smaller molecules have a longer path to travel.  Smaller molecules can pass through a pore and then pass through another one. The smaller a molecule is, the greater the chance is that it can fit into a pore which means the longer it spends inside the column.

The Commonwealth of the Philippines (Commonwealth de Filipinas, Komonwelt ng Pilipinas) was the name of the Philippines from 1935 to 1946 when it was still controlled by the United States. The Philippine Commonwealth had been created by the Tydings-McDuffie Act, which was approved by the U.S. Congress in 1934. When Manuel L. Quezon became president in 1935, he was the first Filipino to head an elected government in the Philippines.

The President of the Philippine Commonwealth had strong control of the islands and was guided by a Supreme Court. The National Assembly or law-making part of the government, members mostly come from the Nacionalista Party, was at first only one, but later became two, a lower part and a higher part. In 1937, the government chose Tagalog, the language of Manila, as the national language.

Women were allowed to vote, and the economy was strong.

The Philippine Commonwealth government was forced out of the country from 1942–1945, when the Philippines was under Japanese control. In 1946, the Philippine Commonwealth ended when the Third Philippines Republic began.

[[Flame ionization detector]]

CATEGORIES: Laboratory equipment

Flame Ionization Detectors (shortened FID) is a common type detector used in gas chromatography. These detectors are best at detecting organic compounds. The first flame ionization detector was developed in 1957 in Australia.

The purpose of a FID is to detect compounds as they exit out of the gas chromatography column. The compounds that are exiting the column are in the gas phase. Detection is done by first turning the gas compounds into ions and electrons and then collecting the charged molecules. The FID turns compounds into ions and electrons by putting them into a flame. The fuel used to make the flame in FIDs is usually made of a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen.  As these charged materials are collected, they make a current which is measured. The larger the current the more charged compounds are being collected. Currents for FIDs are usually about 10-12 amps and are measured by a high-impedance picoammeter.

Flame ionization detectors are used most often for organic compounds. This is because organic compounds contain lot of carbon atoms which easily turn into ions. Reduced carbons (carbons with no oxygen bonds) make the most ions. Other carbons such as alcohols (C-O-H) and carbonyls (C=O) do not make as many ions.

Many times organic samples being tested are not pure. The samples often contain impurities such as water (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrous oxides (NO), and noble gases. The FID does not detect these impurities because they do not burn. This makes the FID a very useful detector because the samples being tested do not have to be purified before being tested.

FID can be used to detect very small amounts of material, as small as 10-13 g/s. It is also accurate over a large range of molecule amounts (a range of over 107). One problem with FID is that it destroys the sample being tested. Any sample used in gas chromatography with an FID cannot be used for other measurements afterwards. Also, a lot of fuel is required as well as very exact equipment to get exact results.

[[Time-domain spectroscopy]]

CATEGORIES: Spectroscopy

Time-domain spectroscopy is a type of spectroscopy that measures the power of electromagnetic radiation as a function of time.  Normal spectroscopy is frequency-domain spectroscopy.  It measures radiation as a function of frequency or wavelength.  Time-domain spectroscopy usually requires the use of Fourier transforms.

Two monochromatic lights of different frequencies can combine to show interference patterns.  At time t=0, the waves interfere constructively.  This gives a maximum in the added plot.  The waves get more out of phase.  This leads to destructive interference and a minimum in the added plot.  From one peak maximum to the next is a cycle.  So when looking at two monochromatic lights, they can be graphed as two lines in the frequency-domain (this plot shows power, P(ν), as a function of frequency).  The same two lights can be plotted as the sum of their waves in the time-domain (this plot shows power, P(t), as a function of time).

  Absorptions in spectra usually look like broad peaks.  This means that a peak may contain many wavelengths of radiation.  These wavelengths can be plotted in the time domain.  Notice that there are now smaller areas of constructive interference.  This is because the closely spaced wavelengths quickly become more and more out of phase.

[[Gut flora]]

CATEGORIES: Microbiology, Physiology

Gut flora consists of microorganisms that live in the digestive system of animals. It is the largest reservoir of microbes in the human microbiome.

The human body, consisting of about 100 trillion cells, carries about ten times as many microorganisms in the intestines. The metabolic activities performed by these bacteria resemble those of an organ, leading some to call gut flora a 'forgotten organ'. It is estimated that these gut flora have around 100 times as many genes in aggregate as there are in the human genome.

Bacteria make up most of the flora in the colon and up to 60% of the dry mass of faeces. Somewhere between 300 and 1000 different species live in the gut, with most estimates at about 500. However, it is probable that 99% of the bacteria come from about 30 or 40 species.  Fungi and protozoa also make up a part of the gut flora, but little is known about their activities.

Research suggests that the relationship between gut flora and humans is not merely commensal (a non-harmful coexistence), but rather a symbiotic relationship.  Though people can survive without gut flora, the microorganisms perform a host of useful functions, such as fermenting unused energy substrates, training the immune system, preventing growth of harmful, pathogenic bacteria, regulating the development of the gut, producing vitamins for the host (such as biotin and vitamin K), and producing hormones to direct the host to store fats.  However, in some conditions, some species can cause disease by producing an infection or increasing cancer risk for the host.

Such food compounds as polyphenols, oligosaccharides and polysaccharides may be useful for good bacteria and help reduce pathogenic species of human gut flora.

Over 99% of the bacteria in the gut are anaerobic, but in the cecum, aerobic bacteria reach high densities.

The traditional view is that no metazoan phylum can break down cellulose by producing the enzyme cellulase. Instead, herbivores contain, in their gut, microorganisms which produce cellulase. This is important because cellulose is the most common organic compound on Earth. About 33% of all plant matter is cellulose (the cellulose content of cotton is 90% and that of wood is 40–50%). Recently, evidence has emerged that some animals do produce their own cellulase. The question is not yet quite settled.

[[First-past-the-post voting]]

CATEGORIES: Voting systems

First-past-the-post is a voting system used by some countries to elect their governments or the members of their parliaments.  In a first-past-the-post system, a country is divided into constituencies.  In these constituencies people known as candidates, each of whom usually represents a different political party, will stand for election to the country's parliament.  In the individual constituencies, the candidate who gets the most votes from people, wins the race to be elected to a seat in parliament.  Plurality is another name for such an electoral system.  It is in contrast to the majority system, where the winning candidate must have more votes than all other candidates combined.

If a party wins over 50% of the seats, it can form a majority government. If no single party wins over 50% of the seats, then either the party with the most seats can form a minority government, or a coalition government can be formed from two or more of the other political parties who together have over 50% of the seats.

Countries using first-past-the-post include the United Kingdom, Canada, India and partly in the United States.

[[Ultraviolet–visible absorption]]

CATEGORIES: Light, Physics, Spectroscopy

Alexander Tolmer (1815—1890) was the man in charge of the South Australian police force. Born in England to French parents, he studied to be a teacher of languages. He joined the army and saw action in Portugal from 1826—1833 during the civil war. Tolmer moved to South Australia in 1836, where Governor George Gawler thought his background in the cavalry would make him the right person to set up a group of mounted police.

In 1852 Tolmer became the police commissioner. He led a group of police from South Australia to the Victorian gold fields and escorted a load of gold back to Adelaide.

In 1856 after a number of small arguments with his offices, Tolmer was removed as commissioner. He tried farming, but this was unsuccessful. He tried to lead an exploring group to cross Australia from south to north, but this also failed before it left Adelaide. He became a ranger for crown lands in 1862 and retired in 1885. He died at Mitcham, South Australia, on 7 March 1890.

[[Conversion of units]]

CATEGORIES: Measurement

The term conversion of units refers to changing an amount of a measurement unit into another unit. There are many different systems of units, so some conversions can be very complex. Most conversions involve a conversion factor (named "m"), and a shift amount (such as "b"), to change from a unit x into a unit y by the general equation: y = m*x + b. That type of conversion is known as a linear transform or a mathematical translation.

A conversion factor is a ratio that lets one convert a measured quantity to a different unit of measure without changing the amount. When a conversion factor is multiplied by the item one are converting, it cancels out the units they does not want and leaves those that they do. Because the top and bottom of conversion factors are the same, conversion factors always equal 1. For example, a  conversion factor of (1 day)/(24 hours) equals 1, because 1 day = 24 hours.

One of the most common conversions is to change meters (or "metres") into feet, by multiplying the amount in meters by about 3.28 feet per meter (ft/m):

Typically, conversion amounts are rounded to the same precision as the original input amount, such as 10 meters being 33 feet (when 32.8 feet is rounded to 2 digits as "33").

Roy Rogers, (Birth name: Leonard Franklin Slye) (November 5, 1911 – July 6, 1998), was an American singer and cowboy actor. Roy Rogers Restaurants chain was named after him. He and his wife Dale Evans, his golden horse (name:Trigger), and his German Shepherd dog (name:Bullet), came in more than 100 movies and The Roy Rogers Show. The show came on radio and then came on television from 1951 through 1957. His productions usually had a sidekick (a companion), usually either Pat Brady, (who drove a Jeep called "Nellybelle") or Andy Devine, or the crotchety (irritating) George "Gabby" Hayes. Rogers's nickname was "King of the Cowboys".  Evans's nickname was "Queen of the West."

==About Roy Roger's life==	

===Early life===		

Leonard Franklin Slye was born in Cincinnati, Ohio in USA. His parents' name was  Andrew and Mattie Syle. His family lived in a tenement building (apartment on rent) on 2nd Street. (Riverfront Stadium was built at this place in 1970 and Leonard joked that he had been born at second base.) His father, Andrew Syle was not happy with his job and city life. So,Andy Slye and his brother Will built a 12-by-50-foot houseboat from salvage lumber. Then, in July 1912, the Slye family floated on the Ohio River towards Portsmouth, Ohio. The Syles family wanted a more stable life in Portsmouth. So, they bought land on which they could built a home.

But, because of the flood of 1913, they were able to move their houseboat to the land. So, they continued living in the houseboat on dry land.

In 1919, the Slyes bought a farm in Duck Run, located near Lucasville, Ohio which is 12 miles north of Portsmouth. There they built a six-room home. But the farm alone could not give a good income for his family, so Leorand's father, Andrew took a job at a shoe factory in Portsmouth. He lived there during the week and came back home on the weekends. He used to bring gifts for his family after paydays (the day payment is given). One important gift was a horse on which Leonard learned how to ride a horse.

After Leonard comleted his eight grade, he studied at High School in McDermott, Ohio. When he was 17, his family returned to Cincinnati. In Cincinnati, his father started work at another shoe factory. Leonard also wanted to help his family to earn more money. So, he left high school. He started to work with his father at the shoe factory and went to night school. 

Leonard was made laughed at (made fun of) for sleeping in class. So, he left the night school and never joined again.

Leonard and his father did not like their factory jobs. In 1929, his older sister, Mary, went to Lawndale, California with her husband. Leonard and his father left their shoe factory jobs. The family lived with Mary for four months and then cam back to Ohio. Soon, Leonard got to go to California with Mary's husband's father. Rest of the family came to California in the spring of 1930.

The Slyes took a small house on rent near Mary. Leonard and his father very soon found jobs as truck drivers for a highway making project. But, when they came to work they got to know that their employer (person who gives job) had become bankrupt (did not have enough money). Soon, came the years of Great Depression. The Slyes were now moving from job to job collecting fruit and living in worker camps. One day, Andrew Slye got to know about a shoe factory giving jobs in Los Angeles. Andrew asked Leonard to join him. Leonard used to feel happy playing guitar and singing around campfires. So, he told his father that he wanted to earn money through music. His father allowed him to do so. Leonard and his cousin Stanley Slye went to Los Angeles and started to perform as The Slye Brothers.

Leonard now came to be known as Len. In 1932, he met Lucille Ascolese while on tour. The same year, a palomino colt (a breed of horse) was born in Santa Cietro, CA. The young horse was first named "Golden Cloud", and later renamed "Trigger". In May 1933, Len, 21, proposed to Lucille, 19, through radio. Len then went on tour with the "O-Bar-O Cowboys". In June 1933, Len met Grace Arline Wilkins at a radio station in New Mexico. She gave Len a lemon pie in return of his singing "Swiss Yodel" on the radio. By August 1934, Len and Lucille had separated as she was jealous and tired of being a musician's wife. Len and Lucille's divorced on June 8, 1936. Len and Grace Arline Wilkins married in Roswell, New Mexico, on June 11, 1936.

In 1941, Len and his wife, Grace adopted a girl, Cheryl Darlene. In 1942, they legally changed their names to Roy and Grace Arline Rogers. The next year, Arline gave birth to a daughter, Linda Lou.

[[Australian Overland Telegraph Line]]

CATEGORIES: Telecommunications, Australia

The Australian Overland Telegraph Line was a 3200 km telegraph line that joined Darwin with Port Augusta in South Australia. Completed in 1872 the Overland Telegraph Line allowed fast communication between Australia and the rest of the world. It was one of the great engineering feats of 19th century Australia. It followed the route discovered by the explorer John McDouall Stuart in 1862. It was probably the most important milestone in Australia's telegraphic history.

Because of the limits of technology, the telegraph messages could only travel about 300 km along the line. Repeater stations were built at regular intervals so that the messages could be resent. Some of the stations became the start of cities such as Alice Springs or Tennant Creek, while others became forgotten ruins, such as the Peake Repeater Station built near Freeling Springs in South Australia.

[[Warumungu people]]

CATEGORIES: Australian Aboriginal groups

The Warumungu (or Warramunga) are a group of Indigenous Australians, who live in the region of Tennant Creek and Alice Springs in the Northern Territory of Australia as well as small towns in South Australia. Many still speak the traditional language, and others speak Kriol.

In June 1861 explorer John McDouall Stuart who was the first Europen person to visit the area was attacked by a group of about 30 Warumungu warriors. They threw boomerangs at the explorers, and then set fire to grass. Stuart says in his journal that he and his men fired their guns at the Warumungu, but he does not mention if any were wounded or killed. The site of the battle has been called Attack Creek. Stuart was forced to return to Adelaide. The Northern Territory government has built a roadside memorial park near the site on the Stuart Highway.

[[Chambers Pillar]]

CATEGORIES: Geography of the Northern Territory

Chambers Pillar (Aboriginal name 'Idracowra' or 'Etikaura') is a sandstone formation about 160 km south of Alice Springs in the Northern Territory of Australia. Erosion by wind and rain has left an isolated pillar of 350 million year old sandstone. It stands 50 metres above the surrounding plain.

John McDouall Stuart was the first Europen to see Chambers Pillar, reaching the site in April 1860. He named it after James Chambers, who had paid for the exploring trip. Over the years numerous visitors have added graffiti by carving names in the soft sandstone at the base of the pillar. 

Chambers Pillar can only be reached by 4WD track. Day tours from Alice Springs are often combined with a trip to Rainbow Valley.

[[Passion play]]

CATEGORIES: Christian genres, Theatrical forms

A Passion play is a religious drama of medieval origin dealing with the suffering, death, and Resurrection of Christ. Early Passion plays (in Latin) consisted of readings from the Gospel with interpolated poetical sections on the events of Christ’s Passion and related subjects, such as Mary Magdalene’s life and repentance, the raising of Lazarus, the Last Supper, and the lament of the Virgin Mary. Use of the vernacular in these interpolations led to the development of independent vernacular plays, the earliest surviving examples being in German. Such plays were at first only preludes to dramatic presentations of the Resurrection. The introduction of Satan (which became typical of German and Czech plays), and thus of introductory representations of the fall of Lucifer and the Fall of man (as in the early 14th-century Vienna Passion), and of scenes from the Old Testament and of the Last Judgment, led to development of cyclic plays similar to the Corpus Christi cycles. The great Celtic Passion cycles of Cornwall and Brittany, and the St. Gall Passion play (which begins with the entry of St. Augustine, who introduces the Old Testament prophets and patriarchs, and also includes the marriage at Cana), exemplify this type of Passion play.

The Tirol plays early formed a separate group, representing only scenes from the Passion and Resurrection. The Bohemian plays, such as the St. Eger Passion, developed from a simpler version of the Vienna Passion, were also distinct in style and incident.

The earliest Passion plays of France and Flanders are thought to have their source in a nondramatic narrative poem of the 13th century, the Passion des jongleurs. These plays became highly elaborated in the course of their development, culminating in performances (Mons, 1501; Valenciennes, 1547) lasting more than a week. Confraternities were founded for performance of Passion plays, the most famous being the Confrérie de la Passion (1402). Passion plays were also performed in Spain, Italy, and elsewhere, with local variations.

By the 16th century, many of the Passion plays, debased by secular influences, had degenerated into mere popular entertainments, full of crude slapstick and buffoonery. Many were forbidden by ecclesiastical authorities, and many more were suppressed after the Reformation.

The most famous of the Passion plays to survive into the 20th century is that performed at Oberammergau, in the Bavarian Alps. According to tradition, the play has been presented every 10 years since 1634, in fulfillment of a vow made after the village was spared an epidemic of plague (shifting to decennial years in 1700), except in 1870 during the Franco-Prussian War and World War II, when religious plays were banned. It remains an entirely local production, with villagers taking all the parts and singing in the chorus. Since 1930 roofed seats have protected the audience from the weather. The production runs from May through September. Some villagers and some Jewish organizations have protested anti-Semitic overtones in the 1860 text. Traditional Passion plays have also been revived in villages in the Austrian Tirol. In northern Spain, during Lent and Holy Week, a Catalan Passion play is performed by villagers; and in Tegelen, in the Netherlands, a modern play by the Dutch poet Jacques Scheurs is given every five years.

[[Königslutter]]

Königslutter am Elm is a city in the district of Helmstedt, Lower Saxony, Germany, near the Elm hills. In 2003, about 17,000 people lived in Königslutter.  Königslutter is twinned with Taunton in Somerset, in the southwest of England.

Königslutter is on the tourist route called the German Half-Timbered House Road (Deutsche Fachwerkstraße).

In its current form, the city was created in 1974 by joining the following 18 municipalities:

Königslutter proper is on the Lutter stream and developed from the village of Lutter which was first mentioned in 1150. It became a market town around 1300, then a city around 1400. In early modern times, beer brewing and Elm limestone mining and cutting have been its main industries. Tourism is also important, because of the German Half-Timbered House Road and the Dom - the monastery church built by Emperor Lothar II.

In 1924, the village of Oberlutter and the monastery church of Königslutter were incorporated as a city. The Benedictine monastery was founded near the village of Lutter in 1135 by Holy Roman Emperor Lothar II. The monastery church is known for its sculptural art and the tomb of the emperor.

Königslutter is also the site for a large psychiatric hospital.  The hospital, run by AWO can treat over 500 people plus outpatients and day-care therapy in the clinics in Wolfsburg and Peine.

Walter Rudolf Hess (17 March 1881 – 12 August 1973) was a Swiss physiologist. He won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1949 for "locating the areas of the brain involved in the control of internal organs". The prize was shared with Egas Moniz. Hess was born on 17 March 1881 in Frauenfeld, Switzerland and died on 12 August 1973 in Locarno, Switzerland.

By stimulating the hypothalamus of cats with tiny electric currents, Hess induced behaviours. The behaviours ranged from excitement to apathy, depending on the position of the stimulation. He could induce different types of responses in the anterior (lateral) hypothalamus compared to stimulating the posterior ventromedial hypothalamus. When stimulating the anterior part, he could induce fall of blood pressure, slowing of breathing and responses such as wanting food, wanting water, needing to pee and needing to poop. On the other hand, stimulation of the posterior part led to extreme excitement and defensive behaviour.

Hess also found that he could induce sleep in cats – a finding that was highly controversial at the time but later confirmed. His work was important step in scientist's understanding of neurosecretion.

[[Stonefly]]

CATEGORIES: Insects

The Stonefly or Plecoptera are an order of aquatic insects. There are some 3,500 described species worldwide, and new ones are still being discovered. Although stoneflies are found worldwide, they are absent from Antarctica. Stoneflies are believed to be one of the most primitive groups of Neoptera. Their close relatives are identified from the Carboniferous and Lower Permian geological periods. True stoneflies, known from fossils, are only a little younger. The larva have claws on their legs. This allows them to better hang on to things in their environment and withstand stronger current. They need fast moving water in streams and rivers to survive. They cannot tolerate the low oxygen saturation found in warm water. They usually live in cold clean streams with a lot of turbulence (such as rapids). The adult stoneflies are easily identified by their wings that fold over their abdomen. The pteronarcys Stoneflies, found only in North American waters, live for several years.

[[Chimney]]

CATEGORIES: Architectural elements

A chimney is a structure used to ventilate hot flue gases  or  smoke from a boiler, stove, furnace or fireplace to the outside atmosphere. Most chimneys are vertical, or almost vertical, to make sure that the gases flow easily, drawing air into the combustion in what is known as the stack, or chimney, effect. The space inside a chimney is called a flue. Chimneys may be found in buildings, steam locomotives and ships. In the United States, the term smokestack  is also used when talking about locomotive chimneys or ship chimneys, the word funnel can be used too.

Stephen Jay Gould (September 10, 1941 – May 20, 2002) was an American paleontologist, evolutionary biologist, taxonomist, and historian of science. 

He was also one of the most influential and widely read writers of popular science of his generation.

Gould spent most of his career teaching at Harvard University and working at the American Museum of Natural History in New York. In the latter years of his life, Gould also taught biology and evolution at New York University near his home in SoHo.

Gould's greatest contribution to science was the theory of punctuated equilibrium, which he developed with Niles Eldredge in 1972. The theory proposes that most evolution is marked by long periods of evolutionary stability, which is punctuated by rare instances of branching evolution. The theory was contrasted against the idea that evolutionary change is marked by a pattern of smooth and continuous change in the fossil record.

Most of Gould's empirical research was based on the snail genera Poecilozonites and Cerion. He also contributed to evolutionary developmental biology, and has received wide praise for his book Ontogeny and Phylogeny. In evolutionary theory he opposed strict selectionism, sociobiology as applied to humans, and evolutionary psychology. He campaigned against creationism.

Many of Gould's Natural History essays were reprinted in collected volumes.

[[Psocoptera]]

CATEGORIES: Insects

Psocoptera are an order of winged insects that are commonly known as booklice, barklice or barkflies. They first appeared in the Permian period, 295–248 million years ago. They are often regarded as the most primitive of the hemipterans. Their name originates from the Greek word psokos meaning gnawed or rubbed and ptera meaning wings. There are more than 5,500 species in 41 families in three suborders. Many of these species have only been described in recent years.

They range in size from 1–10 millimeters (0.04–0.4 in) in length.

[[Thrips]]

CATEGORIES: Insects

Thrips are an order of insects, the Thysanoptera. They are tiny, slender insects with fringed wings. 

Other common names for them are thunderflies, thunderbugs, storm flies, thunderblights, and corn lice. The scientific name for the order Thysanoptera comes from the Greek thysanos (fringe) and pteron (wing).

Thrips feed on a large variety of plants and animals by puncturing them and sucking up the contents. Thrips species are pests if they feed on plants with commercial value.

Thrips found in the British Isles are tiny insects, just 1-2mm long, but in other parts of the world they can be up to 14 mm. They have two pairs of narrow, fringed wings, although some are wingless. More than 6,000 species of thrips are known around the world, with over 300 of these in Europe and about 150 native to Britain.

[[River Tamar]]

CATEGORIES: Rivers of England, Geography of Cornwall, South West England

The River Tamar is a river in South West England, that forms most of the border between Devon (to the east) and Cornwall (to the west). The Tamar's source is less than 6 km (4 miles) from the north Cornish coast, but it flows southward. At its mouth, the Tamar flows into the Hamoaze (a wide estuary) before entering Plymouth Sound. Tributaries of the river include the rivers Inny, Ottery, Kensey and Lynher (or St Germans River) on the Cornish side, and the Deer and Tavy on the Devon side.

King Athelstan of England made the east bank of the River Tamar the boundary between England and Cornwall in the year 936. There are no road bridges over the lower Tamar apart from the modern Tamar Bridge at Saltash which was built to replace the ferry. In 1859 the Royal Albert Bridge was built across the Tamar at Saltash to carry the main railway line into Cornwall. Both bridges connect Saltash with Plymouth.

The Tamar Valley Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty covers around 195 km² (75 square miles) around the lower Tamar (below Launceston) and its tributaries the Tavy and the Lynher. It was first proposed in 1963, but was not designated until 1995.

[[Topoisomerase]]

CATEGORIES: Molecular biology, Enzymes

A topoisomerase is one of a group of enzymes that unwind and wind DNA in order to help the creation of DNA structures. 

DNA is in a helix/spiral which helps make the structure of DNA strong and stable. However, when undergoing DNA replication, the spiral needs to be untwisted, and when spirals are being untwisted knots, and breaks can happen. When studying the structure of DNA, James D. Watson and Francis Crick knew that there was need for an enzyme to overcome this problem. 

Topoisomerase binds to either side of the DNA strands and allows the DNA to be untangled or unwound.

[[Vestigial organ]]

CATEGORIES: Evolutionary biology

Vestigial organs are organs of the body which are smaller and simpler than those in related species. They have lost, or almost lost, their original feature.

Vestigiality is evidence for evolution, since they only make sense if evolution has occurred. They were one of the puzzles of pre-Darwinian natural history. The puzzle vanished once biologists realised they once were working adaptations, in the ancestors of present-day animals.

They occur in animals (and plants) which have changed their style of life from their ancestors. Thus snakes lost their legs as their system of movement changed. But one type of snake – the boas – have vestigial rear legs and pelvis. The human vermiform appendix is another example. That was much larger, and stored microbes which produced cellulase to break down plant cell walls. Leaves are the main diet of apes, but they are not a main part of man's diet. Cellulose cannot be digested by our species.

An unused organ usually degenerates, and becomes smaller or vanishes altogether. Thus amphibia living in dark caves lose their sight and their body colour. Mutations pile up. All structures need energy for their development, maintenance, and weight. This, and the risk of disease in the part (e.g., infection, cancer), provide some selection for the removal of parts which no longer help an organism's fitness.

The human appendix had selection against it because of deaths from appendicitis. Appendicitis was untreatable until modern times. The selection pressure was probably weak, because most cases occur after the age of peak fertility.

Observations on the cave-dwelling amphipod Gammarus minus showed active selection against their vestigial eyes. When mating, the males remain on their females for a week or so after fertilisation, guarding them against other males. The eye sizes of paired males were compared with those of unpaired males. The eye sizes of paired males were smaller than the unpaired ones. Obviously, on average, the paired males would have higher fertility than the unpaired males. The selection gradient was estimated as –0.30, which means the selection for small eyes was quite strong. The researchers supposed that the loss of sight freed more of the nervous system to process other sensory inputs.p310

Occasionally, selection turns vestigial organs to a new function. Thus the mammalian ear ossicles were once bones in the jaw of early proto-mammals, the Therapsida. The halteres of flies is a perfect example. The word exaptation was coined for this phenomenon.

[[Boscastle]]

CATEGORIES: Villages in Cornwall

Boscastle is a village and fishing port on the north coast of Cornwall, United Kingdom, and 14 miles (23 km) south of Bude and 5 miles (8 km) north-east of Tintagel.

The name of the village derives from Bottreaux Castle, a 12th-century fortress, of which little survives. There is no church in Boscastle but there are churches at Forrabury and Minster. Boscastle harbour is a natural inlet protected by two stone harbour walls built in 1584 by Sir Richard Grenville. The oldest part of Boscastle surrounds the harbour; more modern residential building extends up the valleys of the Rivers Valency and Jordan.

A flash flood on 16 August 2004, caused extensive damage to the village. Residents were trapped in houses and elsewhere as the roads turned into rivers. In the largest peacetime rescue operation ever launched in the UK, 91 people were rescued and there were no deaths.

[[Richard Grenville]]

CATEGORIES: 1542 births, 1591 deaths, English explorers, Sailors

Sir Richard Grenville (1542 – 1591) was an English sailor, sea captain and explorer. He took part in the early English attempts to settle the New World. He was in the fight against the Spanish Armada. He died in 1591 at the Battle of Flores, fighting against overwhelming odds, and refusing to surrender his ship, the Revenge, to the far more numerous Spanish.

Sir Richard Grenville was a British naval commander.

He was born of an old Cornish family in about 1541. 

His grandfather, Sir Richard, was a marshal of Calais during the time of Henry VIII.

Richard Grenville's father commanded and lost his life in the "Mary Rose" in 1545. 

At an early age Richard Grenville served in Hungary under the emperor Maximilian against the Turks.

[[Tintagel]]

CATEGORIES: Villages in Cornwall, National Trust properties, Civil parishes in Cornwall

Tintagel, formerly Trevena, is a civil parish and village on the Atlantic coast of Cornwall, United Kingdom. It is about 5 miles from Boscastle and 6 miles from Camelford. The population of the parish is 1,820 people. The village and nearby Tintagel Castle are associated with the legends surrounding King Arthur and the knights of the Round Table. The village has, in recent times, become attractive to tourists from many parts of the world and is one of the most-visited places in Britain. The modern-day village of Tintagel was known as Trevena until the Post Office decided to call it 'Tintagel' in the mid 19th century (until then Tintagel had always been the name of the headland and of the parish).

In the village is the 'Old Post Office', which dates from the 14th century. It became a post office during the 19th century, and is now owned by the National Trust. There are three churches in Tintagel, the Anglican church of St Materiana on the cliffs, and Methodist and Roman Catholic churches in the village.

Scholars have found it hard to explain the origin of 'Tintagel' as a name: the most likely one to be correct is from Norman French, rather than from Cornish.

[[Master's degree]]

CATEGORIES: Academic degrees

A master's degree is the certificate that students get after they complete their bachelor's degree and continue to study in a university in some specific field. In other words, a person must first get a bachelor's degree before they can get a master's degree. People with this degree are considered to possess more advanced knowledge of the field that they had studied, as compared to those who only get a bachelor's degree. There has recently been an increase in programs leading to these degrees in the United States. More than twice as many such degrees are now awarded, as compared to the 1970s. In Europe, most countries offer master's degrees in all fields.

[[Bachelor's degree]]

CATEGORIES: Academic degrees

A bachelor's degree is the certificate given to a university student after he or she has succeeded in an end of course examination. In England and Wales the degree requires three years of study; in North America and some other countries four years are required. 

In many countries there are other qualifications after school attendance is ended. Most of these are below degree level, and based on practical skills, but details vary according to the country. 

In the British tradition there is a distinction between general degrees, and honour degrees or special degrees. In Scotland, for example, a general degree takes three years, while an honours degree takes four years.

The content of a bachelor's degree varies according to the Faculty, the part of the University which does the teaching. In a Faculty of Arts or Humanities a student studies for the Bachelor of Arts. Other traditional Faculties are those of Science, Mathematics, Engineering, and so on. Honours degrees are always labelled by their content, so BSc is a Bachelor of Science, BA a Bachelor of Arts, and so on. Medical degrees are labelled variously. London University awards MB, ChB (bachelor of medicine and surgery) as the basic degree; Edinburgh University awards the MD as the basic qualification.

Higher degrees than the bachelor are possible. Again, regulations vary, but often the next two steps are usually the Master's degree and the PhD degree.

Of the 7,000 species, 5,500 are classified into one suborder, the Gammaridea. The rest are in two or three other suborders. 

Amphipods range in size from  0.1 to 34 centimetres (0.04 to 13 inches) and are mostly detritivores or scavengers. They live in almost all aquatic environments; 750 species live in caves and the order also includes terrestrial animals and sandhoppers such as Talitrus saltator. The largest amphipods live on the sea floor, seven kilometres down.

[[Converter (metallurgy)]]

CATEGORIES: Industries

A converter is a chemical reactor which turns raw iron into steel. 

Raw iron called pig iron which is the product of blast furnace, contains up to 4% of carbon. It is too hard and brittle for meaningful use. The carbon must first be burned off the iron to produce steel. This process is called conversion and the reactor a converter.

The first converter was invented by Sir Henry Bessemer in 1856. He built a pear-shaped large vessel with nozzles (tuyeres) for air in the bottom. Hot molten pig iron from blast furnace was poured in the converter, and then air was pumped in at the bottom with high pressure. The result was a loud noise and a flame of up to 20 metres off the mouth of the converter. After ten minutes all the pig iron had become steel. The Bessemer converter was the first successful reactor on converting pig iron into steel, and the era of steel began. Steel was now plentiful and cheap.

However, steel becomes better if only oxygen is blown in. Air contains nitrogen, which is harmful for some steel grades. A modern converter called basic oxygen furnace uses pure oxygen instead of air. It was invented 1949 in Austria.

The modern basic oxygen converter is a large pumpkin-shape vessel which is made from steel and lined with refractories such as calcium oxide and magnesium oxide line so the vessel can withstand the high temperature of molten metal. 

Molten pig iron and scrap are loaded in the converter. The scrap usually is rusty and contains oxygen, so some of the rust reacts with the pig iron, burning the carbon away and creating heat which melts the scrap. Once all scrap has melted, a special pipe called "oxygen lance" is lowered in the pig iron, and a very fast and sharp blow of oxygen is blasted in. The oxygen burns all the carbon away and mixes the liquid steel thoroughly. Once all carbon has been burned away, some extra carbon is inserted to raise the contents to desired level. The result is liquid steel, which is then tapped away and taken to rolling mill to produce steel products.

[[Tuning fork]]

CATEGORIES: 1711, Music

A tuning fork is a sound resonator which is a two-pronged fork. The prongs, called tines, are made from a U-shaped bar of metal (usually steel). This bar of metal can move freely. It resonates at a specific constant pitch when set vibrating by striking it against an object. It sounds a pure musical tone after waiting a moment to allow some high overtone sounds to die out. The pitch depends on the length of the two prongs. Its main use is as a standard of pitch to tune other musical instruments, and in some tests of hearing.

[[St Neot (Cornwall)]]

CATEGORIES: Villages in Cornwall

St Neot is a parish and village in Cornwall, United Kingdom. It is between the towns of Bodmin and Liskeard. The parish is named after the Saxon monk, Saint Neot (who also gives his name to St Neots in Cambridgeshire). On the northern side the parish includes part of Bodmin Moor and hamlets in the parish include Draynes, Ley and Pantersbridge.

During the English Civil War St Neot was staunchly Royalist. To commemorate this, each year on Oak Apple Day (29 May), an oak branch is mounted on the top of the church tower.

The early medieval church building must have been smaller than the one in existence today and the church was rebuilt in granite in the 15th century. The fine stained glass windows are from about 1500.

The stained glass is partly original and partly from a restoration done by John Hedgeland, ca. 1830.

The Lizard is a peninsula in south Cornwall, United Kingdom. The most southerly point of the British mainland is near Lizard Point at SW 701 115. Lizard village, the most southerly village on the British mainland, is in Landewednack, the most southerly parish.

The peninsula measures approximately 14 x 14. It is southwest of Falmouth ten miles (16 km) east of Penzance.

The name "Lizard" is most probably a corruption of the Cornish name "Lys Ardh", meaning "high court". The name is not connected to the rock called serpentinite which is found here.

The Lizard's coast is particularly hazardous to shipping and the seaways round the peninsula were historically known as the "Graveyard of Ships". The Lizard Lighthouse was built at Lizard Point in 1752 and the RNLI operates The Lizard lifeboat station.

[[St Blazey]]

CATEGORIES: Towns in Cornwall

St Blazey is a small town in Cornwall, United Kingdom, in the civil parish of St Blaise. The name St Blaise is also used by the town council. The population in the 2001 census was 6632.

Historically copper and tin were mined in and around the parish, whilst more recently china clay has been the principal commodity mined. The port of Par Harbour, which is in the parish, was built to make transporting these minerals easier. The Cornwall Minerals Railway, which had a depot and station in the town, was also used to move them.

The Eden Project is within the civil parish, and about 2 from the centre of the town. The large number of visitors this attracts has led to the development of tourism in the town.

[[The Alchemist Discovering Phosphorus]]

CATEGORIES: 1770s paintings, Collections of Derby Museum and Art Gallery, British paintings, 1771

The Alchemist Discovering Phosphorus is a painting by Joseph Wright of Derby which was finished in 1771, then redone 1795. The full title of the painting is "The Alchymist, in Search of the Philosopher’s Stone, Discovers Phosphorus, and prays for the successful Conclusion of his operation, as was the custom of the Ancient Chymical Astrologers". 

The picture shows an alchemist trying to produce the rare Philosopher's Stone, which could turn metal into gold, but instead, to his surprise, he finds phosphorus. The picture has provoked many different understandings. The picture moved with Wright to Italy in 1773-1775, came back to England, was redone in 1795, but was only sold four years after his death. It is on show at the Derby Museum and Art Gallery. A story was often printed in popular chemical books in Wright’s lifetime, and was widely known.

[[Binary adder]]

CATEGORIES: Mathematics

Full adders are devices used to add binary numbers. They are used in computers. They take two binary numbers and put them together to get a sum. In its most basic form, it uses two XOR gates, two AND gates, and an OR gate. These gates figure out what the numbers being sent in mean and if the digit needs to be turned on or not. 

When solving this example: 1001 + 1100 (9 + 12 in decimal form), it would need five single bits to give an answer. The first digits in each number would go to one adder, 1 and 0. It would calculate that 1 + 0 = 1, so that first digit would be 1. The second digits from each are 0 and 0, and 0 + 0 = 0, so the second digit is 0. the third digit from each are 1 and 0, and 1 + 0 = 1, so the third digit is 1. The fourth digit in each are 1 and 1, and 1 + 1 = 10, but because this is a 2 digit number, it holds the first digit (0) and send the second digit to the next adder. The next adder sees 1, and 1 = 1, so the fifth digit is 1. If we take the sum digits in order, they come out as 10101 (21), so 1001 + 1100 = 10101 (9 + 12 = 21).

[[Arithmetic precision]]

CATEGORIES: Mathematics

The precision of a numeric value describes the number of digits that are used to show that value.  In a scientific setting, this would be the total number of digits (sometimes called the significant figures or significant digits) or, less commonly, the number of fractional digits or decimal places (the number of digits following the decimal point).  This second definition is useful in financial and engineering applications where the count of digits in the fractional part has particular importance.

In both cases, the term "precision" can be used to describe the position at which an inexact result will be rounded.  For example, in floating point arithmetic, a result is rounded to a given or fixed precision, which is the length of the resulting significand.  In financial calculations, a number is often rounded to a given number of places (for example, to two places after the decimal separator for many world currencies).

As an example, the decimal quantity 12.345 can be expressed with various numbers of significant digits or decimal places.  If insufficient precision is available then the number is rounded in some manner to fit the available precision.  The following table shows the results for various total precisions and decimal places rounded to the nearest value using the round-to-even method.

Note that it is often not appropriate to display a figure with more digits than that which can be measured. For instance, if a device measures to the nearest gram and gives a reading of 12.345 kg, it would create false precision if the measurement were expressed "12.34500 kg" with 2 extra zeroes ("00") at the end.

The representation of a positive number x to a precision of p significant digits has a numerical value that is given by the formula

For a negative number, the numerical value is minus that of the absolute value.

The number 0, to any precision, can be taken to be 0.

[[Rounding]]

CATEGORIES: Mathematics

Rounding is often done on purpose to obtain a value that is easier to write and handle than the original. It may also be done to indicate the accuracy of a computed number; for example, a quantity that was computed as 123,456, but is known to be accurate only to within a few hundred units, is better stated as "about 123,500".

On the other hand, rounding can introduce some round-off error as a result. Rounding is almost unavoidable in many computations, especially when dividing two numbers in integer or doing fixed-point arithmetic; when computing mathematical functions such as square roots, logarithms, and sines; or when using a floating point representation with a fixed number of significant digits. In a sequence of calculations, these rounding errors generally accumulate, and in certain "ill-conditioned" cases, they may make the result meaningless.

Accurate rounding of transcendental mathematical functions is difficult, because the number of extra digits that need to be calculated to resolve whether to round up or down cannot be known in advance. This problem is known as "the table-maker's dilemma" (below).

Rounding has many similarities to the quantization that occurs when physical quantities must be encoded by numbers or digital signals.

[[Shuttle]]

CATEGORIES: Tools, Weaving

A shuttle is a tool designed to neatly and compactly store weft yarn while weaving. Shuttles are thrown or passed back and forth through the shed, between the yarn threads of the warp in order to weave in the weft.

The simplest shuttles, known as "stick shuttles", are made from a flat, narrow piece of wood with notches on the ends to hold the weft yarn. More complicated shuttles incorporate bobbins or pirns.

Shuttles are often made of wood from the Flowering Dogwood, because it is so hard, resists splintering, and can be polished to a very smooth finish.

Originally shuttles were passed back and forth by hand. However, John Kay invented a loom in 1733 that incorporated a flying shuttle. This shuttle could be thrown through the warp, which allowed much wider cloth to be woven much more quickly and made the development of machine looms much simpler and easier to use.

[[Laser tag]]

CATEGORIES: Games

Laser tag, what is now considered a game, started out as a military training exercise. In the beginning laser guns and the laser targets worn on the soldiers bodies were not connected, this means that the soldiers were able to continue firing the gun even if they had been tagged. One other problem was that they could just reboot the packs, essentially getting their second life, which does not happen on the battlefield.

Laser tag does not actually use lasers for the actual tagging device, it utilizes infrared LEDs that are focused with mirrors.

Today's laser tag systems work on the following, where a sensor pack that is attached to the pack, your pack is wireless and reports back to a master computer that tabulates the amount of times that you were hit or hit someone else. When you pull the trigger, the infrared LED lights up, but the infrared can not be seen by humans. The packs sensors are actively looking for Infrared lights, if you are in range your pack will register the hit. the part of the laser tag beam that you can see is sometimes a laser or a very bright focused red LED. 

In earlier versions of laser tag the packs sensed light, this was bad, because you needed to large area to play, you were usually in view of the sun, you often got false tags with the sun.

[[Icknield Street]]

CATEGORIES: Archaeological sites in England, Roman roads in Britain

Icknield Street or Ryknild Street is a Roman road in Britain that runs from the Fosse Way at Bourton on the Water in Gloucestershire to Templeborough in South Yorkshire. It passes through Alcester, Birmingham, Lichfield and Derby.

Four Roman roads are named in the Laws of Edward the Confessor; Watling Street, Ermine Street, the Fosse Way and Hikenild (or Icknield) Street. Hikenild Street, is generally supposed to be connected with the Iceni. Various forms of the name, the earliest, in Anglo-Saxon, are Icenhilde Weg or Icenilde We. These roads are from the borders of Norfolk through Cambridgeshire, Bucks, Berks, Hants, and Wilts into Dorset. These locations however would identify the path as Icknield Way, an Iron Age trackway running from Norfolk to Dorset. 

This road got the name Ryknild Street during the 12th century when it was named by Ranulf Higdon, a monk writing in 1344 in his Polychronicon. Higdon, gives the name of the fourth road as Rikenild Strete, which, he says, tends from the south-west to the north, and begins at St. David's and continues to the mouth of the Tyne, passing Worcester, Droitwich, Birmingham, Lichfield, Derby, and Chesterfield. It has borne that name, or Rigning, Reenald, or Rignall, from early times. In three of the four MSS. of Higdon, the name is given Rikenilde, Rikenyldes, and in the fourth, which is said to be one of the earliest, Hikenil Street. Trevisa's English translation (1387) calls it Rykeneldes Street. Harverfield writing in the Victoria County History of Warwickshire doubted if the road had any real and original right to either name, preferring Ryknild as no less correct, (or no more wrong) and being able to separate it from Icknield Street in Oxfordshire and Berkshire. It is now called Icknield or Ryknild Street to separate it from the older Icknield Way. A kept part of the Roman road can be seen at Sutton Park in Birmingham.

[[Diet (nutrition)]]

CATEGORIES: Food and drink, Diets

In nutrition, diet is the sum of food that is eaten by a person or another organism. Dietary habits are the usual decisions someone or a culture makes when choosing what foods to eat. 

In discussing diet, the key issue is the change in work done. People have moved from manual work to office-type work, and to houses which have washing machines (et cetera). This has happened usually without changes in eating habits got during childhood. This is the basic reason why people get fat, with all the problems which follow. 

With the word diet, it is often expressed the use of specific intake of nutrition for health or weight-management reasons (with the two often being related). Although humans are omnivores, each culture and each person holds some food preferences or some food taboos, due to personal tastes or ethical reasons. Individual dietary choices may be more or less healthful. A proper nutrition requires a proper ingestion and, also important, the absorption of vitamins, minerals, and food energy in the form of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Dietary habits and choices play a significant role in health and mortality, and can also define cultures and play a role in religion.

Diets are about eating the right quantity and type of food at the right time. When people talk about a diet, they are usually referring to a special kind of diet. When someone says they are "dieting", it means that they are trying to lose weight. People who study diet and eating habits are called dietitians.

When the diet is not right, people can gain or lose weight. They may become overweight or underweight. To get back to their normal weight, they need to change their diet. This may be very hard to do. Often help from a specialist is required.

Some people will also do fasting - they will not eat anything for some time to lose weight, balance their diet and clean their bodies.

Some people have diseases where they cannot eat certain foods without becoming very sick. They need to change their diet to avoid these foods. A food allergy is a condition in which a specific food makes someone sick. Phenylketonuria is a disease in which a person cannot digest certain foods properly because they have an amino acid, or type of chemical, called phenylalanines in them.

A fad diet is a type of diet that becomes popular for a short time without any major health organizations recommending it.

People became very loyal to their party.  

There were two main political parties during this time period. One was the Democratic Party, led by Andrew Jackson. The other was the Whig Party, started by Henry Clay. The Whig party was made up of members of the National Republican Party and other people who opposed Jackson.

There were also a number of important minor parties. The Anti-Masonic Party (1827-34) was important in developing political ideas and laws. The Liberty Party in the 1840s was an important abolitionist party (against slavery).  The United States Free Soil Party in 1848 and 1852 was another anti-slavery party.

He played a total of 763 league games during his career, the 13th highest of all British footballers. He is now a football manager, managing Scottish Premier League side Motherwell.

McCall started his professional career with Bradford City, where he made his senior debut in 1982. He played six seasons at Valley Parade, during which time he won the Division Three championship, a title which was overshadowed by a fire at Bradford's stadium when 56 people died and his father Andy was injured. After missing out on promotion in 1987–88, McCall moved to Everton, for whom he scored twice but finished on the losing side in the 1989 FA Cup Final. In 1991, he moved to Rangers, with whom he spent seven seasons and won six league titles, three Scottish Cups and two Scottish League Cups. McCall returned to Bradford City as captain to take them into the top division of English football for the first time in 77 years. After four seasons he moved to Sheffield United, where he retired as a player in 2005.

Despite being born in Leeds, England, McCall qualified to play for Scotland through his Scottish father. He won 40 caps for his country and scored one goal in the 1990 World Cup in Italy. He also played in two European Championships but his international career ended after he was left out of the 1998 World Cup squad.

McCall was part of the coaching staff during his second spell at Bradford City, briefly serving as caretaker-player manager in 2000.

The area is part of the Barkly Tablelands, a large flat grassy plain the size of the United Kingdom, famous for its large cattle stations (farms). The first people to live in the area were the Warramunga people. 

The explorer John McDouall Stuart was the first European to visit the area in 1860, but was attacked by warriors from the Warramunga at Attack Creek. In the battle at the creek, Stuart wrote that they "took steady aim" and fired their guns at the Warramunga, but he does not mention if any were killed or injured. Stuart named Tennant Creek after a John Tennant, of Port Lincoln, South Australia.

A repeater station for the Australian Overland Telegraph Line was built 11 km north of Tennant Creek in 1872.

There was a gold rush to Tennant Creek in 1930, Australia's last gold rush. Mining is still a major activity in the area, with gold, manganese and copper mines. In 2011 the Australian government proposed building a nuclear waste dump near the town despite protests from the traditional Aboriginal land owners. The traditional owners challenged the proposal in the Federal Court in June 2014, and the Northern Land Council dropped its plans.

Benjamin Herschel Babbage (1815—1878) was an English scientist, engineer and explorer. Babbage was the son of the famous mathematician, Charles Babbage. He went to South Australia to map the geography and the location of minerals.

Babbage was very thorough, and spent a lot of time making sure that his information was correct. He carried a lot of equipment, as well as four and half tonnes of food, enough to last 18 months in the desert. Among his supplies he had 20 kilograms of chocolate and 5000 litres of water. He also took a flock of 150 sheep, which limited the speed the group could move. The government became frustrated with Babbage's slow progress, they wanted to know about possible farm lands and valuable minerals as soon as possible. Eventually Babbage was removed from the job and replaced by Major Peter Warburton.

Babbage later helped on the planning for the Australian Overland Telegraph Line. He was interested in growing grapes and retired to his large vineyard at St.Marys. He died on 20 October 1878, and is buried at St.Marys.

[[Deinococcus radiodurans]]

CATEGORIES: Gram-positive bacteria, Extremophiles

Deinococcus radiodurans is a gram-positive, nonmotile, red-pigmented bacterium. It was originally identified as a contaminant of irradiated canned meat in 1956. 

Deinococcus radiodurans has the systems for DNA repair, DNA damage export and genetic redundancy. It can recover from desiccation (loss of water) and starvation. It has a very high tolerance to radiation forms like gamma radiation.  It is so far known as the most radioactive resistant organism. Thioredoxin reductase is an enzyme found in the cells' response to double-strand DNA breaks.

D. radiodurans has a gene sequence that encodes for a protein that is very similar to the RecD enzyme found in E. coli. This significant finding suggests that this RecD-like protein in D. radiodurans is an important part of the repair system it uses. 

It may be possible to make other bacteria as radiation resistant as D. radiodurans by changing their genetics. One research team in China is trying to insert an expressive recombinant Mn-SOD protein from D. radiodurans into E.coli BL21. The real challenge here is making the protein self-sustaining in the new species. The team has "provided the foundations for further studies and applications of the recombinant Mn-SOD".

[[Kitchen stove]]

CATEGORIES: Cooking appliances

A kitchen stove, cooking stove, cookstove, or cooker is a kitchen appliance designed for cooking food. 

Stoves use direct heat for cooking and have an oven for baking. The design uses wood, coke or anthracite for fuel. The basic idea is that the stove completely encloses the fire inside its iron body. There are still many traditional stoves made, which burn wood or solid fuel. Many also have back boilers for domestic heating.

Gas stoves are different, because they have open flames on top of the stove, whereas the original stoves have hidden flames. Modern gas stoves were developed already in the 1820s, but these were isolated experiments. At the Great Exhibition in London in 1851, a gas stove was shown, but only in the 1880s did this technology start to become a commercial success. The main factor in this delay was the slow growth of the gas pipe network. Gas and electric stoves have largely replaced solid fuel stoves.

The 2011 Vancouver Stanley Cup riot was a riot that took place on June 15, 2011 in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

The riot took place after the Boston Bruins defeated the Vancouver Canucks in Game 7 of the 2011 Stanley Cup Finals. It happened immediately after the Bruins defeated the Canucks. There were at least 140 people that were reported as being injured in the incident, one critically and at least four people were stabbed. Close to 100 people were arrested.

People were angry over the result of the final game and threw objects at the large screens that were at the viewing area. They set fire to Boston Bruins flags, overturned and set fire to two vehicles in front of the main Canada Post headquarters. There were reports of similar car fires in a nearby parking garage that included two police cruisers. The rioters smashed windows and looted stores. The riot ended around midnight when people in the crowd either went home or were arrested. The mayor of Vancouver, Gregor Robertson, called the rioters "a small group of troublemakers". Several of the participants in the riot turned themselves in to the police after their faces were shown on TV, including the person responsible for setting the first car on fire. According to CBC News, the destruction caused by the rioters was worse than the riot that followed the Canucks loss in Game 7 of the 1994 Stanley Cup Finals, especially the looting aspect.

[[Tanami Desert]]

CATEGORIES: Deserts of Australia

The Tanami Desert is a desert in the Northern Territory of Australia. It is rocky with small hills, an arid and isolated area that was not fully explored until well into the twentieth century. It is crossed by the Tanami Track. The explorer John McDouall Stuart made repeated attempts to cross the desert in the 1860's while trying to reach the Victoria River. He was unable to find water.

Under the name Tanami, it is one of the Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation for Australia (IBRA) regions. The desert is uniquely "one of the most important biological areas to be found in Australia particularly as it provides refuge for several of Australia's rare and endangered species." 

The species that are found include:

[[Ludwig Leichhardt]]

CATEGORIES: 1813 births, 1848 deaths, Exploration of Australia, Australian explorers, Missing people, German people

Friedrich Wilhelm Ludwig Leichardt (1813—1848) was a German naturalist and explorer who explored the north of Australia. In 1844 Leichhardt led a small group from Moreton Bay in the south east corner of Queensland west to Port Essington in the Northern Territory. This was a trip of 4,828 km. They returned to Sydney by boat. He was presented with the Patrons Gold Medal by the Royal Geographical Society in London.

In 1848 he set out to cross the continent from east to west. He believed he could go north around the deserts to the coast of Western Australia, and then follow the coast south to the Swan River. After leaving the Darling Downs, Leichhardt's group disappeared. Many people searched, and there were stories about marked trees, or found items, but nothing was proved. 

In 2006 a small piece of brass with Leichhardt's name on it proved to be a genuine item from the explorer. It had been found in 1900 by an Aboriginal stockman in Western Australia, close to the Northern Territory border, in the area between the Great Sandy Desert and the Tanami Desert.

[[Taxis]]

CATEGORIES: Physiology

A taxis (plural taxes) is an innate behavioral response by an organism to a directional stimulus. This means the organism automatically moves towards or away from the stimulus.

A taxis differs from a tropism (turning response, often plant growth towards or away from a stimulus) in that the organism has motility and shows movement towards or away from the stimulus source.

Even single-celled organisms can show taxis.

[[Euclid's Elements]]

CATEGORIES: Mathematics books

Euclid's ''Elements (sometimes: The Elements, Στοιχεῖα Stoicheia) is a large set of math books about geometry, written by the ancient Greek mathematician known as Euclid (c.325 BC–265 BC) in Alexandria (Egypt) circa 300 BC. The set has 13 volumes, or sections, and has been printed often as 13 physical books (numbered I-XIII), rather than one large book. It has been translated into Latin, with the title "Euclidis Elementorum"''. It is the most famous mathmetical text from ancient times.

Euclid collected together all that was known of geometry in his time. His Elements is the main source of ancient geometry. Textbooks based on Euclid have been used up to the present day. In the book, he starts out from a small set of axioms (that is, a group of things that everyone thinks are true). Euclid then shows the properties of geometric objects and of whole numbers, based on those axioms.

The Elements also includes works on perspective, conic sections, spherical geometry, and possibly quadric surfaces. Apart from geometry, the work also includes number theory. Euclid came up with the idea of greatest common divisors. They were in his Elements. The greatest common divisor of two numbers is the greatest number that can divide evenly into both of the two numbers.

The geometrical system described in the Elements was long known simply as "geometry" and was considered to be the only geometry possible. Today, that system is referred to as Euclidean geometry, to distinguish it from other so-called non-Euclidean geometries which mathematicians discovered in the 19th century.

[[Common descent]]

CATEGORIES: Evolutionary biology

In evolutionary biology, a group of organisms have common descent if they have a common ancestor. There is strong support for the theory that all living organisms on Earth are descended from a common ancestor.

Charles Darwin proposed the theory of universal common descent through an evolutionary process in On the Origin of Species, saying, "There is a grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one".p490

The last universal ancestor (LUA) (or last universal common ancestor, LUCA), that is viewed by evolutionary theory to be  most recent common ancestor of all currently living organisms, is believed to have appeared about 3.9 billion years ago.

[[Accuracy and precision]]

CATEGORIES: Critical thinking, Measurement

The accuracy and precision of measurements have special meanings in the fields of science, engineering, industry and statistics. 

A measurement system can be accurate but not precise, precise but not accurate, neither, or both. For example, if an experiment contains a error in the way it is done, then increasing the sample size generally increases precision but does not improve accuracy. The end result would be a consistent, yet inaccurate, set of results from the flawed experiment.  Eliminating the systematic error improves accuracy but does not change precision.

A measurement system is valid if it is both accurate and precise. Related terms include bias (non-random or directed effects caused by a factor or factors unrelated to the independent variable) and error (random variability).

[[Humidex]]

CATEGORIES: Weather measurements, Meteorology, 1979 establishments in Canada

The humidex ("Hyu-mah-deks") is a temperature index used by Canadian meteorologists to describe how hot the weather feels to a person, by adding the effect of heat and humidity. For example, if the temperature is 30 and the calculated humidex is 40, then that means the humid heat feels like a dry temperature of 40. The index is widely used in Canadian weather reports during summer to give the discomfort level.

According to the Meteorological Service of Canada, a humidex of at least 30 causes "some discomfort", at least 40 causes "great discomfort" and above 45 is "dangerous". When the humidex hits 54, then heat stroke is very near.

The current formula for getting the humidex (see below: Humidex formula) was developed by J.M. Masterton and F.A. Richardson of Canada's Atmospheric Environment Service in 1979. The humidex differs from the heat index used in the United States, in being derived from the dew point rather than the relative humidity.

The record highest humidex in Canada occurred on July 25, 2007, when Carman, Manitoba hit 53.0. That number broke the previous record of 52.1 set during 1953 in Windsor, Ontario (The residents of Windsor would not have known it at the time, since the humidex had yet to be invented).

[[Heat index]]

CATEGORIES: Weather measurements, Meteorology, 1978 establishments

The "heat index" (HI, also "humiture") is a measurement which combines air temperature and relative humidity as being the human-perceived equivalent temperature — how hot it feels. The result is also known as the "felt air temperature" or "apparent temperature". For example, when the temperature is 90 with very high humidity, the heat index can be about 105.

The human body normally cools itself by perspiration, or sweating, which evaporates and carries heat away from the body. However, when the relative humidity is high, then the evaporation rate is reduced, so heat is removed from the body at a lower rate, causing it to retain more heat than it would in dry air. Measurements have been taken based on subjective descriptions of how hot subjects feel for a given temperature and humidity, allowing an index to be made which relates one temperature and humidity combination, to another, at a higher temperature in drier air.

The heat index was developed in 1978 by George Winterling as the "humiture" and was adopted by the National Weather Service a year later. It is derived from work carried out by Robert G. Steadman. Like the wind chill index, the heat index contains assumptions about the human body mass and height, clothing, amount of physical activity, thickness of blood, sunlight and ultraviolet radiation exposure, and the wind speed. Large deviations from the typical values will result in heat-index values which do not accurately reflect the perceived temperature.

In Canada, the similar humidex is used in place of the heat index. The humidex differs from the heat index in using the dew point rather than the relative humidity.

The heat index is defined so as to equal the actual air temperature when the partial pressure of water vapor is equal to a baseline value of 1.6 kPa. At standard atmospheric pressure (101.325 kPa), this baseline corresponds to a dew point of 14 °C (57 °F) and a mixing ratio of 0.01 (10 g of water vapor per kilogram of dry air). This corresponds to an air temperature of 25°C and relative humidity of 50% in the sea-level psychrometric chart.

At high temperatures, the level of relative humidity needed to make the heat index higher than the actual temperature is lower than at cooler temperatures. For example, at approximately 27 °C (80 °F), the heat index will agree with the actual temperature if the relative humidity is 45%, but at about 43°C (110°F), any relative-humidity reading above 17% will make the Heat Index higher than 43°C (110 °F).

The heat index is calculated only if the actual temperature is above 27 °C (80 °F), dew point temperatures greater than 12 °C (54 °F), and relative humidities higher than 40%. The heat index and humidex figures are based on temperature measurements taken in the shade and not the sun, so extra care must be taken while in the sun.

Sometimes the heat index and the wind chill are denoted collectively by the single terms "apparent temperature" or "relative outdoor temperature".

[[Great White Spot]]

CATEGORIES: Saturn

The Great White Spot, also known as Great White Oval, on Saturn, is a name given to storms that are large enough to be seen by telescope from Earth. The spots appear to be white, and the name was based on Jupiter's Great Red Spot. The spots can be several thousands of kilometers wide. Currently, a large band of white clouds called the Northern Electrostatic Disturbance (because of an increase in radio and plasma interference) has covered Saturn since 2010, and the Cassini orbiter is tracking the storm. Cassini information shows a loss of acetylene in the white clouds, an increase of phosphine, and an unusual temperature drop in the center of the storm. In April 2011, the storm had a second eruption. Scientists believe the white spots are made from ammonia ice pushed up by warmer gas through the tops of the planet's clouds.211-12

The crow tries to push the pitcher over but fails to do so. It drops pebbles in the pitcher, one by one, until the water rises to the top of the pitcher which allows the crow to drink. Avianus follows the fable with a moral that emphasizes the virtue of ingenuity: "This fable shows us that thoughtfulness is superior to brute strength."

[[Independent sources]]

CATEGORIES: Journalism

The term "multiple independent sources" in journalism, criminal justice, science and general research, are two or more unconnected people, organizations, or objects which provide a given set of information or samples. For example, two separate people who see a traffic accident, at the spot, could be considered independent sources. However, if one person saw the accident and told the other one about it, then they would not be independent, since one would depend on the other for their information. Also, if two witnesses to an event discuss what they saw before they are asked about it and agree to tell the same story, then they are also no longer independent. As another example, two scientific devices could be considered independent sources of measurement data, unless they shared the same wiring or electrical power supply (or similar factors).

Consulting multiple independent sources is a common technique for detecting errors and deception, as any divergences or contradictions between statements, or data samples, would likely indicate one of these.

Famously, the New York Times'  minimal standard for reporting a fact not otherwise attributed to a single speaker is that it be verified by at least two independent sources.

Circular reporting is a situation where multiple sources appear to be independent, but in reality originate from a single source.  Because circular reporting can happen inadvertently in many situations, extra care must be taken to ensure that multiple sources actually are independent, rather than interconnected in an obscure manner.

[[Barycenter]]

CATEGORIES: Astronomy

The barycenter (or barycentre; from the Greek βαρύκεντρον) is the point between two objects where they balance each other. For example, it is the center of mass where two or more planets orbit each other. When a moon orbits a planet, or a planet orbits a star, both bodies are actually orbiting around a point that lies outside the center of the larger body. For example, the moon does not orbit the exact center of the Earth. It actually orbits a point on a line between the center of the Earth and the Moon. This is about 1,710 km below the surface of the Earth. This is the point where the mass of the moon and the mass of the Earth balance. This is the point about which the Earth and Moon orbit as they travel around the Sun.

The solar system of course also has a barycenter—depending on the current locations of the planets the barycenter of the solar system is below the surface of the sun or more than twice the sun’s diameter outside of the sun's surface.

Also the barycenter exists in the world of geometry. For example, the circle has a barycenter.

[[Secret sharing]]

CATEGORIES: Cryptography

Secret sharing is used as a term to refer to ways of sharing a secret among many people. Each person knows part of the secret that is shared, but a number of people need to cooperate to rebuild the secret. The knowledge of one person alone is not enough to reconstruct the secret. Adi Shamir and George Blakley developed the method independently of each other, in 1979.

One example where secret sharing is used is the RSA cryptosystem. It uses a secret key. If this key is distributed among many people, no single person can make a signature. Even if the part of one person is revealed or lost, a number of them can still make a signature. This is often used is areas where security is very important, such as banks, or the military.

The dealer hands each player their part of the secret. In an easier setup, the parts of the players can be combined to form the secret, but with each part there is extra information. Say that a secret needs five parts, and three parts are known. In this setup, guessing the two parts that are missing will be easier than guessing the secret awhen no parts are known. The other setup is said to be secure from the point of view of information theory, because knowing part of the required number of player parts will not change how difficult it is to guess the secret. 

There are different methods of secure secret sharing techniques.

[[Periodic comet]]

CATEGORIES: Comets

A periodic comet is a comet which orbits around the Sun. A short-period comet will complete its orbit in less than 200 years. A long-period comet will take more than 200 years to orbit. In most cases the comets are named after the person who discovered them. The Shoemaker-Levy comets were named after Eugene Shoemaker, Carolyn Shoemaker and David Levy. A few comets are named after the person who calculated the orbits, such as 2P/Encke and 27P/Crommelin. It is very difficult to work out the orbit of a long-period comet because the orbit changes. The gravity of planets, or the release of gas or material from the comet itself, changes the orbit. Short-period comets can be predicted very accurately.

Periodic comets sometimes have the same name, for example there are nine Shoemaker-Levy comets and twenty-four NEAT comets. The Minor Planet Center, a part of the International Astronomical Union gives comets a different number prefix or uses the full title such as 181P/Shoemaker-Levy and 192/Shoemaker-Levy which are both "Comet Shoemaker-Levy". Sometimes an informal numbering system is used for periodic comets so 181P is Comet Shoemaker-Levy 6 and 192P is Comet Shoemaker-Levy 1. Because non-periodic Shoemaker-Levy comets are included in the number sequences there appear to be gaps in the numbers, for example C/1991 B1 is between Shoemaker-Levy 2 and 3, C/1991 T2 is between 5 and 6, C/1993 K1 and D/1994 E2 after Shoemaker-Levy 9.

In naming a comet, the letter before the "/" is:

Some lists keep the "C" prefix for comets of with orbits longer than about 30 years until their return is confirmed.

[[Bayeux Tapestry]]

CATEGORIES: History of the British Isles, Needlework

The Bayeux Tapestry is a 0.5 long embroidered cloth – not an actual tapestry – which depicts the events leading up to the Norman conquest of England as well as the events of the invasion itself. The tapestry is annotated in Latin. It is exhibited in a special museum in Bayeux, Normandy called Musée de la Tapisserie de Bayeux.

The tapestry tells the story of the Norman conquest of England. The two combatants are the Anglo-Saxon English, led by Harold Godwinson, recently crowned as King of England, and the Normans, led by William the Conqueror.

The tapestry is regarded as one of the greatest examples of Anglo-Saxon art, because, though ordered by a Norman, it was made by English (Anglo-Saxon) artisans. It is also extremely important as a historical document.

In common with other embroidered hangings of the early medieval period, this piece is conventionally referred to as a "tapestry", although it is not a true tapestry in which the design is woven into the cloth; it is in fact an embroidery.

The Bayeux tapestry is embroidered in wool yarn on a tabby-woven linen ground using two methods of stitching: outline or stem stitch for lettering and the outlines of figures, and couching or laid work for filling in figures. The linen is assembled in panels and has been patched in numerous places.

The main yarn colours are terracotta or russet, blue-green, dull gold, olive green, and blue, with small amounts of dark blue or black and sage green.

[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]

CATEGORIES: Anglo-Saxons, Medieval literature

[[File:Peterborough.Chronicle.firstpage.jpg|thumb|228px|right|The initial page of the Peterborough Chronicle.

Translation of this scanned page. ]]

The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle is a collection of annals in Old English chronicling the history of the Anglo-Saxons. The annals were initially created late in the 9th century, probably in Wessex, during the reign of Alfred the Great. Multiple manuscript copies were made and distributed to monasteries across England and were independently updated. In one case, the chronicle was still being actively updated in 1154.

Nine manuscripts survive in whole or in part, though not all are of equal historical value and none of them is the original version. The oldest seems to have been started towards the end of Alfred's reign, while the most recent was written at Peterborough Abbey after a fire at that monastery in 1116. 

Almost all of the material in the chronicle is in the form of annals, by year; the earliest are dated at 60 BC, and historical material follows up to the year in which the chronicle was written, at which point contemporary records begin. These manuscripts collectively are known as the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle.

The Chronicle is not unbiased: there are occasions when comparison with other medieval sources makes it clear that the scribes who wrote it omitted events or told one-sided versions of stories; there are also places where the different versions contradict each other. 

Taken as a whole the Chronicle is the single most important historical source for the period in England between the end of Roman rule in Britain and the decades following the Norman Conquest. Much of the information given in the Chronicle is not recorded elsewhere. In addition, the manuscripts are important sources for the history of the English language; in particular, the later Peterborough Chronicle is one of the earliest examples of Middle English in existence.

Seven of the nine surviving manuscripts and fragments are now in the British Library. The remaining two are in the Bodleian Library at Oxford and the Parker Library of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge.

The first fossil of Dicraeosaurus was discovered in 1914.

[[Food Power]]

CATEGORIES: Politics

In politics, the use of agriculture or agricultural products to influence the outcome of decisions is called Food Power. Several nations with crude oil have organised themselves and founded a cartel called OPEC. Through this cartel, they can fix the price at which they will sell oil. Food power works in much the same way. Nations usually do what is best for their citizens, who usually want food. 

Food power is part of food politics. Embargoes can also be used to put pressure on a nation. In order for a nation to make use of food power effectively, the nation must effectively apply and display scarcity, supply concentration, demand dispersion, and action independence. The four main nations that export enough agriculture to be able to exert food power are the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. The U.S. does appear to use food power for punishment. Some African countries have used food power in internal conflicts on a smaller scale.

[[Arecibo message]]

CATEGORIES: Astronomy, Radio, Communication, 1974 in the United States, 20th century in Puerto Rico

The Arecibo message was a short radio message sent into space to celebrate the remodeling of the Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico in 1974. It was aimed at the globular star cluster M13, about 25,000 light years from Earth. M13 was chosen because it was the right size, and was in the sky at the right time and place for the ceremony. 

Dr. Frank Drake, then at Cornell University and creator of the famous Drake equation, wrote the message, with help from Carl Sagan, among others. The message was in seven parts which show:

It will take 25,000 years for the message to reach the stars, and at least another 25,000 years to get any reply. This means the Arecibo message was a show of human technological achievement, not a real attempt to talk to extraterrestrial life.  The stars of M13 that the message was aimed at will no longer be in that location when the message arrives. Cornell University said on November 12, 1999, the real purpose of the message was not to make contact, but to show the power of the new equipment. (Cornell University had built and operated the radio telescope for the United States National Science Foundation.)

The message consisted of 1679 binary digits, about 210 bytes. It was transmitted at a frequency of 2380 MHz and modulated by shifting the frequency by 10 Hz, with a power of 1000 kW. The "ones" and "zeros" were transmitted by frequency shifting at the rate of 10 bits per second. The total broadcast was less than three minutes.

The cardinality of 1679 was chosen because it is a semiprime. It can be arranged as a rectangle of 73 rows by 23 columns. The other arrangement, 23 rows by 73 columns, does not produce a meaningful result. The message forms the image shown on the right, or its inverse, when translated into graphics characters and spaces.

In 2009 the band Boxcutter made an album called the Arecibo Message, which has a lot of short songs.

Shortly before the coaster was built, the name was changed to Superman the Ride and was painted red and blue. Since 2005 the coaster is called Xpress. It is the first LSM coaster in Europe.

The coaster had been standing but not operating for the whole season in 2011. The reason for this was because important parts of the launch mechanism were broken, which can cause that the train does not have enough speed at the end of the launch, or doesn't launch at all. These parts are ordered and are only made on request, as there are only 3 coasters of this type worldwide (2 of which are in Disney parks). Therefore, Walibi Holland decided to paint the track. As of 2012, the coaster operates again.

CATEGORIES: Gymnastics, Human skills, Yoga

A handstand is the act of holding the body upside down balancing on the hands. The body is held straight with arms and legs fully extended. The hands are placed about shoulder-width apart. A handstand performer must have balance and upper body strength.

Handstands are used in many activities, including acro dance, acrobatics, cheerleading and gymnastics. Some types of handstand are performed on all gymnastic equipment. Many tumbling skills pass through a handstand position as part of the action. Breakdancers use handstands in freezes and kicks. Sometimes a handstand is used as a starting position for diving. In games or contests, swimmers will sometimes do underwater handstands on pool bottoms with legs and feet extended above the water.

Handstands are known by various other names. In yoga, the handstand is known as Adho Mukha Vrksasana (pronounced AHD-hoh MOOK-hah vrik-SHAH-sah-nah) translating to Downward-facing Tree Pose, and in capoeira it is named bananeira.

[[Globular cluster]]

CATEGORIES: Star clusters

A globular cluster is a group of stars of a similar age which often orbits the central bulge of a galaxy. Gravity holds clusters together and gives them their spherical shape. Towards the centre of a clusters there are many stars in a relatively small space. 

Globular clusters occur in the halo of a galaxy and in its disk. Those in the halo contain many more stars and are much older than the less dense open clusters in the disk. Globular clusters are fairly common: there are about 150 to 158 known globular clusters in the Milky Way. Large galaxies can have more: Andromeda may have as many as 500. 

Some giant elliptical galaxies, particularly those at the centres of galaxy clusters, such as M87, have as many as 13,000 globular clusters. These globular clusters orbit the galaxy out to huge distances, 40 kiloparsecs (approximately 131,000 light-years) or more.

Every galaxy of sufficient mass in the Local Group has its group of globular clusters, and almost every large galaxy surveyed has  a system of globular clusters. The Sagittarius Dwarf and Canis Major Dwarf galaxies appear to be in the process of donating their associated globular clusters (such as Palomar 12) to the Milky Way. This demonstrates how many of this galaxy's globular clusters might have been acquired in the past.

The first half of Dreaming of You contains mid-tempo R&B ballads and pop songs, while the rest of Dreaming of You contains Latin music.

By 1993, EMI Latin believed Selena was ready to release a crossover album.

[[Rings of Jupiter]]

CATEGORIES: Jupiter

The Rings of Jupiter are a number of rings which circle the planet Jupiter. It was the third set of rings found in the Solar System after the rings found around Saturn and Uranus. The rings are very difficult to see from Earth, needing the most powerful telescopes. They were not discovered until the Voyager 1 space probe visited the planet in 1979. The Galileo space probe carried out more studies in the 1990s. The Hubble Space Telescope and large Earth telescopes have provided information recently.

The ring system is faint and is made mainly of dust. It has four main parts: a thick inner ring known as the "halo" ring, a bright but very thin "main" ring, and two outer, wide, faint "gossamer" rings. These gossamer rings are made from dust from the moons Amalthea and Thebe and have been name after them. They are known as gossamer rings because they are transparent, or "see through".

[[Vulcanoid asteroid]]

CATEGORIES: Asteroids

Vulcanoid asteroids are a special group of asteroids which may orbit close to the Sun, closer than the orbit of the planet Mercury. No vulcanoid has ever been discovered; it is not known if they ever existed. Because they would orbit so close to the Sun they could only be seen during twilight, or a solar eclipse. Their very small size could make them impossible to see. This part of the Solar System is described as being gravitationally stable, and every other similar stable area has asteroids. If they do exist, vulcanoids would be made of material that could help explain the formation of the planets. If they do not exist, then theories about how the planets were formed might have to change. They are called vulcanoids after a planet, Vulcan, which early astronomers thought they had seen close to the Sun.

[[Damocloid]]

CATEGORIES: Asteroids

A damocloid is an asteroid that takes a long time to orbit the Sun. They are very similar to the periodic comets, like Halley's Comet, but a damocloid does not have a tail like a comet. They are believed to be comets that have lost their volatile material and are dormant. Scientists think that they come from the Oort cloud. This is because some damocloids, such as C/2001 OG108 (LONEOS), later developed tails and became comets. Some damocloids also orbit in the same direction as comets, which is the opposite direction to asteroids. By January 2010, scientists had found 41 damocloids.

[[Copy editing]]

CATEGORIES: Writing, Publishing

Copy editing, or sub-editing, is the work an editor does to improve the style or accuracy of a text. The revised text should be more readable and sometimes more interesting after the editing. Also, punctuation and grammar may need correcting, but without changing the writer's general style.

Copy editing might not involve changing the substance of the text, unless supposed facts need correction. The word 'copy' refers to written or typewritten text for typesetting, printing, or publication. Copy editing is usually done before typesetting and proofreading. Proofreading is the last step in the editing process.

In the United States and Canada, an editor who does this work is called a copy editor, and an organization's highest-ranking copy editor, or the supervising editor of a group of copy editors, may be known as the copy chief, copy desk chief, or news editor. 

In book publishing in the United Kingdom and other parts of the world that follow UK nomenclature, the term 'copy editor' is also used, but in newspaper and magazine publishing, the term is 'sub-editor' and commonly shortened to 'sub' or 'subbie'. As the 'sub' suggests, UK copy editors usually have less authority than regular editors. 'Editors' in book publishing generally have a responsibility for choosing authors and titles which will make for good sales. In magazines and newspapers they are executives, responsible for the business success of the enterprise.

[[Reed (plant)]]

CATEGORIES: Poales

Reed is the general botanical term used for tall, grass-like plants of wet places. They occur in reed beds. They are all members of the order Poales.

Reeds are many polyphyletic species, which have all adapted to this wet habitat by convergent evolution.

Phragmites australis, the common reed, is used in many areas for thatching rooves (roofs). When thatched rooves were common, rivers were harvested for reeds every year. The reeds were stored in barns, and purchased by roofers for thatching.  In the United Kingdom, common reed used for this purpose is known as "Norfolk reed" or "water reed". However, "wheat reed" and "Devon reed" are not reeds but long-stemmed wheat straw.

In Britain, thatching began to be less used in the early 19th century. It was replaced by slates from quarries in Wales. Later still, slate tiles were replaced by the cheaper mass-manufactured plastic tiles.

[[Ecological genetics]]

CATEGORIES: Classical genetics, Ecology

Ecological genetics is the study of genetics and evolution in natural populations.  

This contrasts with classical genetics, which works mostly on crosses between laboratory strains, and DNA sequence analysis, which studies genes at the molecular level.  

Research in ecological genetics is on traits  related to fitness, which affect an organism's survival and reproduction. Examples might be: flowering time, drought tolerance, polymorphism, mimicry, defence against predators. 

Research usually involve a mixture of field and laboratory studies. Samples of natural populations may be taken back to the laboratory for their genetic variation to be analysed. Changes in the populations at different times and places will be noted, and the pattern of mortality in these populations will be studied. Research is often done on insects and other organisms that have short generation times.

[[Most common words in English]]

CATEGORIES: Language-related lists, English language, Words

This list of the most common words in English has been produced by Oxford University Press. By "words" is meant dictionary head words or lemmas.

It is based on an analysis of a body of over a billion words. It represents a study done by Oxford Online, associated with the Oxford English Dictionary. 

This source includes writings of all sorts from "literary novels and specialist journals to everyday newspapers and magazines and from Hansard to the language of chatrooms, emails, and weblogs", unlike some sources which use texts from only specific sources.

The Reading Teachers Book of Lists claims that the first 25 words make up about one-third of all printed material in English, and that the first 100 make up about one-half of all written material.

Note that the items listed may represent more than one actual word; they are lemmas. For instance the entry "be" contains within it the occurrences of "are", "is", "were" and "was". Note also that these top 100 lemmas listed below account for 50% of all the words in the Oxford English Corpus.

[[St Bartholomew's Church, Themar]]

CATEGORIES: Buildings and structures in Thuringia, Churches in Germany

It belongs to the most richly equipped churches of the upper valley of the Werra. It is one of the few buildings of the small town, first mentioned in 796, which outlasted all storms of the time. The Oberkirche (upper church) at the upper gate and the Unterkirche (lower church) at the Werra were the first places of worship in the place. Of the Roman Unterkirche there still exist some remainders in the vestry and in both lower floors of the church tower.

Pope Sixtus IV gave permission for the restoration of the church on 14th of May 1484 with countess Margaretha von Henneberg intermediating.

On 3rd of May 1488 the Chorherr (canon regular) of the Premonstratensian monastery Veßra and minister of Themar Antonius König founded the building of today's church. In 1502 the hall church in late Gothic style was completed.

The Protestant Reformation was introduced to Themar on 5th of October 1544 by the count Ernst von Henneberg. After the Reformation the church received several smaller carved altars from other churches.  Since 1541 the church building was frequently converted in the course of the next decades.

The barrel vault and the two matroneums were inserted, whose support beams were decorated with beautiful Bartmannsköpfe (sculptures). Similar sculptures can be found in the churches of Rohr and Herpf near Meiningen.

At the columns the matroneums were decorated with sculptures of saints and apostles, partially from older Gothic altar works and with famous verses from the bible.

[[Horse training]]

CATEGORIES: Horses

Horse training describes what people do to get horses to do particular tasks. This includes training them to let people ride on their backs, or to pull carts and wagons. Horses have to be trained to accept a bridle or a saddle. Historically, horses were trained for transport, farm work, warfare and sport.

[[Proxy]]

Proxy has different meanings when talking about different subjects:

[[Proxy murder]]

CATEGORIES: Murders

A proxy murder is when a person murders on behalf of someone else. Proxy comes from the Latin word procuratio which means to take care of.

An example of this would be an assassin killing for money.  Another example would be a person that convinces someone that loves them to kill another person for them. Another example was in prisons where criminals in prison would act as the executioner for people sentenced to death. Lady Betty (1750—1807) was a famous hangwoman and prisoner in the Roscommon Gaol. The Nazis used proxy killings in World War II when they got prisoners to shoot Jewish prisoners instead of doing it themselves. The prisoners were told if they did not do it they would be shot as well.

A documentary movie was made in 2009 looking at mass killings in the US. It is called Murder by Proxy.

[[Greenstone belt]]

CATEGORIES: Metamorphic rocks

Greenstone belts are large regions of very ancient metamorphosed volcanic rocks. The name comes from the green colour of the minerals in the rocks. Chlorite, actinolite and other green amphiboles are the typical green minerals.

Greenstone belts were originally formed of igneous rocks, such as basalt. The belts formed at ancient oceanic spreading centers and in volcanic island arcs. They may be several thousand kilometres long. Later, they were metamophosed, with minor sedimentary rocks in-between the volcanic formations. 

Those greenstone belts which formed in ancient oceans are now found on land in Archaean and Proterozoic cratons between granite and gneiss bodies. 

The rocks are mafic, meaning they are high in magnesium and silica.

[[Craton]]

CATEGORIES: Plate tectonics

A craton is the oldest part of a continental plate. It is an old and stable part of the continental lithosphere. 

After surviving cycles of merging and rifting of continents, cratons are usually found in the interiors of tectonic plates. They are composed of ancient crystalline basement rock, which may be covered by younger sedimentary rock. They have a thick crust and deep roots that extend as much as several hundred kilometers into the Earth's mantle.

Cratonic lithosphere is much older than oceanic lithosphere – up to 4 billion years versus 180 million years.

The term craton is used to distinguish the stable portion of the continental crust from regions that are more geologically active and unstable. Cratons can be described as shields, in which the basement rock crops out at the surface, and platforms, in which the basement is overlain by sediments and sedimentary rock.

Cratons are subdivided geographically into geologic provinces. A geologic province is an area with common geologic properties.

[[Petrology]]

His armies overcame the armies of the Gallic Empire and the Palmyrene Empire (two Roman states that formed during the Crisis of the Third Century). Aurelian joined the Roman Empire into one state again, and this was the beginning of the end of the Crisis of the Third Century. 

While he was emperor, Aurelian overcame the armies of several groups of barbarians – the Goths, Vandals, Juthungi, Sarmatians, and Carpi. Aurelian increased the importance the god Sol Invictus in Roman religion and he built a temple for the god in the city of Rome. For the first time in many centuries, Rome needed a defensive wall to keep out enemies who might attack it. Aurelian's government started to build the Aurelian Walls around Rome. Aurelian's wife, Ulpia Severina, was his none (empress) after summer 274. Aurelian was murdered by some of his soldiers in autumn 275.

[[Zoonosis]]

CATEGORIES: Zoonoses, Diseases caused by bacteria, Diseases caused by protozoa, Diseases caused by viruses, Diseases spread by insects

Zoonosis or a zoonotic disease is an infectious disease which an animal can give to a human.  These diseases may be caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, or parasites.

Zoonotic diseases are very common.  About 60% of all infectious diseases in humans are spread by animals.

Zoonotic diseases can be spread in different ways.  They may be spread from a sick animal directly to a human  for example, through bites and infected saliva (like with rabies), or through the air.  This is called direct zoonosis.

Zoonotic diseases can also be spread through a vector.  This is an animal that carries the pathogen that causes the disease without getting infected.  Diseases like this are called vector-borne diseases.

Sometimes the vector picks up the disease from another animal.  For example, rats who have the bubonic plague do not directly infect humans.  Instead, fleas bite the rats and pick up the bacteria that causes plague without getting sick.  Then, if the flea bites a human, they can pass the bacteria on to the human, and the human can get the plague.  The rat is the host of the disease, and the flea is the vector.

[[Afsharid dynasty]]

CATEGORIES: History of Azerbaijan, Royal dynasties, 18th century in Asia

The Afsharid dynasty (Persian: افشاریان‎) was an Iranian dynasty that originated from the Afshar Turkoman tribe  in Iran's north-eastern province of Khorasan, ruling Iran (Persia) in the mid-eighteenth century. The dynasty was founded in 1736 by the brilliant military commander Nader Shah, who deposed the last member of the Safavid dynasty and proclaimed himself as the Shah of Iran.

At its height it controlled modern-day Iran, Armenia, Georgia, Azerbaijan Republic, parts of the North Caucasus (Dagestan), Afghanistan, Bahrain, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Pakistan, and parts of Iraq, Turkey, United Arab Emirates and Oman. After his death, most of his empire was divided between the Zands, Durranis, Georgians, and the Caucasian khanates, while Afsharid rule was confined to a small local state in Khorasan. Finally, the Afsharid dynasty was overthrown by Mohammad Khan Qajar in 1796, who would establish a new native Iranian empire and restore Iranian suzerainty over several of the aforementioned regions.

The dynasty was named after the Turcoman Afshar tribe from Khorasan in north-east Iran, to which Nader belonged. The Afshars had originally migrated from Turkestan to Azerbaijan (Iranian Azerbaijan) in the 13th century. In the early 17th century, Shah Abbas the Great moved many Afshars from Azerbaijan to Khorasan to defend the north-eastern borders of his state against the Uzbeks, after which the Afshars settled in those regions. Nader belonged to the Qereqlu branch of the Afshars.

[[Polymerase chain reaction]]

CATEGORIES: Molecular biology

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a way to make many copies of a sequence of DNA (this is sometimes called 'amplifying' the DNA). It is done in a lab, using an enzyme called DNA polymerase. It is called chain reaction because the result of one cycle is used immediately for the next cycle. This allows exponential growth to happen. 

PCR has many uses in a biological or biochemical setting. Because DNA is unique for every living thing, experimenters can often extract only small amounts of the DNA they are interested in from a specimen. These amounts are usually too little to be useful, and so a scientist will use PCR to make enough copies to start experimenting with. For this reason, it is one of the most common techniques used in genetics labs around the world, making it useful in experiments on many things, including gene therapy, infectious diseases, and even forensics.

This process was developed in 1983 by Kary Mullis. He was not the first person to develop the PCR process, but he was the first  to make the process usable. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry  for his work in the PCR process. It was a joint award, the other scientist being Michael Smith, who worked on a related project.

[[Atrax]]

CATEGORIES: Spiders

Atrax is a genus of spiders. They have very strong venom. These spiders aggressively defend their territory and chase off attackers who may scare them by making a threat display. Next they will bite. The fastest death occurred in 1927 when a young boy died within fifteen minutes of being bitten. Thirteen deaths were recorded in the fifty years before antivenom was invented for this spider's bite. In English they are sometimes called Sydney Funnel Web spiders because they come from around that part of Australia.

Under the heading "spiders" (Aranae) there are three main groups. One is so very old that only a few species still live on earth. Another is the group that includes the spiders that can be seen making webs or chasing prey almost everywhere in the world. The third group includes the tarantulas and a few other kinds of spiders. The Atrax spiders belong to this third group.

There are also species called "funnel-web spiders" that belong to the second group mentioned above. So they are not close relatives of Atrax, and they are not dangerous. They just have a similar way of making a funnel-shaped web that leads down to some kind of shelter where the spider hides in wait for some insect to eat. Atrax is a very large and very aggressive spider, and these other spiders are from small to medium size and are extremely timid.

[[Antivenom]]

CATEGORIES: Medicine

An antivenom is a medicine used to protect against a specific venom. (A venom is a poison released by a snake or insect.) Frequently the venom of some creature such as a cobra will be harvested and a little will be injected using a hypodermic needle into a horse every day for a long time. The horse's body will develop an immunity to the venom, so more and more venom from the snake can be injected every day. After the horse is immune, its blood can be drawn little by little to get the part of the blood that makes the horse immune. That part can then be injected into humans who have been bitten by cobras.

There are antivenoms for the very large and very dangerous funnel-web spiders found in Australia, and for the widow spiders (such as the black widow) found all around the world.

[[URL shortening]]

URL shortening is a technique on the World Wide Web in which a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) may be made substantially shorter in length and still direct to the required page. This is achieved by  using an HTTP Redirect on a domain name that is short, which links to the web page that has a long URL. For example, the URL http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL_shortening can be shortened to http://wrapr.co/GvR7j, http://evg.in/az41 or http://evg.in/urlwiki. This is especially convenient for messaging technologies such as Twitter and Identi.ca, which severely limit the number of characters that may be used in a message. Short URLs allow otherwise long web addresses to be referred to in a tweet. In November 2009, the shortened links on one URL shortening service were accessed 2.1 billion times.cn

[[Brazilian wandering spider]]

CATEGORIES: Spiders

Phoneutria is a genus of spiders which are  dangerous to human beings. Their venom is more powerful, drop for drop, than other venoms. They are called "armed spiders" in Portuguese because their venom is a powerful weapon. Their body length goes from 17 to 48 mm (0.7–1.9 in).  

These spiders live in Central America and South America. They hide in the daytime and walk around looking for food at night. So in English they are called 'wandering spiders'. There are several species, and only Phoneutria fera can kill healthy adult humans. People who get bitten by Phoneutria spiders can be given an antivenom. In any event, their degree of toxicity has been challenged. The spiders may be able to control the amount of venom they inject.

There are about eight species in this genus.

[[Page Three]]

CATEGORIES: Newspaper publishing

Many tabloid newspapers use a photo of a topless or a naked girl to improve their sales. Very often, this photo is placed on page three of the newspaper; that is where the name of this feature is from. For this reason, the feature is referred to as Page Three or Page 3. The newspaper The Sun, who introduced this in 1970, holds a copyright on the name. The Sun showed a picture of a topless girl on page three. Other newspapers, such as the Daily Star and Daily Mirror had pictures of naked women; The Mirror changed for models in swimsuits after a few years.

Claire Short tried to stop this.She did not want to penalize the depiction of nude women, but she wanted to define a newspaper as a publication that did not show naked or topless men or women. This would have meant that British rainbow press would no longer have been newspapers. She received 3,000 letters supporting the idea. The Sun, and other papers fought against the bill, which was known as Page Three Bill. Eventually, the Bill failed, because it did not get enough support.

There are many women who want to appear as a page three girl. Most of them are unemployed, or come from the working class. Buying make-up and clothes to be able to run as a contestant is very expensive; most of the women can barely afford this alone. Very often, the whole family will help. The best motivation for these women is to be able to start a career as a starlet.

Many girls who started as a page three model later became well-known. Examples are Samantha Fox, Michelle Marsh, andr Lucy Pinder.

[[Skyland, Washington, D.C.]]

CATEGORIES: Neighborhoods in Washington, D.C.

Skyland is a neighborhood in Southeast Washington, D.C. It is next to Good Hope Road to the northeast, Alabama Avenue to the southeast, and Fort Stanton Park to the south and west. It is a part of the area called Anacostia.

The District government wants to rebuild the 18 Skyland Shopping Center at Alabama Avenue and Naylor Road, SE in Ward 7 into a mixed-used town center. Local residents asked the District government for help in the 1980s, because the current buildings were falling apart and many stores were empty.  The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development decided in 2005 that the District government could not use federal money to buy Skyland because of past mistakes.

The District is working with the Rappaport Cos. and the William S. Smith Cos. on a new plan for Skyland. They want to build 320000 of retail space. They hope that the new buildings will be filled with  high-quality, national stores and locally-owned shops and restaurants. Torti Gallas & Partners are architects who are drawing the new plans. The new buildings will cost $260 million. On May 25, 2011, DC Mayor Vincent Gray told Wal-Mart officials that he would not allow them to build four other new stores in the District of Columbia unless Wal-Mart also opened a store in Skyland. However, Safeway holds the exclusive right to sell groceries in the development, which may block a Wal-Mart at Skyland.

The project will also include 420 to 470 units of housing. About 80 percent of the housing units will be owned by the people who live there and 20 percent will be rented. 

People are fighting the plan in court. The land owners do not want to sell their land to Rappaport and Smith. The District wants to force the current owners to sell (eminent domain).

Rappaport and Smith filed a Planned Unit Development (PUD) application with the Zoning Commission in 2008.  The DC Council approved a Tax Increment Financing (TIF) package to loan money for the new buildings. In July 2010, the District's zoning commission approved the plan for the new buildings. Building will start in 2012. The new buildings are expected to open in 2014.

Skyland is a part of the Good Hope neighborhood.  Hillcrest to the east and Naylor Gardens to the southeast of the Good Hope neighborhood.

Alexey Grigoryevich Stakhanov (Алексе́й Григо́рьевич Стаха́нов; 3 January 1906 – 5 November 1977) was a miner in the Soviet Union. In 1970, he was made a Hero of Socialist Labor. In 1936, he became a member of the CPSU. He became a celebrity in 1935 as part of a movement that was intended to increase worker productivity and demonstrate the superiority of the socialist economic system.

Stakhanov was born in Lugovaya near Oryol. In 1927, he began working in a mine called "Tsentralnaya-Irmino" in Kadievka (Donbass). In 1933, Stakhanov became a jackhammer operator. In 1935, he took a local course in mining. On 31 August 1935, it was reported that he had mined a record 102 tonnes of coal in 5 hours and 45 minutes (14 times his quota). On 19 September, Stakhanov was reported to have set a new record by mining 227 tonnes of coal in a single shift. His example was held up in newspapers and posters as a model for others to follow, and he even appeared on the cover of Time Magazine.

Between 1936 and 1941, Stakhanov was a student of the Industrial Academy in Moscow. In 1941–1942, he was appointed director of mine No. 31 in Karaganda. Between 1943 and 1957, Stakhanov worked in the Ministry of Coal Industry of the USSR.

Stakhanov was a deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR of the first convocation. He was awarded two Orders of Lenin, Order of the Red Banner, and numerous medals. The last Sunday of August was designated "Coal Miner's Day", also apparently in his honor.

The town of Kadievka in eastern Ukraine where he started his work was renamed Stakhanov in his honour in 1978, after his death.

Stakhanov's records set an example throughout the country and gave birth to the Stakhanovite movement where workers who exceeded production targets could become "Stakhanovites". Orwell in Animal Farm presents Boxer as a symbolic character of the "Stakhanovites"January 2011.

[[Brentwood (Washington, D.C.)]]

CATEGORIES: Neighborhoods in Washington, D.C.

Brentwood is a neighborhood in Northeast Washington, D.C.. It is named after the Brentwood Mansion built at Florida Avenue and 6th Street NE in 1817 by Robert Brent, the first mayor of Washington City. He built it as a wedding present for his daughter Eleanor and Congressman Joseph Pearson. Brent gave them both the mansion and a large farm surrounding it. Congressman Pearson also purchased additional properties and expanded the estate further. The property then known as Brentwood was larger than the present (2007) neighborhood known as Brentwood. Images of the mansion may be found in the book "Capital Losses: A Cultural History of Washington's Destroyed Buildings" by James W. Goode, and in several books in the collection of the Historical Society of Washington, D.C. Edward Sisson, a descendant of the family that owned the mansion throughout its existence, has posted a collection of paintings, drawings, photos, and histories of the mansion on-line.  The Frick Art Reference Library (http://www.frick.org/) has drawings, paintings, and perhaps photographs (although none appear to be accessible on-line as of late 2007). On the web, a small drawing of the mansion, together with a brief description of its owners in 1873, Capt. & Mrs. Carlile Pollock Patterson, may be found in "Washington Outside and Inside" by George Alfred Townsend, at page 620, searchable as a "google book."

Many people think that Benjamin Latrobe (who designed the United States Capitol) designed Brentwood Mansion. However, at the time of the house's design, Latrobe was suffering family troubles and his records for this period are poor.

During the administration of President Ulysses S. Grant (1869-1877), Brentwood Mansion was a center of Washington social life, with many parties hosted by Elizabeth (Eliza) Worthington Patterson (daughter of Joseph Pearson and his third wife Catherine Worthington Pearson) and her husband Carlile Pollock Patterson. Patterson had known Grant since 1852; Patterson's brother-in-law David Dixon Porter, married to Patterson's sister George Ann, was the highest-ranking Admiral in the US Navy; and Patterson's brother Thomas H. Patterson was commander of the Washington Navy Yard (1873-1876) before becoming the Rear Admiral in command of the Asiatic Squadron (1877-1880). Patterson Street, N.E., which is adjacent to the property, was probably named for the Patterson family.

C.P. Patterson, a Naval officer and ship captain turned scientist and administrator of a government department, had neither the interest nor the aptitude to manage the transformation of a large rural farming and forest property into an urbanized part of the city growing around it. After C.P. Patterson's death in 1881, long-delayed financial problems came to a head, and on June 6, 1884, three years after Patterson's death, Congress enacted a private bill, House bill No. 4689, entitled "An act for the relief of Eliza W. Patterson," C.P. Patterson's widow, excusing accumulated District of Columbia property taxes on the Patterson land. President Chester A. Arthur neither signed nor vetoed the bill, but held it ten days and allowed it to become law without his signature. In a message dated June 21, 1884, the President explained "I do not question the constitutional right of Congress to pass a law relieving the family of an officer, in view of the services he had rendered his country, from the burdens of taxation, but I submit to Congress that this just gift of the nation to the family of such faithful officer should come from the National Treasury rather than from that of this District, and I therefore recommend that an appropriation be made to reimburse the District for the amount of taxes which would have been due to it had this act not become a law."

After five more years confusion, in March 1889, Patterson's son-in-law, Lt. Francis Winslow (II) USN (oldest brother of future Rear Admiral Cameron Winslow), after 19 years of Naval service during the slow-promotion post-war years, resigned from the Navy to devote himself to subdividing, renting, developing, and selling portions of the property. He was successful. A portion of this property later became the subject of a lawsuit that reached the United States Supreme Court, Francis Winslow v. Baltimore & Ohio RR Co., 188 U.S. 646 (1903), which includes excerpts of the will by which Mrs. Patterson came into the property on the death of her mother, Catherine Worthington Pearson, in 1868. The suit, which the Patterson/Winslow family won, involved renewal of a lease of some of the land to a railroad. (Winslow (II) also developed an expertise in oysters, having led government surveys in the 1870s, 1880s, and 1890s. A "google" search on "Francis Winslow" and "oyster" returns dozens of "hits," referring to the Francis Winslow who managed the Brentwood property. His work is still cited today (2007) as authoritative and accurate. See: http://www.ocracokepreservation.org/id39.html https://web.archive.org/web/20120209110305/http://www.ocracokepreservation.org/id39.html. Winslow was also a leader of US government survey expeditions in Nicaragua, studying potential routes for a canal to connect the Atlantic and Pacific.).

The death of Francis Winslow (II) in 1908, suspected to have been caused by illnesses contracted in the Nicaraguan jungle, led to another period of drift in the management of the property as his four sons pursued other careers. In 1917, 100 years after it was built, the vacant Brentwood Mansion burned, and the land became the site of a World War I Army staging camp, Camp Meigs. Three of Francis Winslow (II)'s sons were officers in World War I, and they may have staged in that camp, on their own family land. In 1919 the partially burnt house was finally demolished. Part of the property became the first lumberyard for the building supply and hardware company Hechinger Co., a store that was prominent in Washington into the 1990s.

In the 1920s, Lt. Winslow's son, Francis Winslow (III), ended his career as a mining engineer and took over active management of the Brentwood Patterson/Winslow land. His most notable achievement was the development of the Union Market. For years called the Florida Avenue Market, it still operates after 80 years as the city's principal wholesale food and produce market. Photographs and a detailed history of this development may be found in an April 24, 2007, District of Columbia planning document, the Florida Avenue Market Study, at http://www.anc6a.org/FLaveMarketStudy.pdf https://web.archive.org/web/20071128212512/http://www.anc6a.org/FLaveMarketStudy.pdf.

In the early 1940s, the District of Columbia used eminent domain to acquire a large parcel of the Patterson land known as "square 710", on which is being built (2007) the new headquarters of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (200 Florida Avenue, N.E.). Illustrations of the ATF headquarters can be found at http://www.loopnet.com/xNet/MainSite/Listing/Profile/ProfileSE.aspx?LID=15025032&linkcode=10850&sourcecode=1lww2t006a00001January 2021. The seizure of square 710 led to a suit by Winslow (III) as trustee, asserting that the compensation offered by the District was inadequate. Winslow won the suit and a judgment for a larger sum, whereupon, according to the family, the District informed him that it simply didn't have the money to pay the larger judgment. Regardless of payment or nonpayment, title had vested in the government. At about this time, Winslow was demoralized by the death of his 17-year-old daughter in a 1946 car accident, and was then diagnosed with cancer. He died in 1948.

His youngest brother Cameron, an insurance executive in Hartford, CT, stepped in as trustee, but it is unclear whether either Francis or Cameron ever received payment from the government of the court-ordered price of "square 710." If not, there may be the ironic situation of a government law-enforcement agency headquarters located on land for which the government did not comply with the law by paying the lawful price. Cameron Winslow, determining that no one in the next generation appeared interested in managing the property, and unable to manage the properties day-to-day from Hartford, began selling all remaining parts of the property in the 1950s, completing the last of the sales in the 1960s, breaking-up the landed estate that Robert Brent had assembled some 200 years before.

Over the decades, much of the land was acquired by or donated to Gallaudet University, a prominent school for the deaf. Cogswell Hall, a residence hall of Gallaudet University, is said to be built on the site of the old Brentwood Mansion. According to a website on Washington ghost stories, http://members.aol.com/waniehol/DCplaces.html, students have reported that it is haunted by the spirit of a little girl. Allegedly, blankets have been yanked off, an unplugged alarm clock went off, papers have moved with no draft or breeze, there are feelings of being watched, and at least one student has been tapped awake with no one there.

Brentwood neighborhood as it is today (whose boundaries are somewhat different than the original Brent property, as increased by Pearson) is trapezoidal in its geography. It is bounded by New York Avenue to the south, Montana Avenue to the east, Rhode Island Avenue NE to the north, and the tracks of the Washington Metro's Red Line and Amtrak's Northeast Corridor to the west. It is serviced by the Rhode Island Ave-Brentwood Metro station. Politically, Brentwood is in Ward 5.

Brentwood has the main post office for Washington, D.C. It was the postal mail sorting facility through which anthrax-contaminated mail addressed to two members of the U.S. Senate passed in the 2001 anthrax attacks. The Post Office is now named after Joseph Curseen Jr. and Thomas Morris Jr., who were postal workers who died after exposure to the anthrax in the incident. The 633,000 square foot facility was closed October 21, 2001, because of anthrax contamination and did not reopen until December 21, 2003.

The area also is the site of a major rapid transit rail maintenance facility of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transportation Authority (WMATA), the principal public transit operator in metropolitan Washington, D.C.  It is served by the New York Avenue Metrorail station.

[[Swing (seat)]]

CATEGORIES: Playground equipment

A swing is a hanging seat. It is usually found in a playground for children. Acrobats in a circus can also have swings which hang from the top of the tent. Sometimes chairs in gardens are made to swing gently.

The seat of a swing is suspended from chains or ropes. The child sits on the swing and kicks off from the ground with his feet.  The swing then starts to swing to and fro.  The child can make the swing go higher by pulling (as he goes forwards) and pushing (as he goes backwards) the rope and by making his legs straight as it goes up. Once a swing is in motion it continues to oscillate like a pendulum until something brings it to a halt.

In children's playgrounds some swings are made for very young children.  They have safety bars with holes for the legs. Their parents can push them to help the swing. At the highest point on a swing, the person sitting on it is weightless.

Usually the ground is grassy, sandy, or padded with rubber so riders do not hurt themselves badly if they fall off, although this should not happen if they are being sensible. Sometimes several swings are hung from one long metal or wooden frame.

Many children have swings in their own gardens or back yards.  A tyre (or tire) can be hung by a rope from the branch of a tree to make a swing.

[[Alienation]]

CATEGORIES: Sociology, Philosophy

Alienation is the feeling of being left out, not belonging or not understanding yourself in relation to your environment. Alienation can be talked about in many ways. In psychology, researchers talk about alienation in terms of how well or unwell people fit in to their social groups. This may include how well people relate to their peers in a school or workplace, and how connected they feel to those around them.

In sociology, alienation is a more complex and difficult idea. Alienation is how people understand themselves in relation to their entire society. A good example of this is how people think of themselves when they are working and doing a job. Karl Marx wrote about this. This kind of alienation happens when people do work that they are not interested in or find boring. However, in almost all societies some people may have to do jobs that they don't like because they need to earn money. This can be seen as a type of alienation because a person's true feelings and their actions are separated and unrelated. On the other hand, a person might feel empowered and connected if they do a job that they do like. Empowerment and the feeling of being connected is the opposite of alienation.

Alienation is also a key element in the existentialism of Sartre and Camus. The connection between these ideas is the theme of Colin Wilson's The Outsider (1956). Anomie is another related idea.

[[Telomere]]

CATEGORIES: Chromosomes, Molecular biology

A telomere is a region of DNA at the end of a chromosome. It protects the end of the chromosome from deteriorating (getting worse) or fusing (joining) with other chromosomes.

The telomeres are made of repeated sequences of DNA ('repetitive DNA'). During cell division, enzymes that duplicate DNA cannot continue their work all the way to the end of chromosomes. If cells divided without telomeres, they would lose the ends of their chromosomes, and the information they contain. 

The telomeres are disposable buffers blocking the ends of the chromosomes. They are destroyed during cell division, and are remade by an enzyme, telomerase reverse transcriptase.

The Australian Elizabeth Blackburn and the Americans Carol Greider and Jack Szostak won the 2008 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their work on telomeres.

[[Molecular orbital]]

CATEGORIES: Physics, Quantum chemistry, Theoretical chemistry, Computational chemistry, Chemical bonding

In chemistry, a molecular orbital (or MO) explains what happens to electrons when atoms join together in a molecule.  A MO is a mathematical function which describes the wave-like behaviour of an electron in a molecule. The functions can tell the probability of finding an electron in any specific region. Chemists use such functions to predict or explain chemical and physical properties.

Chemists usually build mathematical models of molecular orbitals by combining atomic orbitals. Hybrid orbitals from each atom of the molecule, or other molecular orbitals from groups of atoms can also be used. Computers can work on these functions. Molecular orbitals allow chemists to apply quantum mechanics to study molecules.  MOs answer questions about how the atoms in molecules stick together. The various rounded shapes in an orbital diagram indicate where electrons would most likely be found in an atom. 

[[Woodward–Hoffmann rules]]

CATEGORIES: Organic chemistry, Theoretical chemistry

The Woodward–Hoffmann rules are a set of organic chemistry rules to predict the stereochemistry of pericyclic reactions. Pericyclic reactions are usually rearrangement reactions where the molecule is a ring (e.g. benzene ring).  They were written by Robert Burns Woodward (a chemistry professor at Harvard University) and Roald Hoffmann (a chemistry professor at Cornell University). Hoffmann was awarded the 1981 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for this work, shared with Kenichi Fukui who developed a similar model. Woodward did not share the prize because he died two years before. Generally, the Nobel Prize is awarded only to living people. Woodward had already won a Nobel Prize in Chemistry for a different discovery.

A recent paper in the journal Nature describes how mechanical stress can be used to reshape chemical reaction pathways to lead to products that apparently violate Woodward–Hoffman rules.

[[Stereochemistry]]

CATEGORIES: Stereochemistry

Stereochemistry is the study of how molecules are affected by the way their atoms are arranged in space. It is also known as 3D chemistry as the word stereo means three dimensional. Using stereochemistry, chemists can work out the relationships between different molecules that are made up from the same atoms. They can also study the effect on the physical or biological properties these relationships give molecules. When these relationships influence the reactivity of the molecules it is called dynamic stereochemistry. 

In chemistry, some molecules have more than one isomer. This means that molecules can have different forms, even though all the forms made up of the same atoms. There are two kinds of isonomers. Constitutional isomers have the same atoms, but they are joined differently. Stereoisomers have the same atoms, they are joined the same way, but the atoms are arranged differently in space. An important part of stereochemistry is the study of chiral molecules. These molecules look almost identical, except that one molecule is the mirror image of the other.

In most chemical bonds, the atoms of a molecule free to move around without breaking the bonds. When a molecule has a double bond or a ring structure, the molecule can be sorted into different isomers. These are molecules with the same chemical structure but different forms.

The study of stereochemical problems covers the entire range of organic, inorganic, biological, physical and supramolecular chemistries.

CATEGORIES: 1990s automobiles, 2000s automobiles, 2010s automobiles, 2020s automobiles, Toyota automobiles

The Toyota Prius is a hybrid automobile from the Japanese automobile producer Toyota. It is called 'hybrid' because it has two different engines: a gasoline engine (combustion engine) and an electric motor. Because of the electric motor, it uses less fuel than a normal gasoline automobile when driving at low speeds (for example in the city). The electric motor uses batteries for its power, and these batteries are charged by a dynamo when the gasoline engine is used at higher speeds. The first generation launched in Japan in December 1997, then it reached the rest of the world in 2000. It entered its second generation in 2003 and it began to become more popular with buyers. The third generation arrived in 2009 and grew larger in size. The current fourth generation appeared in December 2015. 

[[Upper Palaeolithic]]

CATEGORIES: Stone Age

The Upper Palaeolithic (Upper Paleolithic or Late Stone Age) is the third and last part of the Palaeolithic period. It lasted from about 40,000 to 10,000 years ago. Humans used tools for hunting and fishing. They also developed cave paintings. In this period, the Neanderthal man completely disappeared, leaving Homo sapiens as the only surviving species in the human genus.

In Europe, Asia and Africa, this time is known as the last part of the Old Stone Age.

The first modern humans  found in Western Europe date back to about 36,000 years ago. Those fossils were found in the south-west of Romania. The founds were made in a stone cave called Peștera cu Oase.

The Lascaux cave paintings are from this time period. They are part of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites since 1979 and are in France.

Evidence for belief in the afterlife in the Upper Palaeolithic: appearance of burial rituals and ancestor worship.

Lucian Michael Freud (December 8, 1922 — July 20, 2011) was a Anglo-German painter. He is regarded as having been one of the greatest painters of the human form. He was born in Berlin in 1922, and moved with his family to England in 1933 to escape from the Nazis. He became a British citizen in 1939. His father, an architect, was the son of Sigmund Freud. During World War II, Freud studied art as well as working as a sailor in the British Merchant Navy. His brother was Clement Freud (1924-2009).

He painted portraits which have been described as being brutally honest; he did not try to make people look good. He often painted them nude, with the faces staring straight ahead. He used thick layers of paint, impasto, using colours of green, grey and purple, which he blended to with pink to suggest skin color. He was popular for a while in the 1960's, but his work was rediscovered in 1987 after an exhibition in the US. In 2008 his painting “Benefits Supervisor Sleeping” was sold for US$33.6 million — the most ever paid for a painting by a living artist. This painting was of a fat nude woman asleep on a couch.

He was made a member of the Order of Merit in 1993. This honour, given by the Queen, is limited to only 24 people who have achieved distinction in the arts, science or other areas.

He died in London after a short illness.

[[Wallace Line]]

CATEGORIES: Ecology, Physical geography

The Wallace Line (or 'Wallace's Line') is a boundary that separates the ecozone of Asia and the Australasian ecozone. The transitional zone is sometimes called Wallacea.

Plants and animals related to Asian species are found to the north-west. Australasian species are found mainly to the south-east, with some Asian species. The line is named after Alfred Russel Wallace, who noticed this clear dividing line during his travels through the East Indies in the 19th century. 

The line runs through Indonesia, between Borneo and Sulawesi (Celebes); and through the Lombok Strait between Bali (in the west) and Lombok (in the east).  

The distance between Bali and Lombok is only about 35 kilometers. Surprisingly, the distributions of many bird species observe the line, because many birds do not cross even the smallest stretches of open ocean water. Some bats have distributions that cross the Wallace Line, but other mammals are generally limited to one side or the other; an exception is the Crab-eating Macaque. Other groups of plants and animals show differing patterns, but the overall pattern is striking and reasonably consistent.

The term 'Wallace's Line' was first used by Huxley in 1868.

[[Molecular symmetry]]

CATEGORIES: Symmetry, Theoretical chemistry

Molecular symmetry is a basic idea in chemistry. It is about the symmetry of molecules. It puts molecules into groups according to their symmetry. It can predict or explain many of a molecule's chemical properties.

Chemists study symmetry to explain how crystals are made up and how chemicals react. The molecular symmetry of the reactants help predict how the product of the reaction is made up and the energy needed for the reaction.

Molecular symmetry can be studied several different ways. Group theory is the most popular idea. Group theory is also useful in studying the symmetry of molecular orbitals. This is used in the Hückel method, ligand field theory, and the Woodward–Hoffmann rules. Another idea on a larger scale is the use of crystal systems to describe crystallographic symmetry in bulk materials.

Scientists find molecular symmetry by using X-ray crystallography and other forms of spectroscopy. Spectroscopic notation is based on facts taken from molecular symmetry.

Jean Paul Getty (December 15, 1892 – June 6, 1976) was an American industrialist. He founded the Getty Oil Company. In 1957 Fortune magazine named him the richest living American, and the 1966 Guinness Book of Records named him as the world's richest private citizen, worth an estimated $1,200 million.  At his death, he was worth more than $2 billion. A book published in 1996 ranked him as the 67th richest American who ever lived. (The book ranked his wealth as a percentage of the United States gross national product.) Despite his wealth, Getty was known for being a miser.

Getty enjoyed collecting art and antiquities. His collection formed the basis of the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles, California, and over $661 million of his estate was left to the museum after his death.  He established the J. Paul Getty Trust in 1953.  The trust is the world's wealthiest art institution. It operates the J. Paul Getty Museum, the Getty Foundation, the Getty Research Institute, and the Getty Conservation Institute.

[[Electrocyclic reaction]]

CATEGORIES: Chemistry

In organic chemistry, an electrocyclic reaction is a type of pericyclic rearrangement reaction. The reaction is electrocyclic if the result is one pi bond becoming one sigma bond or one sigma bond becoming a pi bond.  Electrocyclic reactions share the following properties:

The torquoselectivity in an electrocyclic reaction refers to the direction that the substituents rotate. For example, the substituents in a reaction that is conrotatory can still rotate in two directions. It produces a mixture of two products that are the mirror image of each other (enantiomeric products). A reaction that is torquoselective restricts one of these directions of rotation (partially or completely) to produce a product in enantiomeric excess (where one stereoisomer is produced much more than the other).

Chemists are interested in electrocyclic reactions because the geometry of the molecules confirm a number of predictions made by theoretical chemists. They confirm the conservation of molecular orbital symmetry.

The Nazarov cyclization reaction is an electrocyclic reaction that closes a ring. It converts divinylketones to cyclopentenones. (It was discovered by Ivan Nikolaevich Nazarov (1906–1957).)

An example is the thermal ring-opening reaction of 3,4-dimethylcyclobutene. The cis isomer only yields cis,trans-2,4-hexadiene. But the trans isomer gives the trans,trans diene:

The frontier-orbital method explains how this reaction works. The sigma bond in the reactant will open in a way that the resulting p-orbitals will have the same symmetry as the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the product (a butadiene). This can only happen with a conrotatory ring-opening that results in opposite signs for the two lobes at the broken ends of the ring. (A disrotatory ring-opening would form an anti-bond.) The following diagram shows this:

The stereospecificity of the result depends on whether the reaction proceeds through a conrotatory or disrotatory process.

[[Arctic hare]]

CATEGORIES: Mammals of North America, Lagomorphs

The Arctic hare (Lepus arcticus) is a social animal that lives in the frigid tundra of North America, Newfoundland, and Greenland. These hares often congregate in groups of up to 200 individuals. They hop at great speeds on their large, powerful hind legs, in a kangaroo-like fashion. The female is called a doe, the male is called a buck, and the baby hare is called a leveret. The young are born open-eyed and furry. Most hares live for about a year in the wild. 

This mammal is hunted by arctic foxes, arctic wolves, polar bears, falcons, snowy owls, golden eagles and ermine. They are unharmed during winter and are used to wintry weather.

[[Crypsis]]

CATEGORIES: Ecology

Crypsis is a word in ecology which means "hiding". It refers to the ways animals avoid being seen, or otherwise detected. It also includes the situation when an animal is noticed, but is not recognised for what it is. It may be either a defence against predators, or a device for predators to get near prey.

Methods include camouflage, nocturnality (night-time activity), subterranean lifestyle, transparency, and mimicry. The word can also be used about eggs, and about pheromone production.  Crypsis can in principle involve visual, olfactory or auditory camouflage.

The 2011 Norway attacks were two attacks in Norway on 22 July 2011. The first attack was a car bombing near government buildings in Oslo. The second attack was a mass shooting at a summer youth camp on an island northwest of Oslo. Of the total 77 deaths, 55 were teenagers, and another 96 people were injured. The car bomb also shattered many windows of buildings in the government quarter of downtown Oslo.

The bomb explosion was near the office of Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg at 15:26. It killed eight people and injured several others. The second attack happened about 90 minutes later, at a youth camp organized by the youth group (AUF) of the Norwegian Labour Party (AP) at the island of Utøya in Tyrifjorden, Buskerud. A gunman disguised as a policeman opened fire at the campers, killing 69 people.

The police arrested several suspects, but most were released. Anders Behring Breivik, a 32-year-old Norwegian Protestant man, committed both attacks. He was later charged with both attacks. Records show he had planned the attacks for years, as an act of anti-immigration ideology and against multiculturalism.

The European Union, NATO and countries around the world have expressed their support for Norway and condemned the attacks.

[[Gas exchange]]

CATEGORIES: Physiology

Exchange of gases or gas exchange is carried out by organisms, where different gases move in different directions. Animals, microorganisms and plants breathe out carbon dioxide and breathe in oxygen. To balance the composition of air, plants use carbon dioxide to carry out photosynthesis, so oxygen is made. Plants only carry this out during the day, when there is sunlight. Plants respire all day and night.

In the human respiratory system, gas exchange happens in the alveolus (alveoli for plural). These are in the lungs and help with diffusion. Oxygen diffuses into the bloodstream, from the air. Oxygen is used in aerobic respiration. Carbon dioxide diffuses out of the bloodstream, into the air. Carbon dioxide is a waste product made by respiration.

Amyl alcohols are used as stabilizers in the production of Chloroform and Dichloromethane to stop phosgene from being made.

[[Paul Strzelecki]]

CATEGORIES: 1797 births, 1873 deaths, Explorers, Exploration of Australia, Polish people

Paul Edmund de Strzelecki (20 July 1797 — October 1873) was a Polish man who taught himself geology. He became famous for his explorations in Australia.

He was born in Gluszyna, near Poznan, Western Poland in 1797 and later served briefly with the Prussian army. He tried unsuccessfully to marry a young girl, and then was accused of stealing money from his employer. He moved to London and gave himself the title of Count Strzelecki. In 1834 he went to North America and spent time visiting mineral areas and exploring for minerals. He is said to be the first person to find copper in Canada. In 1836 he travelled along the west coast from Chile to California.

In 1839 he visited the Hawaii, Tahiti, New Zealand and finally landed in Sydney, Australia. He wanted to make a geological map, and explored large parts of New South Wales and Victoria, including the Australian Alps. He climbed Australia's highest mountain, and named it Mount Kosciuszko, after the Polish leader, Tadeusz Kosciuszko.

He spent several years in Tasmania before going back to Sydney. He went back to London in 1843. He wrote a book on his discoveries in Australia called Physical Description of New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land. He was given the Founder's Medal by the Royal Geographical Society.

In 1847—8 he was put in charge of the giving out money in Ireland during the Great Famine for the British Relief Association. He established standards for giving out assistance that are still being used.

He was made a Fellow of the Royal Geographic Society and the Royal Society. He was awarded the K.C.M.G. in 1869. He died from cancer in 1873. He left instructions that after his death his papers were to be burnt and his body buried in an unmarked grave.

A road from Lyndhurst to Innamincka was named the Strzelecki Track after Paul Strzelecki. It was used until the 1930's to move cattle to Adelaide, and now is the main road to Moomba, a huge natural gas field which supplies Adelaide and Sydney. The Strzelecki Ranges in Victoria are also named after him. A large national park on Flinders Island, the Strzelecki National Park, was named after Strzelecki who climbed the mountains there in 1842.

[[Stress (mechanics)]]

CATEGORIES: Materials science, Elasticity (physics), Mechanics, Engineering

Stress is the force per unit area on a body that tends to cause it to change shape.

Stress is a measure of the internal forces in a body between its particles. These internal forces are a reaction to the external forces applied on the body that cause it to separate, compress or slide. External forces are either surface forces or body forces. Stress is the average force per unit area that a particle of a body exerts on an adjacent particle, across an imaginary surface that separates them.

The formula for uniaxial normal stress is:

where σ is the stress, F is the force and A is the surface area.

In SI units, force is measured in newtons and area in square metres. This means stress is newtons per square meter, or N/m2. However, stress has its own SI unit, called the pascal. 1 pascal (symbol Pa) is equal to 1 N/m2. In Imperial units, stress is measured in pound-force per square inch, which is often shortened to "psi". The dimension of stress is the same as that of pressure.

In continuum mechanics, the loaded deformable body behaves as a continuum. So, these internal forces are distributed continually within the volume of the material body. (This means that the stress distribution in the body is expressed as a piecewise continuous function of space and time.) The forces cause deformation of the body's shape. The deformation can lead to a permanent shape change or structural failure if the material is not strong enough.

Some models of continuum mechanics treat force as something that can change. Other models look at the deformation of matter and solid bodies, because the characteristics of matter and solids are three dimensional. Each approach can give different results. Classical models of continuum mechanics assume an average force and do not properly include  "geometrical factors". (The geometry of the body can be important to how stress is shared out and how energy builds up during the application of the external force.)

[[Pericyclic reaction]]

CATEGORIES: Pericyclic reactions, Rearrangement reactions

In organic chemistry, a pericyclic reaction is a type of chemical reaction between organic compounds. In the case of pericyclic reactions, the transition state of the molecule is a ring (has a cyclic geometry), and the reaction goes forward in a concerted way. Pericyclic reactions are usually rearrangement reactions. The most important groups of pericyclic reactions are:

In general, pericyclic reactions are equilibrium processes. However, it is possible to push the reaction in one direction if the product is at a significantly lower energy level. This is applying Le Chatelier's principle to a reaction involving a single molecule.

Many pericyclic reactions have similar stepwise radical processes connected with them. Chemists disagree whether some reactions are pericyclic reactions. For example, it is not definitively known whether the 2+2 cycloaddition mechanism is concerted (or may depend on the reactive system). Many pericyclic reactions have similar reactions that are metal-catalyzed. But these metal-catalyzed reactions are also not really pericyclic. The metal catalysts stabilize the reaction intermediates. So the reaction is not concerted, but rather metal-stabilized.

A large photoinduced hydrogen sigmatropic shift was utilized in a corrin synthesis performed by Albert Eschenmoser containing a 16π system.  

Due to the principle of microscopic reversibility, there is a parallel set of "retro" pericyclic reactions, which perform the reverse reaction.

[[Cycloaddition]]

CATEGORIES: Chemical reactions

A cycloaddition is a chemical reaction between reactants with double bonds that get replaced by a ring structure.  It is a pericyclic chemical reaction where "two or more unsaturated molecules (or parts of the same molecule) combine with the formation of a cyclic adduct in which there is a net reduction of the bond multiplicity." It is a cyclization reaction: it makes new ring of atoms.

Cycloadditions are named by the basic size of the molecules that are being brought together. This would make the Diels–Alder reaction a + 2cycloaddition, and the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition a + 2cycloaddition. This type of reaction is a non-polar addition reaction.

[[Cheletropic reaction]]

CATEGORIES: Pericyclic reactions

A cheletropic reaction is a type of pericyclic reaction where one atom on one of the reagents gets two new bonds. A pericyclic reaction is one that involves a transition state with a cyclic array of atoms and an associated cyclic array of interacting orbitals. A reorganization of σ and π bonds occurs in this cyclic array.

Cheletropic reactions are a subclass of cycloadditions. What sets cheletropic reactions apart is that on one of the reagents, both new bonds are being made to the same atom.  A few examples are shown to the right in Figure 1. In the first case, the single atom is the carbon atom in the carbonyl group. That carbon atom ends up in carbon monoxide. The end result is making two new bonds to one atom. The first two examples are known as "cheletropic extrusions" because a small stable molecule is given off in the reaction. The driving force for these reactions is often the entropic benefit of releasing a gas (e.g. CO or N2).

[[Sigmatropic reaction]]

CATEGORIES: Rearrangement reactions

A sigmatropic reaction in organic chemistry is a pericyclic reaction. A sigmatropic reaction does not use a catalyst and involves a single molecule (an uncatalyzed intramolecular process). It changes one σ-bond into a different σ-bond. The name sigmatropic is the result of a compounding of the long-established "sigma" name for single carbon-carbon bonds and the Greek word tropos, meaning turn.  This is a rearrangement reaction which means that the bonds in a molecule shift between atoms without any atoms leaving or new atoms added to the molecule. In a sigmatropic reaction, a substituent moves from one part of a π-bonded system to another part in an intramolecular reaction with simultaneous rearrangement of the π system. True sigmatropic reactions usually do not need a catalyst. Some sigmatropic reactions are catalyzed by a Lewis acid.  Sigmatropic reactions often have transition-metal catalysts that form intermediates in analogous reactions.  The most well-known of the sigmatropic rearrangements are the 3,3 Cope rearrangement, Claisen rearrangement, Carroll rearrangement and the Fischer indole synthesis.

Grand Army Plaza is at 59th Street and Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, New York.  It is in front of the Plaza Hotel. It is opposite the southeast corner of Central Park. The sculptor Karl Bitter first had the idea for the Plaza in 1898. It is named after the Grand Army of the Potomac. The Carrère and Hastings architecture firm designed it. Construction was finished in 1916. 

The Plaza is oval. 59th street divides it into northern and southern parts. The northern part has a golden statue of William Tecumseh Sherman designed by Augustus Saint-Gaudens. The statue features Sherman on a horse with the goddess "Victory" in front of him. There are often temporary sculpture exhibits at the north side of the plaza.

The southern part is the Plaza of the Pulitzer Fountain of Abundance. This fountain was designed by Bitter and paid for by Joseph Pulitzer. A bronze statue of the Roman goddess Pomona is at the top of the fountain. The statue of Pomona was the last one that Bitter designed. 

The plaza was renovated in 1990 at a cost of $3.7 million.  The  Plaza Hotel is named for the Plaza, and is at its southwest corner.

USS ''Enterprise'' (CV-6), often called the "Big E," was the sixth aircraft carrier of the United States Navy. She was also the seventh U.S. Navy ship to use the name. She was launched in 1936 and was a Yorktown class aircraft carrier. She was one of three American carriers brought into service before World War II which survived the war. She took part in more fights against Japan than any other U.S. ship. These fights included the Battle of Midway, the Battle of the Eastern Solomons, the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands, many other fights during the Guadalcanal campaign, the Battle of the Philippine Sea, and the Battle of Leyte Gulf. At three different times during the Pacific War, the Japanese said that she had been sunk in battle. This lead her to be nicknamed "The Grey Ghost".

Enterprise earned 20 battle stars. This was more than any other U.S. warship in World War II. Some have said that she is the most glorious and honored ship in the history of the United States Navy. However, the 18th century frigate USS Constitution could perhaps rival that.

Arlington National Cemetery is a cemetery in Arlington County, Virginia. People who served in the United States military are buried here. The cemetery started during the American Civil War. It is on a big farm called Arlington House. Arlington House was the home of Mary Anna Custis Lee. Mary Anna Custis Lee was a great-granddaughter of Martha Washington. She was also the wife of Confederate general Robert E. Lee. Although most of the farm now has graves, the old farmhouse still stands in the middle of the cemetery. The cemetery is across the Potomac River from the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C..

The cemetery covers 624. People who died serving the United States in a war, and military veterans are allowed to be buried in the cemetery. People are buried here who fought in wars from American Civil War to the military actions in Afghanistan and Iraq. People who were buried here before the Civil War were reburied after 1900.

Arlington National Cemetery is taken care of by the United States Army. Arlington House (Custis-Lee Mansion) and its land are taken care of by the National Park Service as a memorial to Lee. Recently, the way the cemetery is managed caused controversy.

[[Torquoselectivity]]

CATEGORIES: Stereochemistry

In organic chemistry, torquoselectivity describes electrocyclic reactions that produce one isomer more than the other. An official definition is "the preference for inward or outward rotation of substituents in conrotatory

or disrotatory electrocyclic reactions." In other words, a chemical reaction is torquoselective if the groups of atoms that hang from a ring of atoms are more likely to have rotated in a particular direction during the reaction (instead of being equally likely to rotate in both possible directions.) Torquoselectivity is different from the normal diastereoselectivity of pericyclic reactions. Instead it is more selectivity beyond the Woodward–Hoffmann rules. The name comes from the idea that the substituents in an electrocyclization appear to rotate during the reaction. The reaction produces a single product because only one direction of rotation was allowed (that is, the direction of rotation on the substituents was favored). The concept was originally developed by Kendall N. Houk.

When a chemical reaction closes a ring, its torquoselectivity is the same as enantioselectivity. A single enantiomer of a cyclization product is formed from the selective ring closure of the starting material. In a typical electrocyclic ring closing, selection for either conrotatory or disrotatory reactions modes still produces two enantiomers. Torquoselectivity is a discrimination between these possible enantiomers that requires asymmetric induction.

Torquoselectivity also happens in selective electrocyclic reactions that break open rings. The different directions of rotation produce distinct structural isomers. In these cases, steric strain is often the driving force for the selectivity. Studies have shown that the selectivity can also be changed by the presence of electron donating and electron withdrawing groups.

Torquoselectivity can also apply to other mechanisms, including chiral Lewis acid catalysts, induction by neighboring stereocenters (in which case the torquoselectivity is a case of diastereoselectivity), and axial-to-tetrahedral chirality transfer. An example of axial-to-tetrahedral chirality transfer is shown below for the torquoselective Nazarov cyclization reaction of a chiral allenyl vinyl ketone.

[[Booster seat]]

CATEGORIES: Children, Safety

A booster seat is a seat cushion that is used to elevate children in cars. Children have to use booster seats so that the seat belt fits better. 

In general most booster seats can be used for children who are between four and twelve years of age and between 40 and 59 inches (100–150 cm) tall. Children under 40 inches are usually too small to use booster seats and have to use a car seat (a child safety seat with an own seat belt system, used for children under the age of 4-6).

Many countries have laws that require the use of booster seats. In the United States of America children  under 57 inches (145 cm) and younger than 9 years old have to use a booster seat. Many European countries require a booster seat until the child is either twelve years old or 59 inches tall. There are some exceptions. In the United Kingdom for example children are allowed to ride without a booster seat when they are 53 inches tall and in Austria children who are not 59 inches tall have to use a booster seat until their 14th birthday. However booster seats are used to keep children safe, not because of a law. In general no child can ride safely in a car without booster seat when he is not 57 inches tall. It is proved that children under 57 inches who do not use a booster seat are more likely to suffer serious injuries or even death in the event of an accident. February 2012

[[Arthur Rubinstein]]

CATEGORIES: 1887 births, 1982 deaths, American pianists, Jewish American musicians, Polish pianists, People from Łódź

Arthur Rubinstein (January 28, 1887 – December 20, 1982) was a Polish-American pianist. He got praise from around the world for his playing of the music of a selection of composers (many call him the greatest Chopin player of the century).

Rubinstein was born in Łódź, Poland to a family of Jews. He was the youngest child of the family. His father was a rich owner of a factory.

Although his given name is Artur Rubinstein, in English-speaking countries he wanted to be known as Arthur Rubinstein. However, his United States impresario Sol Hurok wanted him to still be billed as Artur, and his recordings were released in the West under both names.

Rubinstein learned the piano at the age of two in Warsaw, before beginning study in Berlin at the age of eight. His debut in Berlin was made in 1898 followed by a debut at Carnegie Hall in the United States in 1906.

Throughout his life, Rubinstein was famous as a solo pianist, a soloist in piano concertos, and even as a chamber musician. He retired from the stage at age eighty-nine, and died in Geneva, Switzerland, on 20 December 1982, at the age of ninety-five, and his body was cremated. On the first anniversary of his death, his ashes were buried in Jerusalem – as specified in his will – in a plot now nicknamed the "Rubinstein Forest" overlooking the Jerusalem Forest.

[[U.S. Defense Department firefighters]]

CATEGORIES: United States Department of Defense, Firefighting

The United States Department of Defense employs civilian firefighters. They are stationed at military bases to work as firefighters. These workers have their own uniforms and equipment. They are not a part of any military unit. They will work alongside military units if needed. Many times, they are the only firefighters at a military facility. The civilian firefighters wear special uniforms, usually a dark blue suit with a badge and with a shoulder patch indicating their firefighting organization.

Firefighters go to special classes to learn firefighting skills. They earn certificates after taking the classes. One major class is called "DoD Fire & Emergency Services Training." 

[[Bongo (antelope)]]

CATEGORIES: Bovines, Mammals of Africa

The bongo (Tragelaphus eurycerus) is a nocturnal antelope. It has two subspecies: the western or lowland bongo, and the eastern or mountain bongo. The western bongo is near threatened and the mountain bongo is critically endangered. Bongos eat plants. They live in forests in Africa. Kenya is the only place eastern bongos live in the wild. Like the west African giraffe, the eastern or mountain bongo is one of the most threatened animals in Africa. Bongos live in both captivity and the wild.

As bongos grow their horns appear. Both male and female bongos have horns. 

[[Dyotropic reaction]]

CATEGORIES: Organic reactions

A dyotropic reaction is a type of chemical reaction. It is when an organic compound changes its structure. Two substituents jump from one place on the molecule to another. It is a pericyclic valence isomerization when two sigma bonds move at the same time to a new place on the same molecule. Dyotropic reactions are important in organic chemistry. They can explain how certain reactions work. Dyotropic reactions can be a useful step in making large and complicated molecules. Dyotropic reactions were first described by Manfred T. Reetz in 1971. The name "dyotropic reaction" comes from the Greek word dyo meaning "two." "Rearrangement" means that the reaction changes the bonds between atoms on a single molecule.

In a type I reaction, two migrating groups trade their relative positions. A type II reaction   involves migration to new bonding sites without positional interchange.

[[Diels–Alder reaction]]

CATEGORIES: Organic reactions

The Diels–Alder reaction (DA) is a chemical reaction between organic compounds. The reaction causes the compounds to form a new six-sided compound. This is called a cyclohexene. A conjugated diene joins with an alkene to make the cyclohexene. This compound looks like a ring.

This reaction was discovered by Otto Diels and Kurt Alder in 1928. In 1950, they were given the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their work on this reaction. The DA reaction is very useful as it means cyclohexenes can be made with very little energy. Cyclohexenes are used to make complex organic molecules. One of the first uses of the DA reaction was to make insecticides.

The DA reaction makes a new hexagonal ring-shaped compound. A compound with two double bonds which are one carbon atom apart from each other is joined to another compound with at least one double bond. A DA reaction can also happen if some of the atoms in the newly formed ring are not carbon. Some of the DA reactions are reversible. The reaction caused during this breaking up of the cyclic system is called the retro-Diels–Alder. These retro-Diels–Alder compounds are often seen when they are analyzed by mass spectrometry.

Some chemists call the Diels–Alder reaction the 'Mona Lisa' of organic reactions. Like the simple smile on the painting, the reaction may be far more complex than chemists have so far discovered.

Lewis acids (AlCl3, ZnCl2, and others) act as catalysts to the reaction.

CATEGORIES: Caucasus, Republics of Russia, Federal subjects of Russia

Dagestan is a federal subject of the Russian Federation in the Caucasus region. The name comes from two Persian words, dag which means mountain, and stan which means land. Dagestan has a population of nearly 3 million, and its people are known as Dagestani. Its capital city is Makhachkala.

[[Theoretical chemistry]]

CATEGORIES: Theoretical chemistry, Chemistry

Theoretical chemistry tries to explain data from chemistry experiments. It uses mathematics and computers. Theoretical chemistry predicts what happens when atoms combine to form molecules. It also predicts chemical properties (characteristics) of molecules. An important part of theoretical chemistry is quantum chemistry. This is using quantum mechanics to understand valency (the number of bonds formed by an atom of an element).  Other important parts include molecular dynamics, statistical thermodynamics and theories of electrolyte solutions, reaction networks, polymerization and catalysis.

[[Pebble]]

CATEGORIES: Sedimentary rocks

A pebble is a piece of rock with a particle size of 4 to 64 millimetres. They are often made of flint.

Pebbles are larger than granules (2 to 4 millimetres diameter) and smaller than cobbles (64 to 256 millimetres diameter). A rock made predominantly of pebbles is termed a conglomerate. Pebble tools are among the earliest known man-made artifacts, dating from the Palaeolithic period of human history.

A beach composed chiefly of surface pebbles is commonly termed a shingle beach. This type of beach resists wave erosion, and has ecological niches which can provide habitat for animals and plants.

[[MESSENGER]]

CATEGORIES: NASA spacecraft

MESSENGER, MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry and Ranging, was an unmanned NASA and APL spacecraft. It was orbiting and studying the planet Mercury.  Its mission lasted 10 years, 8 months and 28 days.

It was launched on August 3, 2004 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. It was aboard a Boeing Delta II rocket. After launch, the probe did several fly-bys and deep space manoeuvres to gain the right trajectory and speed. 

It completed 30% mapping of Mercury on January 14, 2008. MESSENGER made one more pass by Mercury in 2009, and on March 18, 2011 began to orbit Mercury. 100% mapping was completed in March 2013 and the probe continued its studies. On April 30, 2015, it crashed into Mercury. It crashed near the crater Janáček. 

[[Compensation (psychology)]]

CATEGORIES: Psychology

In psychology, compensation is a way people hide something that they cannot do well, by doing something else really well. They may not even be aware that they are doing it. Compensation can hide real or imagined problems and personal or physical inferiority. However it does not really solve the cause of the problem. Positive compensations may help a person overcome difficulties. But negative compensations do not, and can even make the problems worse.

There are two kinds of negative compensation:

A well-known example of failing overcompensation, can be seen in people going through a mid life crisis. Approaching midlife many people (especially men) lack the energy to maintain their psychological defenses, including their compensatory acts.

[[Shingle beach]]

CATEGORIES: Beaches, Geography of England

A shingle beach (or pebble beach) is a beach made of pebbles, not sand. The stones may be from 2 diameter. These beaches strongly resist erosion by waves.

This beach landform is quite common in Western Europe, because the pebbles come from the lines of flint in the chalk. Chesil Bank is an example. When the chalk erodes, the tough flint stays as pebbles.

Other examples are found in Bahrain, North America and in a number of other places. On the east coast of New Zealand's South Island, there are mixed shingle and sand fans in the braided rivers. 

[[Puddingstone]]

CATEGORIES: Sedimentary rocks

Puddingstone is a kind of sedimentary rock. It is formed when pebbles, perhaps from a shingle beach, are cemented together by silica coming out of solution.

The rock which forms is extremely hard and resistant to wear. It is used for grindstones and building. The pebbles are usually made of flint, and both they and the matrix are made of silica.

[[Injective function]]

CATEGORIES: Functions and mappings, Algebra

In mathematics, a injective function is a function f : A → B with the following property. For every element b in the codomain B, there is at most one element a in the domain A such that f(a)=b, or equivalently, distinct elements in the domain map to distinct elements in the codomain.

The term injection and the related terms surjection and bijection were introduced by Nicholas Bourbaki. In the 1930s, he and a group of other mathematicians published a series of books on modern advanced mathematics.

An injective function is often called a 1-1 (read "one-to-one") function. However, this is to be distinguish from a 1-1 correspondence, which is a bijective function (both injective and surjective).

[[Surjective function]]

CATEGORIES: Functions and mappings, Algebra

In mathematics, a surjective or onto function is a  function f : A → B with the following property. For every element b in the codomain B, there is at least one element a in the domain A such that f(a)=b. This means that no element in the codomain is unmapped, and that the range and codomain of f are the same set.

The term surjection and the related terms injection and bijection were introduced by the group of mathematicians that called itself Nicholas Bourbaki. In the 1930s, this group of mathematicians published a series of books on modern advanced mathematics. The French prefix sur means above or onto and was chosen since a surjective function maps its domain on to its codomain.

[[Shikasta (novel)]]

CATEGORIES: Science fiction books, 1979 books

Shikasta is a 1979 science fiction novel. The full title is Re: Colonised Planet 5, Shikasta. British Nobel Prize in Literature-winner Doris Lessing wrote it as the first book in her five-book Canopus in Argos series. Alfred A. Knopf published it first in the United States in October 1979. Jonathan Cape published the book in the United Kingdom in November 1979. Shikasta is also the name of the fictional planet featured in the novel.

The book has a subtitle, "Personal, psychological, historical documents relating to visit by Johor (George Sherban) Emissary (Grade 9) 87th of the Period of the Last Days". 'The novel is the history of the planet Shikasta under the influence of three galactic empires: Canopus, Sirius, and their shared enemy, Puttiora. The book is a series of reports by Canopean visitors to Shikasta. They record what happens on the planet which is very similar to Earth. The novel shows the Earth's prehistory, how things became worse, the "Century of Destruction" (the 20th-century), and the Apocalypse (World War III).

Shikasta uses stories and images from the Old Testament and is influenced by spiritual and mystical themes in Sufism. Lessing had become interested in this Islamic belief system in the mid-1960s. The book was a major shift of focus in Lessing's writing, from realism to science fiction. Many of her readers were unhappy with the change. Critics gave the book both good and bad reviews. Some were impressed by the way the book showed a wide view of humanity and the universe. One reviewer called it a brave "and disturbing work from one of the world's great living writers". Others reviewers disliked the novel because it was depressing and humanity had no free will. People's lives were controlled by galactic empires.

The story of Shikasta is retold in the third book of the Canopus series, The Sirian Experiments (1980). In that book, the story is told from the point of view of Sirius. Shikasta appears again in the fourth book in the series, The Making of the Representative for Planet 8 (1982). The Zones that are briefly mentioned in Shikasta are the subject of the second book in the series, The Marriages Between Zones Three, Four and Five (1980).

[[HOMO/LUMO]]

CATEGORIES: Physical chemistry

HOMO stands for highest occupied molecular orbital. LUMO stands for lowest unoccupied molecular orbital. The energy difference between the HOMO and LUMO is termed the HOMO-LUMO gap. HOMO and LUMO are sometimes referred to as frontier orbitals.

Each molecular orbital has a calculated energy level. Chemists sort the molecular orbitals (MOs) by energy levels. Chemists assume that the electrons will occupy the lowest energy level MOs first. For example, if a molecule has enough electrons to fill 15 MOs, the 15 MOs with the lowest energy levels will be occupied. The 15th MO on the list would be called the "highest occupied molecular orbital" (HOMO) and the 16th MO on the list would be the "lowest unoccupied molecular orbital" (LUMO). The difference in the HOMO's energy level and the LUMO's energy level is called the band gap. The band gap can sometimes serve as a measure of the excitability of the molecule: the smaller the energy, the more easily a molecule's electrons will be excited. For example, this can help predict whether a substance will have luminescence.

[[Substituent]]

CATEGORIES: Organic chemistry, Chemical nomenclature

In organic chemistry and biochemistry, substituent is the name for a single atom or for a group of atoms that take the position of another atom in a molecule. They replace this atom. This reaction is called a substitution reaction. The atom or group of atoms that gets replaced is called the leaving group.

The terms substituent, side chain, group, branch, or pendant group are used in the same way to describe branches from a parent structure. These terms have different meanings in polymer chemistry.  In polymers, side chains extend from a backbone structure, while they are attached to the alpha carbon atoms of the amino acid backbone in proteins. 

Organic chemistry has rules for naming compounds with substituent groups. The substituent group is listed first with a suffix to describe how it is attached to the main carbon chain. The suffix -yl is used when naming organic compounds that contain a single bond replacing one hydrogen. -ylidene and -ylidyne are used for double bonds and triple bonds respectively. When naming hydrocarbons that contain a substituent, position numbers may be used. These number will indicate which carbon atom the substituent is attached to. One case where this information is needed is that of isomers.

The phrases most-substituted and least-substituted are often used to describe molecules and predict their products. For example:

CATEGORIES: Compositions by Richard Strauss, Orchestral works

Till Eulenspiegel's Merry Pranks (German: Till Eulenspiegels lustige Streiche) is a very well-known piece of music for orchestra by Richard Strauss.  It is a tone poem (a piece of music which tells some kind of story).  In this work, Richard Strauss describes the adventures of Till Eulenspiegel who was the character in a series of stories written in Germany many years ago.  Till Eulenspiegel was a kind of folk hero.  He was a naughty boy who got up to all kinds of tricks.  The music is very humorous and describes his adventures.

The music is played by a large orchestra.  There is a small clarinet (normally an E flat clarinet, although in Strauss's day he used a D clarinet) that describes the character of Till.  Till is also represented by a French horn.

While at Pasadena City College, he set junior college records in several events.   He won a silver medal at the 1936 Summer Olympics.  He came in second to Jesse Owens in the 200m.  Robinson later ran for the University of Oregon.  While there, he won National Collegiate Athletic Association and Amateur Athletic Union titles.  He is a member of the Oregon Sports Hall of Fame.  Robinson spent his later years working for the city of Pasadena as a garbage collector and mailman.  He tried to stop crime in the black neighborhoods of Pasadena.  Robinson died in Pasadena in 2000.  Several landmarks in Pasadena honor both Jackie and Mack Robinson, including the stadium at PCC.  

[[Diene]]

CATEGORIES: Hydrocarbons

In organic chemistry, a diene (ˈ DY) or diolefin (d dy) is a hydrocarbon that contains two carbon pi bonds. 

Conjugated dienes are functional groups, with a general formula of CnH2n-2. Dienes and alkynes are functional isomers. Dienes occur occasionally in nature but are widely used in the polymer industry.

[[Conjugated system]]

CATEGORIES: Organic chemistry

In chemistry, a conjugated system is a system of connected p-orbitals with delocalized electrons. Conjugated systems are created by several multiple bonds, each separated by single bonds. In general, conjugated systems may lower the overall energy of the molecule and increase how steady it is. They can contain lone pairs, radicals or carbonium ions. The compound may be cyclic, acyclic, linear or mixed. In most cases, the atoms in a molecule are held together by single bonds (where orbitals from adjacent atoms overlap).  Molecules which have a conjugated system have unique properties different from normal compounds created by the sharing of the delocalized electrons among many atoms.

Conjugation is the overlap of one p-orbital with another across a sigma bond (or single bond) that is in between. (The d-orbitals of larger atoms can also contribute to a conjugated system).

A conjugated system has a region of overlapping p-orbitals, bridging the single bonds that are between. They allow a delocalization of pi electrons across all the adjacent aligned p-orbitals.

The pi electrons do not belong to a single bond or atom, but rather to a group of atoms.

The largest conjugated systems (with the greatest number of shared electrons) are in graphite, conductive polymers, and carbon nanotubes.

[[Woodward's rules]]

CATEGORIES: Organic chemistry

Woodward's rules are a set of rules about how organic chemical compounds absorb ultraviolet light.

They give information about the wavelength of the absorption maximum (symbol λmax ) in an ultraviolet-visible (UV) spectrum of a compound.  The rules are named after Robert Burns Woodward. He was a Harvard University professor who won the 1965 Nobel Prize in chemistry. The rules are sometimes called the Woodward-Fieser rules, to also honor Louis Fieser. 

The rules build the prediction on the type of chromophores present, the substituents on the chromophores, and changes due to the solvent. Examples are conjugated carbonyl compounds, conjugated dienes, and polyenes.

[[Shoaling and schooling]]

CATEGORIES: Fish, Ethology

Schooling and shoaling is a kind of collective animal behaviour by fish.

Any group of fish that stays together for social reasons is said to be shoaling, and if the shoal is swimming in the same direction together, it is schooling.p365 About one quarter of fish shoal all their lives, and about one half of fish shoal for part of their lives.

Fish get many benefits from shoaling. These include defence against predators: if fish swim in schools, it is less likely any one of them will be eaten. Also, it may help a fish find food, and a mate. The school may even swim faster than a lone fish.

Fish generally prefer larger shoals, shoalmates of their own species, shoalmates similar in size and appearance to themselves, healthy fish, and kin (when recognized).

Any shoal member which stands out in appearance may be targeted by predators. This may explain why fish prefer to shoal with individuals that resemble themselves. This is called the oddity effect.

[[U.S. Route 40]]

CATEGORIES: U.S. Highways

U.S. Route 40 is a federal highway from Park City, Utah to Atlantic City, New Jersey.  It is 2,286 miles long and passes through twelve states.  It used to go from Park City to Reno, Nevada and San Francisco, California, but that route is now part of Interstate 80.  Much of the eastern part of U.S. Route 40, from Vandalia, Illinois to Cumberland, Maryland (or from St. Louis, Missouri to Baltimore) was part of the National Road.  This part has been around since 1839.  Part of U.S. Route 40 was also called the "Lincoln Highway".

U.S. Route 40 passes or passed through many cities.  Some of these are:

The current capitals are Denver, Topeka, Indianapolis, and Columbus. Vandalia was a former capital of Illinois, Zanesville was a former capital of Ohio, and Wheeling was a former capital of West Virginia. 

[[Physical chemistry]]

CATEGORIES: Chemistry

Physical chemistry uses physics to study chemical systems.  It studies them at macroscopic, atomic, subatomic, and particulate levels.  It looks at concepts like motion, energy, force, time, thermodynamics, quantum chemistry, statistical mechanics and dynamics.

Physical chemistry is not the same as chemical physics. Physical chemistry is mostly a macroscopic or supra-molecular science. The majority of physical chemistry concepts relate to bulk properties rather than to molecular/atomic structure alone. These include chemical equilibrium and colloids.

Some of the relationships that physical chemistry tries to resolve include the effects of:

[[Ozone depletion]]

CATEGORIES: Atmosphere

Ozone is a gas that is present in the ozone layer in the stratosphere of the Earth. There, it will absorb almost all ultraviolet light which is harmful to many organisms. The term Ozone depletion can refer to a number of distinct, but related phenomena:

The details of polar ozone hole formation differ from that of mid-latitude thinning, but the most important process in both is catalytic destruction of ozone by atomic halogens. The main source of these halogen atoms in the stratosphere is photodissociation of man-made halocarbon refrigerants (CFCs, freons, halons.) These compounds are transported into the stratosphere after being emitted at the surface.

Both types of ozone depletion were observed to increase as emissions of Halocarbons increased.

CFCs and other substances contributing to this effect are referred to as ozone-depleting substances (ODS). Since the ozone layer prevents most harmful UVB wavelengths (280–315 nm) of ultraviolet light (UV light) from passing through the Earth's atmosphere, observed and projected decreases in ozone have generated worldwide concern. As a result, the Montreal Protocol  has been adopted. The treaty bans the production of CFCs, halons as and other ozone-depleting chemicals such as carbon tetrachloride and trichloroethane. The biological consequences  of this change in ozone levels may include an increases in skin cancer, cataracts, damage to plants, and the reduction of plankton populations in the ocean.

Estimates of how quickly the ozone layer will regenerate vary by about two decades. NASA estimated in 2006, that it wil take to 2068 for the ozone layer in Antarctica to recover to the level before human-induced thinning.  According to the World Meteorological Organization, the state of the ozone layer over Antarctica will not change noticeably in the next twenty years. The state before 1980 will be reached between 2060 and 2075, 25 years later than predicted in 2002. Over the Arctic, there will be bigger losses in ozone over the next fifteen years, esp. in cold winters. For the Arctic regions, the state before 1980 will be reached around 2050.

[[Photodissociation]]

CATEGORIES: Chemistry

Photodissociation, photolysis, or photodecomposition is a chemical reaction in which a chemical compound is broken down by photons. One or more photons interact with the target molecule.

Photodissociation is not limited to visible light.  Any photon with sufficient energy can affect the chemical bonds of a chemical compound.  Since a photon's energy is inversely proportional to its wavelength, electromagnetic waves with the energy of visible light or higher, such as ultraviolet light, x-rays and gamma rays are usually involved in such reactions.

One example where this is used is the Light-dependent reaction of photosynthesis. Far more enegetic photons of ultraviolet light (240 nm and shorter) can break the bonds of oxygen molecules. The newly independent oxygen atoms create ozone in the ozone layer.

[[Vector calculus]]

CATEGORIES: Linear algebra, Vectors

Vector calculus is a branch of mathematics that investigates vector fields and how they change over time. Vector calculus usually studies two- or three-dimensional vector fields, but can be used in higher dimensions, too. It is a part of the study of multivariable calculus. Vector calculus is useful in physics and engineering because of how it can look at electromagnetic and gravitational fields.

[[Vector field]]

CATEGORIES: Linear algebra, Vectors

A vector field is a function that assigns to every point in space a vector. It can be imagined as a collection of arrows, each one attached to a different point in space. For example, the wind (the velocity of air) can be represented by a vector field. This is because in every point one can write an arrow showing the direction of the wind and its strength. 

Vector calculus is the study of vector fields.

[[Multivariable calculus]]

CATEGORIES: Calculus

In calculus, multivariable calculus is the extension of regular, one-dimensional calculus to more than one dimension. Most of the concepts from calculus, such as continuity and chain rule, still work in more than one dimension, though sometimes with greater complexity and counter-intuitive result.

[[Xiaotingia]]

CATEGORIES: Jurassic dinosaurs, Coelurosaurs, Feathered dinosaurs

Xiaotingia is an extinct genus of Archaeopteryx-like theropod dinosaur from early Upper Jurassic deposits of western Liaoning, China.

The Chinese team claims the fossils dated to 155 million years ago (mya), whereas the Solnhofen limestone where Archaeopteyx was found is 144 mya in age. The  new fossil Xiaotingia cannot be dated so accurately, as they were originally been purchased from a dealer. Prof Xu first saw the specimen at the Shandong Tianyu Museum. The other question to be asked of all early dinobirds is: could they fly? 

A cladistic analysis by Xu and his team showed that Xiaotingia formed a clade with Archaeopteryx, the Dromaeosauridae and the Troodontidae. This clade excludes other birds. They therefore (re)defined the concepts of Deinonychosauria and Avialae so Archaeopteryx and Xiaotingia belonged to the Deinonychosauria and Archaeopteryx no longer was an avian (bird). This led to popular reports that "Archaeopteryx is no longer a bird". 

However, the team explicitly allowed for a traditional Aves with Archaeopteryx as a specifier. Such a clade would in their opinion include the Deinonychosauria.

[[Double bond]]

A double bond in chemistry is when two chemical elements are joined together in a chemical bond and share four bonding electrons instead of the usual two. The most common double bond is between two carbon atoms, and can be found in alkenes. There are many types of double bonds, such as in a carbonyl group with a carbon atom and an oxygen atom. Other common double bonds are found in azo compounds (N=N), imines (C=N) and sulfoxides (S=O). In skeletal formula the double bond is shown as two parallel lines (=) between the two joined atoms. When this formula is printed, the equals sign is used.

Double bonds are stronger than single bonds and double bonds are also shorter. The bond order is two. Double bonds are also electron-rich, which makes them more reactive.

The two pairs of electrons involved in the bond do not behave in exactly the same way. One pair of electrons forms a stronger sigma bond, noted by σ and drawn as a straight line between the nuclei of the bonding atoms. While the other pair form a pi bond, π, drawn as two cloud-like areas where the electrons exist, as orbitals.

[[Tornado warning]]

CATEGORIES: Tornadoes

A tornado warning is an alert that means that a tornado or funnel cloud has been spotted around the area, and that people should take cover. When tornadoes have been spotted, the tornado sirens make sound in that place, letting people know that they have been seen.

Tornado warnings are higher than the warning of a Tornado watch, but there is an even higher level, which is a tornado emergency.

[[Tornado watch]]

CATEGORIES: Tornadoes

A tornado watch is a warning that means that weather conditions are right for tornadoes to form. So people should be careful.

A tornado watch must not be confused with a tornado warning. It does not mean that a tornado has been seen; it just means that you should be careful because the weather is perfect for a tornado.

[[Dust devil]]

CATEGORIES: Weather, Tornadoes

Dust devils are twirling masses of air that form in the desert and send sand spinning. The height of a dust devil can range from a few meters tall to more than 1,000 tall. They are usually harmless, but occasionally they can cause some damage to both people and property.

[[Samaritan Pentateuch]]

CATEGORIES: Theology, Judaism

The Samaritan Pentateuch or Samaritan Torah is a special version of the Torah used by the Samaritans. This version was created at the latest 127 BC, when the Temple in Jerusalem was destroyed, and the Samaritans split from the other group in the Temple. As the name says, this version contains the first five books of Moses, or the Torah.

Scholars use the Samaritan Pentateuch when they want to find the meaning of words in the original Pentateuch or if they want to learn about the history of the different versions of the Bible. Some scrolls among the Dead Sea scrolls look like Samaritan Pentateuch.

Samaritan practices are based on their version of the Five Books of Moses, which is slightly different from the Masoretic text or the Greek Septuagint texts. Some differences are small, such as the ages of different people mentioned in genealogy, while others are major, such as the commandment to only have one wife which appears in the Samaritan text but not in the other versions. (See .)

Special importance is attached to the Abisha Scroll, which is used in the Samaritan synagogue of Nablus. The Samaritans claim it was penned by Abishua, great-grandson of Aaron (1), thirteen years after the entry into the land of Israel under the leadership of Joshua, son of Nun. But modern scholars have observed that the scroll appears to include work by different scribes from different centuries, with the oldest texts dating to the 12th century A.D.

[[John Jacob Astor]]

CATEGORIES: Businesspeople from New York, People from New York City, 1763 births, 1848 deaths

John Jacob Astor (July 17, 1763 – March 29, 1848), born Johann Jakob Astor, was a German-American businessman.  He was born in Germany and moved to London and then to New York City in 1784.  He started a business trading furs.  By 1800, he had made half a million dollars trading furs.  His company was called The Pacific Fur Trading Company. In the early 1800s, his company was trading furs in Oregon.  His fur traders found the pass through which the Oregon Trail passes.  He made even more money in New York real estate.  When he died in 1848, he was worth over $50 million.  Today, his fortune would be over $150 billion.  The city of Astoria, Oregon was named for him.  So was the neighborhood Astoria, Queens and Astor Place in Manhattan.

[[Pi bond]]

CATEGORIES: Chemical bonding

In chemistry, a pi bond (π bond) is a covalent chemical bonds where the orbital path of one electron crosses (overlaps) with the path of another. The electrons have a lobe shaped figure of eight path (see picture). There are two areas of overlap as the paths overlap on both lobes. Only one of the orbital's nodal planes passes through both of the involved nuclei. 

The Greek letter π in their name refers to p orbitals. The orbital symmetry of the pi bond looks the same as the p orbital when seen down the bond axis. P orbitals usually have this sort of bonding. D orbitals are also assumed to use pi bonding but this is not necessarily what happens in reality. The idea of bonding d orbitals fits in with the theory of hypervalence.

Pi bonds are usually weaker than sigma bonds. Quantum mechanics says this is because the orbital paths are parallel so there is much less overlap between the p-orbitals. 

Pi bonds happen when two atomic orbitals are in contact through two areas of overlap.  Pi-bonds are more spread out bonds than the sigma bonds. Electrons in pi bonds are sometimes called pi electrons. Molecular fragments joined by a pi bond cannot rotate about that bond without breaking the pi bond. The rotation destroys the parallel paths of the two p orbitals.

[[Being and Time]]

[[Chesil Beach]]

CATEGORIES: Beaches of Europe, Dorset, Geography of England

Chesil Beach, sometimes called Chesil Bank, in Dorset, southern England is one of three major shingle structures in Britain. Its name is derived from the Old English ceosel or cisel, meaning "gravel" or "shingle". 

It is a kind of offshore barrier which has joined the mainland with Portland Bill. The lagoon between the chesil and the mainland is called The Fleet or The Fleet Lagoon.

The shingle beach is 18 miles long (29km), 220 yards wide  (200m) and 50 feet high (15m). The beach and the Fleet are part of the Jurassic Coast, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the location for a book, On Chesil Beach by Ian McEwan.

At the eastern end of the beach at the village of Chiswell, against the cliffs of the Isle of Portland, the beach curves round sharply to form Chesil Cove. This part of the beach protects the low-lying village from flooding. Westwards the shingle forms a straight line along the coast, enclosing the Fleet, a shallow tidal lagoon. The lagoon is 9½ feet (3m) at its deepest.p99

The beach provides shelter from the prevailing winds (from the west) and waves for the town of Weymouth and the village of Chiswell, which would otherwise probably not exist

Varying with the Bank's unbroken increase in height, to 14.7, above mean high water, the size of the flint and chert shingle varies from pea-sized at the north-west end (by West Bay) to orange-sized at the south-east end (by Portland). It is said that smugglers who landed on the beach in the middle of the night could judge "exactly where they were" by the size of the shingle.

It covers an area of 863,500 square meters (213 acres). Happy Valley contains seven big areas, each with different themed zones, including Sunshine Beach, Happy Times, Typhoon Bay, Gold Mine Town, Ant Kingdom, Shanghai Beach and Shangri-la Woods. There are more than 100 rides in the park.

The park was opened on August 16, 2009. In the beginning of the park's operation, many people didn't like it because of long waiting times and being dangerous. Most of the rides were broken, the lines were too long, and many people were hurt not only from riding the rides, but from walking around the park. Three people were hurt when a big sign board fell on top of them.

The park currently has six roller coasters. Five of them were opened when the park began its operation while the mine train coaster opened in October 2009.

[[Pithole, Pennsylvania]]

CATEGORIES: Settlements in Pennsylvania, Ghost towns in the United States, Venango County, Pennsylvania

Pithole or Pithole City is a ghost town in Cornplanter Township, Venango County in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania.  It is about 6 from Oil Creek State Park and the Drake Well Museum.  The first oil well was in that area. The quick growing of Pithole and then fast decline made it one of the most famous of the oil boomtowns.

Oil was found at wells close to Pithole in January 1865.  A large number of people moved to the area.  Many of these people were land speculators.  The town was built in May. By December, the area became an official town with about 20,000 people living in it. Pithole had at least 54 hotels, 3 churches, the third biggest post office in Pennsylvania, a newspaper, a theater, a railroad, the world's first pipeline, and a red-light district "the likes of Dodge City's". By 1866, less oil was being made in Pithole. Oil was found in other towns near Pithole.  This made many people from Pithole leave to live in those places. By 1877, the town no longer existed.https://archive.org/details/historyofvenango00bell

The site was cleared of plants and was given to the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission in 1961. A visitors center with information about the history of Pithole, was built in the 1970s. Pithole was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.

[[Defence against predators]]

CATEGORIES: Coevolution, Ecology

For most animals, defence against predators is vital. Being eaten is not the only threat to life: parasites and diseases may also be fatal. But animals, especially small animals, are often eaten. 

Since life is about reproduction, anything that keeps a creature alive long enough for it to reproduce will be selected for. The next generation comes from the fertilised eggs of the previous generation.

Not surprisingly, then, animals have developed a wide range of defences against predation. Some of these defences apply also to plants: herbivory on plants can be very damaging, and reduce a plant's fertility. Many plants have some defence against herbivores.

[[Boomtown]]

CATEGORIES: Settlements

A boomtown is a place that has very quick population and economic growth. Boomtowns are usually mining towns where an important mineral resource such as gold, silver, or petroleum has been found.

The word can also be used for places that grow for other reasons.  This can be the town being near a major city, in a nice climate or near a popular attraction.

[[Egyptian temple]]

CATEGORIES: Ancient Egypt

Egyptian temples were buildings for the official worship of the gods in ancient Egypt. These temples were seen as houses for the gods. Sometimes they were specially for the pharaohs (kings). Within these temples the Egyptians performed a variety of rituals of the Egyptian religion. People would give offerings (gifts) to the gods. They would show the stories of the gods through festivals. These festivals would also help normal life to continue. The pharaohs were responsible for providing the temples and caring for the gods. This required a lot of labor and material for building and maintenance. It was necessary for the pharaohs to give this responsibility to priests. Most of the ordinary people did not take part in ceremonies and could not enter special parts of the temple. The temple was an important religious place for all classes of Egyptians. They went there to pray, give offerings, and seek guidance from the god dwelling within.

The most important part of the temple was the sanctuary. The sanctuary was the most secret and special place and usually had a statue of a god. In the early years of Egypt, about 3000 BCE, the temples were small. Priests and pharaohs added more rooms and the temples became bigger. The rooms would have a lot of decoration of the religion. By the time of the New Kingdom (c.1550-1070 BCE) the temples were huge buildings made of stone. The buildings were arranged in special ways for the religion. The temple would have halls, open areas, and very large entrance pillars. Some of these temples still exist today. Beyond the main temple was an outer wall. There would be other buildings inside the walls.

A large temple also had a lot of land and employed thousands of ordinary people to supply its needs. Temples were also economic centers. The priests who managed the temples had a lot of influence. They would sometimes oppose the king.

Temple-building continued in Egypt even when the nation declined and was ruled by the Roman Empire. Christianity brought more pressure on Egyptian religion. The last temple was closed in 550 CE. For hundreds of years, the ancient buildings were damaged and neglected. In the early 19th century, many people in Europe became interested in ancient Egypt. The study of ancient Egypt became known as the science of Egyptology. Egyptologists continue to study the surviving temples and the remains of destroyed ones. They tell us a lot about ancient Egyptian society.

Dozens of temples survive today. Some have become famous tourist attractions that bring money to modern Egypt.

The red admiral (Vanessa atalanta) is a well-known colourful butterfly, found in temperate Europe, Asia and North America. It has a 45 wing span. The species is resident only in warmer areas, but migrates north in spring, and sometimes again in autumn.

In northern Europe, it is one of the last butterflies to be seen before winter sets in, often feeding on the flowers of ivy on sunny days. The red admiral is also known to hibernate, re-emerging individuals showing prominently darker colourings than first brood subjects. The butterfly also flies on sunny winter days, especially in southern Europe.

In North America, the red admiral generally has two broods from March through October. Most of North America must be recolonized each spring by southern migrants, but this species over-winters in south Texas.

[[Meadow brown]]

CATEGORIES: Nymphalidae

The meadow brown, Maniola jurtina, is a butterfly found in European meadows, where its larvae feed on grasses.

There is some sexual dimorphism in this species. Males are less colourful, with smaller eyespots and much reduced orange areas on the upper forewings. They are also much more active and range far about, while females fly less and often may not away from the area where they grew up.

The evolutionary significance of the upperwing eyespots is probably attack deflection. Small, peripherally located eyespots act as attractors to deflect the attacks of predators to non-vital parts of the body.

[[Musk ox]]

CATEGORIES: Caprids, Mammals of North America

The musk ox (Ovibos moschatus, muskox) is a large Arctic mammal of the Bovidae family.

It has a thick coat, and was common in the northern hemisphere during the Pleistocene ice age. The males give off a strong odour, hence its name. This musky odour is used to attract females during mating season. Musk oxen travel in herds of females and their young led by one or two strong males. Male oxen fight over who will be leader by butting their thick heads and horns against each other. The musk oxen's long, curved horns keep away predators. When a herd smells nearby wolves, all the musk oxen form a circle and face out. They lower their heads to show off their horns.

Musk oxen live in Arctic North America and Greenland, with small introduced populations in Sweden, Siberia and Norway.

Musk oxen are herbivores which graze on grasses, leaves, and some Arctic flowers. They are ruminants; they swallow their food without chewing it. Later, they regurgitate the food (called a cud) and chew it. Musk oxen, like other ruminants, have a stomach with four sections.

Fossil DNA evidence suggests musk oxen were not only more geographically widespread during the Pleistocene, but also more genetically diverse. During that time, other populations of musk oxen lived across the Arctic, from the Ural Mountains to Greenland. Together with the bison and the pronghorn, the muskox was one of a few species of Pleistocene megafauna in North America to survive the Pleistocene/Holocene extinction event and live to the present day.

[[Plover]]

CATEGORIES: Charadriiformes

Plovers are water birds birds belonging to the subfamily Charadriinae. There are about 40 species, most of them called 'plover' or 'dotterel'.  The closely related lapwing subfamily, Vanellinae, has another 20-odd species.

Plovers are found throughout the world, and have short bills. They wade in the water, and hunt by sight, rather than by feel as longer-billed waders like snipe do. 

They feed mainly on insects, worms or other invertebrates. They use a run-and-pause technique, rather than the steady probing of some other waders.

The plover group of birds has a defence against predators called false brooding. They sit on an imaginary nest site, changing position sometimes as if real eggs were under them.

The plover has been known to attack when the young are threatened. The birds secrete an acidic compound from a gland located in their mouth. On contact with skin causes a burning sensation.

[[Ragtime]]

CATEGORIES: African-American history, American music, Dance music

Ragtime (or rag-time) is a musical genre which enjoyed its peak popularity between 1897 and 1918.

Its main characteristic trait is its syncopated, or 'ragged', rhythm. It began as dance music in the red-light districts of American cities such as St. Louis and New Orleans years before being published as popular sheet music for piano.

Ragtime was a modification of the march made popular by John Philip Sousa, with additional polyrhythms typical of African music. The ragtime composer Scott Joplin became famous through the publication in 1899 of the Maple Leaf Rag and a string of ragtime hits that followed. For at least 12 years after its publication, the Maple Leaf Rag heavily influenced subsequent ragtime composers with its melody lines, harmonic progressions or metric patterns.

Ragtime fell out of favor as jazz claimed the public's imagination after 1917, but there have been numerous revivals since. First, in the early 1940s many jazz bands began to include ragtime in their repertoire and put out ragtime recordings on 78 rpm records. A more significant revival occurred in the 1950s as a wider variety of ragtime styles of the past were made available on records, and new rags were composed, published, and recorded.

In 1971 Joshua Rifkin brought out a compilation of Scott Joplin's work which was nominated for a Grammy Award. In 1973, the motion picture The Sting brought ragtime to a wide audience with its soundtrack of Joplin tunes. Subsequently, the film's rendering of Joplin's 1902 rag The Entertainer was a Top 5 hit in 1974.

Ragtime (with Joplin's work in the forefront) has been cited as an American equivalent of minuets by Mozart, mazurkas by Chopin, or waltzes by Brahms. Ragtime influenced classical composers including Erik Satie, Claude Debussy and Igor Stravinsky. Ragtime was included in the dance styles of Vernon and Irene Castle, and influenced the English ballroom dances, the foxtrot and the quickstep.
