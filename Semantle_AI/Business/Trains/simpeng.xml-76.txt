Divergent means that as you add more terms the sum never stops getting bigger. It does not go towards a single finite value.

Apart from the first term, every term of the series is the harmonic mean of the terms either side of it. The phrase harmonic mean also comes from music.

[[Masked tree frog]]

CATEGORIES: Frogs, Animals of South America

The masked tree frog, New Granada cross-banded tree frog, Tarraco treefrog, or Central American smilisca (Smilisca phaeota) is a frog that lives in Honduras, Nicaragua, Ecuador, Costa Rica and Colombia. Scientists have seen it as high in the hills as 3300 meters above sea level.

This frog is called the masked tree frog because it has dark skin around its eyes so it looks like it is wearing a black mask. The black mask covers their eyes, which helps them hide from predators.

This frog hides during the day and looks for food at night.  The frog sleeps on top of large leaves, in ferns, or inside rolled-up leaves.  Scientists think this frog eats insects and other animals without spines.  This frog can change color.  It can be tan during the day and turn green at night.

The male frog sits next to a small pool of rainwater and sings "wrauk" for the females.  The females lay 2000 eggs at a time, which float on the surface of the water.  The tadpoles grow into frogs quickly before the rainwater dries up.

[[Makhnovia]]

CATEGORIES: Anarchism, Ukraine

Makhnovia, also called the Free Territory of Ukraine, existed from 1918 to 1921. It was formed in an attempt to create a stateless anarchist society. This took place during the Ukrainian Revolution of 1917 to 1921. "Free soviets" and libertarian communes were set up and operated under the protection of Nestor Makhno's Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army.

Makhnovia was established when Huliaipole was captured by Makhno's forces on 27 November 1918. Huliapole became the territory's de facto capital. The Ukrainian peasants refused to pay rent to the landowners and "...seized the estates and livestock of the pomeshchiks, kulaks, monasteries and State holdings: in so doing, they always set up local committees to manage these assets, with an eye to sharing them out among the various villages and communes."

Russian forces of the White movement under Anton Denikin occupied part of the region and formed a temporary government of Southern Russia in March 1920. In late March 1920, Denikin's forces were pushed back by Makno's forces and the Red Army. Makhnovia was disestablished in 1921 when Makhno and 77 of his men escaped. Remnants of the Black Army would continue to fight until late 1922.

[[Frame rate]]

CATEGORIES: Movie industry, Graphics

Frame rate is a way of describing video. It refers to the number of images, called frames, that are being shown every second. It is measured in frames per second, or FPS.

Early silent movies were shown at a frame rate between 16 and 24 frames per second. This went up to 20 and 26 FPS later. When movies with sound came out 24 FPS became the standard because it was in the middle of the frame rates theaters used.

Video games are usually played at a frame rate of 60 frames per second. This is because it is a very common refresh rate (display speed) for computer monitors. They also can run at 30 FPS, or even more, such as 144 FPS or 240 FPS, depending on what the monitor can handle. If the frame rate is higher than the refresh rate, not all of the frames can be shown. If two or more frames are displayed at the same time, it can cause problems like screen tearing.

[[Screen tearing]]

CATEGORIES: Graphics

Screen tearing is a type of video error. It can happen when multiple video frames are displayed at a single time on a computer monitor. The frames will each be shown on different parts of the screen, and can leave horizontal lines if the pictures are different at the point.

Screen tearing can be stopped by synchronizing the frames that are put on the screen. Vertical synchronization, or VSync, is one popular way. Another way is FreeSync or G-Sync, but these options only work with certain GPUs and monitors.

All the wires of the circuit are connected to metal pins, and they stick out of the package on two sides. This way the circuit is able to be used from inside the package.

Things can also be put in a dual in-line package that are not integrated circuits. A DIP switch is one example of this, where there are switches on top of the package instead of a circuit inside.

At least 11 people killed themselves in the hotel.

As of 2019, the hotel has 301 rooms for people who want to live there for a long time and 299 hotel rooms.  Some of the hotel rooms are regular private hotel rooms and some are meant to be like a European hostel, where people who didn't know each other would be expected to share the room.  The owners are currently rebuilding the hotel to make it nicer and newer.  They plan for it to have 30 fewer rooms in 2021 to make space for other things.

[[Multiple integral]]

CATEGORIES: Mathematical analysis

In calculus and mathematical analysis, an integral is a way to calculate the limiting value a function with one variable will tend towards. Graphically, this can then be shown as the area under the graph of the function. In multivariate calculus, It is also possible to calculate integrals for functions with more than one variable. These integrals are commonly referred to as multiple integrals.  

An integral for a function with two variables over a two-dimensional region, called double integral, can be shown as a surface in three dimensional space. Similarly, an integral for a function with three variables over a three-dimensional region, called triple integral, can be thought of as a hypervolume.  

A double integral can also be used to define an integral over an arbitrary surface (surface integral), just like a triple integral can be used to define an integral over an arbitrary volume (volume integral).

[[Citizen science]]

CATEGORIES: Society, Science

Citizen science is when regular people help scientists study the world.  Citizen scientists usually collect information and send it to a team of scientists, who examine and process it.  Most citizen scientists are volunteers and do not get paid.

Sometimes scientists ask for help from people who are collecting information anyway.  For example, scientists studying birds might ask birdwatchers to record which birds they see and hear and then tell the scientists.  The National Audubon Society has been running a Christmas Bird Count since 1900.

Smartphones and GPS have made citizen science easier to do and easier for scientists to ask for and use.  For example, in FrogWatch USA, citizen scientists go to places where frogs live and use their phones to make recordings of the sounds they hear.

Not all citizen science programs mean going outside.  In EyeWire, volunteers visit a website and click on what they can see.  This helps scientists tell how the brain works with things the eyes see.

In other citizen science programs, volunteers measure temperature to track climate change, tell scientists when different plants start to grow in the spring, search for aliens in space, and design better bicycle routes.

Taking place soon after the German retreat to the Hindenburg Line and Operation Alberich, the movie is about two young British soldiers who were given a mission to deliver a message calling off a doomed offensive attack.

Filming took place from April to June 2019 in the UK, with cinematographer Roger Deakins and editor Lee Smith using long takes to have the entire movie appear as two continuous shots.

1917 premiered in the UK on 4 December 2019 and was released theatrically in the United States on 25 December by Universal Pictures and in the United Kingdom on 10 January 2020 by Entertainment One. The movie received widespread critical praise and was a box office success, grossing $384 million worldwide.

In mathematics, a window function is a special function that can be applied to a signal, as it occurs in digital signal processing. A window function has a value of zero outside the domain which is of interest, and a non-zero value inside this domain. When multiplied with the signal (function), the result will be zero outside the domain of interest, and non-zero inside it - it will only leave the "window". The simplest possible window function is rectangular: It is 1 inside the domain of interest, and zero everywhere else. It is named Dirichlet window (after Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet).  Many window functions are symmetric around the center (which is often in the middle of the interval). They will amplify or weaken the signal in certain positions,

Arawanna,Ara-Wanna(I҆rwnt). The Hittite-Luwian city-state and historical region of the same name in the south-west of the Armenian Highlands(near modern town of Elbistan, Ablasta in Armenian: Աբլաստա), which existed in the Bronze Age and was mentioned by king Mursili II in his annals, where he writes that when Šuppiluliuma I was king of the Hittites, the Aravanians invaded the land of Kaskians near «Sammahi». Some translators believe that this may be a Late-Hittite pronunciation of «Samuha», comparing Šuppiluliuma of the mid-14th century BC, who managed to subdue Arawanna and other city-states, which had rebelled against his father, with king Šuppiluliuma of the late 13th century BC. However, in other places of the annals Arawanna and Cascia are not connected with Samuha. King Mursili himself in the fifth year of his reign - c. 1317 BC - moved to the city of Zulila in the vicinity of Sammahi to save the Cascians from invasions near Samuha.

Arawanna took part in the coalition of states that rebelled against the Hittite king Tudhaliya III and were supported by the king of Mitanni Shuttarna II.

[[Islam in Delhi]]

CATEGORIES: Delhi, Islam in India

Delhi has the second largest Muslim population (12.86%) within Delhi State. Muhammad Ghori invaded India in 1175 A.D. After the conquest of Multan and Punjab, he advanced towards Delhi. The rajput chiefs of northern India headed by Prithvi Raj Chauhan defeated him in the First Battle of Terrain in 1191 A.D. After about a year, Muhammad Ghori came again to avenge his defeat. A furious battle was fought again in Terrain in 1192 A.D. in which the Rajputs were defeated and Prithvi Raj Chauhan was captured and put to death. The Second Battle of Terrain, however, proved to be a decisive battle that laid the foundations of Muslim rule in Northern India. Ghori built many mosques and libraries after laying muslim rule in india. The period between 1206 A.D. and 1526 A.D. in India's history is known as the Delhi Sultanate period. During this period of over three hundred years, five dynasties ruled in Delhi. These were: the Slave dynasty (1206-90), Khilji dynasty (1290-1320), Tughlaq dynasty (1320-1413), Sayyid dynasty (1414-51), and Lodhi dynasty (1451-1526).The Delhi Sultanate was an Islamic empire based in Delhi that stretched over large parts of the Indian subcontinent for 320 years (1206–1526).56 Five dynasties ruled over the Delhi Sultanate sequentially: the Mamluk/Slave dynasty (1206–1290), the Khalji dynasty (1290–1320), the Tughlaq dynasty (1320–1414),7 the Sayyid dynasty (1414–1451), and the Lodi dynasty (1451–1526). It covered large swathes of territory in modern-day India, Pakistan, Bangladesh as well as some parts of southern Nepal.8

As a successor to the Ghurid dynasty, the Delhi Sultanate was originally one among a number of principalities ruled by the Turkic slave-generals of Muhammad Ghori (who had conquered large parts of northern India), including Yildiz, Aibek and Qubacha, that had inherited and divided the Ghurid territories amongst themselves.9 After a long period of infighting, the Mamluks were overthrown in the Khalji revolution which marked the transfer of power from the Turks to a heterogeneous Indo-Muslim nobility.1011 Both of the resulting Khalji and Tughlaq dynasties respectively saw a new wave of rapid Muslim conquests deep into South India.12 The sultanate finally reached the peak of its geographical reach during the Tughlaq dynasty, occupying most of the Indian subcontinent.13 This was followed by decline due to Hindu reconquests, Hindu kingdoms such as the Vijayanagara Empire and Mewar asserting independence, and new Muslim sultanates such as the Bengal Sultanate breaking off.1415 In 1526, the Sultanate was conquered and succeeded by the Mughal Empire.

The sultanate is noted for its integration of the Indian subcontinent into a global cosmopolitan culture16 (as seen concretely in the development of the Hindustani language17 and Indo-Islamic architecture1819), being one of the few powers to repel attacks by the Mongols (from the Chagatai Khanate)20 and for enthroning one of the few female rulers in Islamic history, Razia Sultana, who reigned from 1236 to 1240.21 Bakhtiyar Khalji's annexations were responsible for the large-scale desecration of Hindu and Buddhist temples22 (leading to the decline of Buddhism in East India and Bengal2324), and the destruction of universities and libraries.2526 Mongolian raids on West and Central Asia set the scene for centuries of migration of fleeing soldiers, intelligentsia, mystics, traders, artists, and artisans from those regions into the subcontinent, thereby establishing Islamic culture in India2728 and the rest of the region.

[[Fossil water]]

CATEGORIES: Bodies of water

Fossil water or palaeowater is an ancient body of water that has been kept in an undisturbed place. Usually it is groundwater in an aquifer. It may stay underground for millions of years. Other types of fossil water can include lakes under ice, such as Antarctica's Lake Vostok. The term may be used to describe ancient water on other planets.

UNESCO defines fossil groundwater as

"water that infiltrated usually millennia ago and often under climatic conditions different from the present, and that has been stored underground since that time".

Estimating the time since water infiltrated is done using isotopes. Some aquifers are hundreds of meters deep and underlie vast areas of land. Research techniques in the field are developing quickly and the scientific knowledge base is growing. For many aquifers, research is lacking or disputed as to the age of the water and the behaviour of the water inside the aquifer.

[[Phrygian cap]]

The Phrygian cap (ˈ) or liberty cap is a soft cap, in the shape of a cone, with the apex bent over, which people in antiquity thought had to do with many different peoples in Eastern Europe and Anatolia, including Phrygia, Dacia, and the Balkans. During the French Revolution it came to mean freedom and the pursuit of liberty, but Phrygian caps did not originally have this meaning. The original cap of liberty was the Roman pileus, the felt cap of freed slaves of ancient Rome, which also had to do with Libertas, the Roman goddess of liberty. In the 16th century, the Roman icons of liberty were used again in emblem books and coin studying handbooks where the figure of Libertas is usually shown with a pileus. The most common use of a headgear as a symbol of freedom in the first two centuries after the Roman iconography was commonly used again was in the Netherlands, where the cap of liberty was used in the form of a hat of that time. In the 18th century, the traditional liberty cap was often used in English prints and from 1789 on in French prints, too; but it was not until the early 1790s, that the French cap of liberty was most often used in the Phrygian form.

It is used in the coats of arms of some republics in the place where in a monarchy a crown would be used. It thus came to be identified as a symbol of the republican form of government. A number of national personifications, most commonly France's Marianne, are usually depicted wearing the Phrygian cap.

[[Monarchy of Ireland]]

CATEGORIES: Ireland, History, Monarchy, United Kingdom, Northern Ireland, British royalty

Ireland is mostly the Republic of Ireland (which does not have a monarchy) and partly Northern Ireland (whose monarch is Elizabeth II). Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, a constitutional monarchy. Until the 20th century, all Ireland had a constitutional monarchy and was a part of the United Kingdom since 1801. Monarchies were in existence through most of the history of Ireland.

In the High Middle Ages, the Gaelic kingdoms of Ireland ended when the Normans invaded Ireland. Ireland became a fief of the Papal States (the government of the Pope). The King of England's government started to control many of the lands of Ireland. This continued until the English Reformation, when the Kingdom of England got full ownership of Ireland. The Kingdom of Ireland came into existence in the reign of Henry VIII. Henry VIII was the first to be both King of England and King of Ireland.

The Kingdom of Ireland started in 1542. Before 1603, Ireland shared a monarch with the Kingdom of England (but not with the Kingdom of Scotland) in a personal union. When Henry VIII's daughter Elizabeth I died in 1603, James VI and I became the first to be King of Ireland, King of England, and King of Scotland in a three-kingdom personal union. Between 1603 and 1707, the Kingdom of Ireland shared the monarchs of the Kingdom of Scotland and the Kingdom of England. Anne was the Queen of Ireland when the United Kingdom of Great Britain came into existence in 1707. Anne was Queen of Ireland and Queen of Great Britain. Between 1707 and 1801, the Kingdom of Ireland shared the British monarchy with the United Kingdom of Great Britain. (During the government of Oliver Cromwell, the British Isles became a republic: the Commonwealth of England, Scotland, and Ireland.) George III was King of Ireland when the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland came into existence at the start of 1801. George III was the first to be king of the new kingdom, which combined the whole British Isles (except the Isle of Man) into one kingdom for the first time.

In December 1922, most of Ireland left the United Kingdom to become part of the Irish Free State, a dominion within the British Empire; the rest, Northern Ireland, remained within the United Kingdom. In 1937, after George V died, the Free State changed its laws to give the British monarchs much less power. In April 1949, the Republic of Ireland stopped having a monarchy entirely, and left the Commonwealth of Nations. Since then, the only part of Ireland to have a monarchy is Northern Ireland (because it is part of the United Kingdom). Elizabeth II is the present queen. Charles, Prince of Wales is the heir apparent.

It is remembered because there was a poem written by Alfred, Lord Tennyson that praised the bravery of the soldiers. It was also seen as a symbol of the failures of British rulers during that time.

[[Nuthatch]]

CATEGORIES: Passeri

The nuthatches are  Sitta, a genus of small passerine birds in the family Sittidae. They live in the Northern Hemisphere.

They have large heads, short tails, and powerful bills and feet. Nuthatches advertise their territory with loud, simple songs. Most species have grey or bluish upperparts and a black eye stripe.

They live in forests, often pine coniferous forests, on higher land (montane forests). As usual in such places, insects, nuts and seeds are their food.

Nuthatches use holes in trees for nests. This means they compete with squirrels and woodpeckers for these holes. In fact both squirrels and the great spotted woodpecker kill nuthatches if they can. Owls and hawks also kill these small birds, but that is not to do with their nest-holes. In defence of their nests, nuthatches make the entrances smaller by packing the edges with mud or tree resin. Predation is not really a threat, just a fact of life for them. Loss of coniferous forest in some countries is a threat. They cannot live except in trees.

All nuthatches store food, especially seeds. They hide seeds in tree crevices, in the ground, under small stones, or behind bark flakes.  These stores are remembered for as long as 30 days.

[[Serbian three-finger salute]]

The three-finger salute (три прста, "three fingers"), usually known as the Serb salute, is a salute which, at first, represented the Holy Trinity, was used when making oaths, and as a symbol of Serbian Orthodoxy, but today it is usually a gesture for ethnic Serbs and Serbia. It is made by stretching out the thumb, index, and middle fingers of one or both hands. 

In Serbian and Orthodox tradition, the number three is very important. Three fingers are used when signing the cross in Orthodoxy, to represent the three parts of the Trinity. In history, Serbs used the three-finger salute when they were making oaths. Often, the salute was done with both hands above the head. A Serbian proverb says that "There is no cross without three fingers" (нема крста без три прста). Karađorđe was made the leader of the First Serbian Uprising after all the members of the uprising raised their "three fingers in the air" and by doing that swore an oath to him.

[[Maine Coon]]

CATEGORIES: Cat breeds

The Maine Coon is the biggest cat breed used as a pet. It has a unique look and good hunting skills. It is one of the oldest natural breeds in North America, specifically native to the state of Maine, where it is the official state cat.

Nobody knows for sure how the Maine Coon got to the United States, so there are several different ideas. The breed was popular in cat shows in the late 19th century, but it almost became extinct because of long-haired breeds from overseas in the early 20th century. The Maine Coon has since been brought back and is now one of the most popular cat breeds in the USA.

The Maine Coon is a large and friendly cat, which is how it got its nickname, "the gentle giant." It is characterized by a big ruff along its chest, robust bone structure, rectangular body shape, an uneven two layered coat, and a long, bushy tail.  The breed's colors vary widely, with only lilac and chocolate disallowed for pedigree. People often say the Maine Coon has "dog-like" characteristics. Professionals notice certain health problems recurring in the breed, including feline hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and hip dysplasia, but reputable breeders use modern screening methods to minimize the frequency of these problems.

[[Hollow Earth]]

CATEGORIES: Pseudoscience

The Hollow Earth is a concept proposing that the planet Earth is entirely hollow or contains a substantial inner space. Edmond Halley suggested this in the late 17th century.   Pierre Bouguer in  tried to prove this idea false, in 1740.  Charles Hutton  could falsify the idea in his Schiehallion experiment around 1774.

It was still occasionally defended through the mid 19th century, notably by John Cleves Symmes Jr. and Jeremiah N. Reynolds, but by this time was part of popular pseudoscience and no longer a scientifically viable hypothesis.

The concept of a hollow Earth still recurs in folklore and as the premise for subterranean fiction, and a subgenre of adventure fiction (Journey to the Center of the Earth, At the Earth's Core).

[[Die casting]]

CATEGORIES: Manufacturing, Metals

Die casting is a type of metal casting that forces molten metal into the empty space of the mold. The mold is made by using two hardened tool steel dies which are machined into shape. These work like an injection mold.

Most die castings are made from non-ferrous metals (meaning they do not have iron). These metals are  zinc, copper, aluminium, magnesium, lead, pewter, and tin-based alloys. Depending on what type of metal is being cast, a hot- or cold-chamber machine is used.

The casting equipment and the metal dies are expensive. This means it is used only on things that need to be made a large number of times. It is simple to make things using die casting, and it has only four main steps. This helps keep the cost of the items lower. Die casting works well for many small- to medium-sized castings, which is why it is used to make more castings than any other casting process. Die castings have a very good surface finish (compared to other types of casting) and consistent sizes.

[[Cease and desist]]

CATEGORIES: Copyright, Legal terms, Letters

A cease and desist letter is a document sent to an individual or business to stop attempted illegal activity ("cease") and not to restart it ("desist"). The letter may warn to the individual or business that if they do not stop certain behaviour by deadlines set in the letter, then that individual or business may be sued. The same letter may also warn the individual or business to take specified actions in order to avoid being sued. When a cease and desist letter is issued by a public authority, it is called a "cease and desist order".

Although cease and desist letters are not exclusively used for stopping copyright infringement, such letters are also used to protect other issues related to intellectual property. The holder of an intellectual property right (i.e. either a copyrighted work, a trademark, or a patent) may send the cease and desist letter to tell a third party (i.e. an individual or business who is not related to the holder of the intellectual property right) that they are infringing intellectual property. The letter may contain either an offer to license the intellectual property or a very clear threat of a lawsuit. A cease and desist letter often causes both parties to make licensing negotiations, and is very often the first step towards a lawsuit.

If someone receives many cease and desist letters, it will cost a large amount of money to manage them. Each claim in the letters must be evaluated, and the person or group who receives it will have to decide what to do to sort out the cease and desist letter. Either, they would have to obtain an attorney's opinion letter, prepare for a lawsuit, and perhaps start making suitable alternatives that do not break the holder's intellectual property.

Cease and desist letters are sometimes used to intimidate the offending groups and can be used by corporations to relax the online critical speech of such groups. A company owning a trademark may send such letter to them that they are doing trademark infringement, although the actual use of the trademark by the offending group may fall under a fair use exception (which follows, in the U.S., the protection of free speech under the First Amendment).

[[Minié ball]]

CATEGORIES: Weapons

The Minié ball, or Minni ball, is a type of muzzle-loading spin-stabilized bullet for rifled muskets named after its developer, Claude-Étienne Minié, inventor of the French Minié rifle. It came to prominence in the Crimean War and American Civil War.

Rifling, the addition of spiral grooves inside a gun barrel, givesa spin to a bullet, greatly increasing the range and accuracy of a gun. Before the Minié ball, balls had to be jammed down the rifle barrel, sometimes with a mallet, and after a relatively small number of shots, gunpowder leftovers built up in the spiral grooves, which then had to be cleaned out. The development of the Minié ball was significant, because it was the first projectile that was small enough to be easily put down the barrel of a rifled long gun. Both the American Springfield Model 1861 and the British Pattern 1853 Enfield rifled muskets, the most common weapons used during the American Civil War, used the Minié ball.

The Minié ball did a lot if damage in the American Civil War. It made it really hard for surgeons to treat wounded soldiers because Minié balls shattered bones often.

[[Realism theory]]

CATEGORIES: International relations, Political philosophy

Realism theory is a way of thinking about politics and world history, that focuses on being realistic. It is one of the main styles of international relations theory. It gives the theoretic background to Realpolitik statesmanship of early modern Europe. According to Realism, world politics is always and necessarily a field of conflict among actors who want power. The theories of realism are contrasted by the cooperative ideals of liberalism.

Depending on what they see as the cause of the conflict between states, realists can be divided into three classes: Classical realists believe it follows from human nature; neorealists attribute it to the dynamics of the anarchic state system; neoclassical realists believe it results from both, in combination with domestic politics. Neorealists are also divided between defensive and offensive realism. Realists trace the history of their ideas back through classical antiquity, beginning with Thucydides.

Jonathan Haslam defines realism as "a spectrum of ideas." Its theories revolve around four main rules:

Realism is often associated with Realpolitik, as both deal with the pursuit, possession, and application of power. Realpolitik, however, is an older prescriptive guideline limited to policy-making, while realism is a wider theoretical and methodological paradigm to describe, explain, and predict events in international relations. As an academic pursuit, realism is not tied to ideology; it does not favor any particular moral philosophy, nor does it consider ideology to be a major factor in the behavior of nations. Priorities of realists have been described as Machiavellian, single-mindedly seeking the power of one's own nation over others.

[[Sans-culottes]]

CATEGORIES: History of France, French Revolution

The sans-culottes (sɑ̃kylɔt, which means "without breeches") were the lower classes in late 18th century France. Lots of sans-culottes became radical supporters and fighters for the French Revolution. This was because of their poor quality of life under the Ancien Régime.  The word sans-culotte, which is the opposite of aristocrat, was said for the first time on 28 February 1791 by officer Jean-Bernard Gauthier de Murnan in a bad way. He was talking about a "sans-culottes army" - an army of peasants. The word became popular during the demonstrations of June 1792. 

The name, though it is about clothing, is actually a way to talk about the sans-culottes' social status. Culottes were the fashionable silk knee-breeches of the 18th-century nobility and bourgeoisie. The working class sans-culottes wore pantaloons, or trousers, instead. The sans-culottes, most of them urban labourers, were the force behind the French Revolution. The other members of the revolution thought that they were "radicals" because they wanted a direct democracy. This would mean that the people would vote on laws themselves, and that there would be no legislature. Though they had bad clothes and equipment, and got little or no support from the rich, they were most of the Revolutionary army and executed many people during the early years of the French Revolutionary Wars.

[[The Language of the Night]]

CATEGORIES: Essays, 1979 books, Books by Ursula K. Le Guin

The Language of the Night: Essays on Fantasy and Science Fiction is a collection of essays written by Ursula K. Le Guin. Susan Wood edited the book. It was first published in 1979. A new and different edition was published in 1992. The 24 essays in the book come from many sources, including journals, book introductions, and award-acceptance speeches. Le Guin was well known as a fantasy and science fiction author. But her criticism was not easy to find before this collection. The Language of the Night has Guin's most important ideas about writing.  It is about topics such as Americans' attitudes towards fantasy fiction, the strengths and weaknesses of science fiction, and how children's literature is special. She also discusses the background of her major works such as A Wizard of Earthsea and The Left Hand of Darkness. However, some critics complained that The Language of the Night has both more important and less important writing. The collection was nominated for a Hugo for Best Related Non-Fiction Book category in 1980. The title comes from Le Guin's description of fantasy literature. She said, "We like to think we live in daylight, but half the world is always dark; and fantasy, like poetry, speaks the language of the night."

The COVID-19 pandemic, also called the coronavirus pandemic, is a current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The outbreak started in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019. The World Health Organization (WHO) called it a pandemic on 11 March 2020. The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses gave the virus its name. As of February 19, 2021, more than 110 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in more than 188 countries and territories. More than three million people have died of COVID-19, and more than 85 million people have defeated, or recovered from the disease. 

The virus usually moves from one person to another with small drops made when coughing or sneezing. It mostly spreads when people are close to each other, which is why social distancing is encouraged. Coronavirus can also spread when people touch a surface with the virus, and then they touch their face. Common symptoms include fever, cough, and trouble breathing. The illness can worsen with pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. As of January 2021, a number of vaccines for COVID-19 have been developed, but only a few have been approved as safe for use. The first vaccine to be approved was created by Pfizer and BioNTech, followed by the Oxford / AstraZeneca  vaccine. Vaccine distribution has begun in many countries in Europe, North America, South America and Asia. The United Kingdom was the first western country to administer a COVID-19 vaccine. No antiviral medicine for COVID-19 is available. Doctors usually give patients supportive therapy instead. People can avoid spreading the virus by regularly washing their hands, covering their mouth when coughing, maintaining distance from other people, staying away from crowds, wearing medical or cloth face coverings, and being alone for people who think they are infected, also known as quarantining.

The outbreak might be from a coronavirus that usually lives in bats. This infected another animal, possibly a pangolin. It then changed inside that other animal until it could infect humans. It possibly originated at a wet market, Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. A 55-year-old person from Hubei province was the first human to contract the virus on November 17, 2019. A 61-year-old man who was a regular customer at the market was the first person to die from the virus on January 11, 2020. The exact origin of the virus is still unknown since the market in Wuhan sold a variety of live wild animals in cages. Chinese tourists have spread the virus by traveling to other countries and made it a worldwide pandemic.

Racism and xenophobia against Chinese people and Asians increased during the pandemic.

In November 2020, two companies, Pfizer and Moderna, said they had finished making COVID-19 vaccines. Both are over 90% effective. Two mRNA vaccines, one by Pfizer and one by Moderna, have been tested. Both were over 90% effective. Countries began planning to give the vaccine to many people.

The United States has the most deaths from the virus. More than 600,000 Americans have died from the virus. California had the most COVID-19 cases in the country.

SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA coronavirus which causes the disease COVID-19. It used to be known as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by the World Health Organization (WHO).

The virus started the 2019–20 coronavirus outbreak. The first suspected cases were reported to the WHO on December 31, 2019.

Many early cases of this new coronavirus were linked to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, a large seafood and animal market in Wuhan, China. The virus may have come from infected animals. It is not certain that this place was the source of the pandemic.

Other scholars believe that Vikramaditya is a mythical character, since several legends about him are fantastic in nature.

"Vikramaditya" was a common title used by several Indian kings, and the Vikramaditya legends may be combined stories of different kings (particularly Chandragupta II).

[[Lineal championship]]

CATEGORIES: Sports

In combat sports where champions are decided by a challenge, the lineal championship of a weight class is a world championship title held initially by an undisputed champion and subsequently by a fighter who defeats the reigning champion in a match at that weight class. In professional boxing, the lineal champion is informally called "the man who beat the man".

Champions recognized by sanctioning bodies such as the World Boxing Association (WBA), World Boxing Council (WBC), or the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) may vacate their title voluntarily, or be stripped of the title for breaching the sanctioning body's regulations or contracts. There will thus be a breach of continuity in the list of sanctioned champions which the lineal championship is intended to prevent. However, there is no single canonical list of lineal champions at any weight class, because there is no agreed upon method of determining the starting point for each lineage and conflicting opinions on what to do when the current champion retires or moves to a different weight class, although there is agreement that any stripping of a title be discounted.

[[Kereru]]

CATEGORIES: Birds of New Zealand

The kererū (Hemiphaga novaeseelandiae) is the only type of pigeon native to New Zealand. It is very big and easy to spot, and its wings make a loud sound when it flies. It is the only still-living New Zealand bird which can eat large fruits whole, and so is important for spreading the seeds of many native trees. Kererū were an important type of food for Māori. There are much fewer kererū now than before the Europeans arrived in New Zealand, mostly because the Europeans brought meat-eating animals like cats, ferrets, stoats, possums, and rats, and cut down a lot of the forest. Because there are not many kererū any more, it is against the law to hunt them.

[[Collectivism]]

CATEGORIES: Collectivism, Political philosophy, Social sciences

Collectivism is a set of ideas and values, where the well-being of the group has a very high priority. 

The German sociologist Ferdinand Tönnies described an early model of collectivism and individualism using the terms Gemeinschaft (community) and Gesellschaft (society). Gemeinschaft relationships, in which communalism is prioritized, were thought to be characteristic of small, rural village communities. An anthropologist, Redfield (1941) echoed this notion in work contrasting folk society with urban society.

Max Weber (1930) contrasted collectivism and individualism through the lens of religion, believing that Protestants were more individualistic and self-reliant compared to Catholics, who endorsed hierarchical, interdependent relationships among people. Hofstede (1980) was highly influential in ushering in an era of cross-cultural research making comparisons along the dimension of collectivism versus individualism. Hofstede conceptualized collectivism and individualism as part of a single continuum, with each cultural construct representing an opposite pole. The author characterized individuals that endorsed a high degree of collectivism as being embedded in their social contexts and prioritizing communal goals over individual goals.

[[Draize test]]

CATEGORIES: Animal rights

The Draize test is a test, to see if a substance is toxic. John H. Draize and Jacob M. Spines first used the test in 1944. The test was first used for cosmetics, but later for other substances as well. To see if a substance is toxic, it is applied to the skin or the eye of an animal, for a given time. After the time, the substance is washed out and the effects are recorded. Very often, small animals, such as rabbits were used. After the test, the animals are observed for up to 14 days. If the test does irreversible damage to the skin or the eye, the animal is killed after the test.  Animals may be re-used for testing purposes if the product tested causes no permanent damage. Animals are typically reused after a "wash out" period during which all traces of the tested product are allowed to disperse from the test site.

The tests are controversial. They are seem as cruel and  unscientific  because of the differences between rabbit and human eyes, and the subjective nature of the visual evaluations. The FDA supports the test, stating that "to date, no single test, or battery of tests, has been accepted by the scientific community as a replacement for ... the Draize test". Because of its controversial nature, the use of the Draize test in the U.S. and Europe has declined in recent years and is sometimes modified so that anaesthetics are administered and lower doses of the test substances used. Chemicals already shown to have adverse effects in vitro are not currently used in a Draize test, thereby reducing the number and severity of tests that are carried out.

Other tests have been developed which can replace the Draize test for many applications: First there is a test that uses chicken eggs. Another test uses Spanish slugs.

[[Not Your Personal Army]]

CATEGORIES: Internet memes

Not Your Personal Army, often shortened to NYPA, is an Internet meme which serves as a catchphrase used to imply that the community a person is requesting aid from refuses to help them in any way. It is often used as a reply to site raiding threads.

The usage of the phrase begun on 7chan's now defunct invasion board, otherwise known as /i/.

Taking note of the success rate of /i/, people often requesting help from this board for their personal problems and vendettas. As these issues do not usually matter to anybody else on the board, the phrase was often used as a reply to the original poster to signify that the board refuse to provide aid to someone.

The phrase eventually spread off to other sites and chanboards, most notably 4chan (/b/ is not your personal army.) where it is now a commonly used phrase.

Somewhat ironically, it has been claimed that 4chan was a primary motivator for the creation of 7chan's /i/ board.

Eventually, the phrase was seen as a humorous catchphrase, being used in image macros where the phrase's original intent is not even implied.

A definition for "NYPA" was posted to Urban Dictionary on December 8, 2007.

Since 1946 Peronists have won 10 out of the 13 presidential elections in which they have been allowed to run. The main Peronist party is the Justicialist Party. The ideas of each president were different, but the general ideology has been described as "a vague blend of nationalism and labourism" or populism.

Juan Perón became Argentina's minister of labour after participating in the 1943 military coup and was elected president of Argentina in 1946. He introduced social programs that benefited the working class, supported labor unions, and called for additional involvement of the state in the economy. In addition he helped industrialists. Perón was very popular and gained even more admiration through his wife, Eva, who championed for the rights of migrant workers and was loved by the people. Due to rising inflation and other economic problems, the military overthrew Perón in 1955. The Peronist party was banned and it wasn't until 1973 that open elections were held again. In the 1973 election, Perón was again elected president. He died the next year and his widow, Isabel, took his place as president. Perón's death had led to disunity and the military overthrew Isabel in 1976.

Peronist Carlos Menem was president from 1989 to1999. His policies were very different from previous Peronists, he focused on privatization, free-market policies, and international relations. Peronist Néstor Kirchner was president from 2003 to 2007, and his wife Cristina Fernández de Kirchner was president from 2007 to 2015. According to the Economist, the Kirchners returned to "economic nationalism and near-autarky". The ideology of the Kirchners is known as Kirchnerism.

[[Ritual purification]]

CATEGORIES: Health, Religion

Ritual purification is the ritual prescribed by a religion by which a person is considered to be free of uncleanliness. Many religgions require that those worshipping should be in this state.Ritual purity is a state of ritual cleanliness. Ritual purification may also apply to objects and places. Ritual uncleanliness is not identical with ordinary physical impurity, such as dirt stains; nevertheless, body fluids are generally considered ritually unclean.

Most of these rituals existed long before the germ theory of disease, and figure prominently from the earliest known religious systems of the Ancient Near East. Some writers connect the rituals to taboos.

Some have seen benefits of these practices for health and preventing infections especially in areas where humans come in close contact with each other.  While these practices came before the idea of the germ theory was public in areas that use daily cleaning, the destruction of infectious agents seems to be dramatic. Others have described a 'dimension of purity' that is universal in religions that seeks to move us away from disgust, (at one extreme) and to uplift us towards purity and divinity (at the other extreme). Away from uncleanliness to purity, and away from deviant to moral behavior, (within one's cultural context).

Le Courrier was issues by a small number of Catholics. It has always had a strong focus on Catholic values. In 1892, it became a daily newspaper. In 1907, Geneva had a separation of Church and state; at that time, the number of printed copied dropped markedly. 

Until 1923, the newspaper was Christian and stood for conservative values. In that year Christan Levraz changed the focus to focus more on socal values - The newspaper was left-wing, from then on. The Catholic Church was not too happy with the left-wing orientation of the newspaper. In 1996, the Church stopped supporting Le Courrier, because it saw the journal's attitude as too close to the Biblical teachings (that is: too evangelical). Today, the newspaper collaborates with La Liberté, another Catrholic newspaper from Fribourg. In the year 2019, 7.000-8.000 copies were printed each day.

[[U.S. Route 101]]

CATEGORIES: Roads in California, Roads in Oregon, Roads in Washington, U.S. Highways

U.S. Route 101, or U.S. Highway 101, (US 101) is a north–south United States Numbered Highway that goes along the West Coast of the United States. It goes through the states of California, Oregon, and Washington. It goes alongside, and often joins onto, California State Route 1 when going through California. Unlike most other 3 digit routes in the system which are treated as spurs of their two digit parent routes, US 101 is treated as a two digit Route with a first digit of "10". The reason for this was that if the west coast highway was numbered US 91, there would be no room to establish US 93, US 95, US 97, and US 99, all of which must be west of US 91. So, they decided to call the west coast highway US 101 instead. The '10' could have been underlined so that people think that this route is a two digit route rather than a spur route of  US 1, the US Highway on the east coast.

The route starts in Los Angeles at the junction of the Interstate 5, Interstate 10, and California State Route 60. It goes west past the north side of Downtown Los Angeles towards the coast. It meets the coast near Oxnard and goes north along the coast from here. The main cities it passes through in California is Santa Maria, San Jose, San Francisco, Santa Rosa, and Eureka, California. In San Francisco, the route goes over the Golden Gate Bridge. The main cities the route passes in Oregon is North Bend, Florence, Newport, and Astoria. These cities are small, as no large cities are on Oregon's coast. It runs near to the Interstate 5, which goes through larger cities like Salem and Portland. In Washington, the main cities it passes through is Aberdeen, Forks and Port Angeles. It ends at the Interstate 5 in Olympia. The route is about 1540 in total.

The route used to be the main highway along the West Coast, but now most people use the Interstate 5 to go along the coast. The US 101 used to go south to San Diego, but the part of the US 101 between here and Los Angeles was totally replaced by the I-5 in the 1960s. When it first opened, the US 101 used small roads that had already been built. In 1933, a new highway with bridges and ramps was built so it was faster for people to use.
