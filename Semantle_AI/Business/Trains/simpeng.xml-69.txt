[[Dickinsonia]]

CATEGORIES: Ediacaran

Dickinsonia is  an early type of pre-Cambrian life.  They were very different from current organisms. They are considered to be one of the early forms of multicellular organisms.  Their bodies were shaped like discs. Based on the fossils, they were between four millimeteers an 1.4m in size. They were only a few millimetres thick.  Their body was segmented: there is a large central furrow, and smaller ones around the body of the organism. Their body was symmetric.  Mostly based on the shape and size of the fossils found, they have been classified into different species. 

The Dickinsonia species probably did not move around the ocean on their own: they used ocean currents to float around. Possibly they had a way to attach to the ocean floor.  Their feeding probably resembled that of the  placozoa.

Goniatites are a type of ammonite. They are cephalopods from the Order Goniatitida. They evolved from earlier forms in the Middle Devonian some 390 million years ago.

All goniatites had an external shell like other ammonites. It was divided internally into chambers filled with gas, giving it buoyancy. An open chamber at the front of the shell was where the animal lived. It drew in and expelled water through a ventral spout called a siphuncle. They had a head with two well developed eyes, and arms (or tentacles). They were free-swimming. 

Almost any fossil-bearing limestone or shale from inland seas of the late Paleozoic tropics or subtropics is likely to contain some goniatites.

The Weinstein effect is a trend in which men and women come forward to accuse other famous or powerful men and women of sexual abuse, harassment or misconduct. The term Weinstein effect came into use in October 2017. That's when media outlets began reporting on alleged sexual abuse against movie producer Harvey Weinstein.

The effect gave rise to the Me Too movement. That movement encourages people to share any experience of sexual harassment or sexual assault. The two events caused a cascade of allegations. The allegations brought about a fast removal of many men and women in positions of power in the United States.

As a result, many notable figures were accused of sexual harassment/abuse such as Kevin Spacey, Charlie Rose, Louis C.K., Dustin Hoffman, Matt Lauer, U.S. Representative John Conyers, United States Senator Al Franken, former Senate candidate Roy Moore, Les Moonves, Garrison Keillor, Welsh MP Carl Sargeant, Asia Argento and U.S. Associate Justice-nominee Brett Kavanaugh.

"Louie Louie" is a rhythm and blues song written by Richard Berry in 1955 and best known for the 1963 hit version by The Kingsmen. It is a rock standard. "Louie Louie" tells, in simple verse–chorus form, the first-person story of a Jamaican sailor returning to the island to see his lady love.

The Kingsmen's cover recording was the subject of an FBI investigation about the supposed but nonexistent obscenity of the lyrics, an investigation that ended without prosecution.  Ironically, the recording notably includes the drummer yelling "Fuck!" after dropping his drumstick at the 0:54 mark.

While the Kingsmen's version did not top the Billboard chart, it did reach #1 on Cashbox for two weeks, and it was the last #1 before Beatlemania hit the United States with "I Want to Hold Your Hand".  The Kingsmen's version of "Louie Louie" is considered the epitome of garage rock and is often considered one of the greatest rock songs of all time.

[[Small seal script]]

CATEGORIES: Writing systems, Chinese language

Small seal script, or xiaozhuang characters, was the first set of Chinese characters that were made the standard all across China. Previously, each of the Warring States had their own Chinese characters.  People from one state did not understand the characters from another.  When the Qin dynasty (221 BC to 206 BC) conquered the other states, Emperor Qin Shi Huang forced all Imperial China to use Qin characters and Qin units of measurement.  This allowed people all across China to communicate with each other without confusion.

Since the strokes used to write small seal script characters were very long, curvy, and difficult to write quickly, officials of the Han dynasty replaced small seal script with traditional characters, which are still used today in China. However, since small seal characters look very artistic, they can still be seen in Chinese seals and calligraphy today.

[[Imperial China]]

CATEGORIES: History of China

Imperial China is a period of Chinese history. It lasted over 2,000 years. It began with Qin Shi Huang's uniting of China under the Qin dynasty in 221 BC. It ended with the overthrow of the Qing dynasty in 1911. Throughout this period, many features of Chinese civilization spread throughout all of China. These included Confucianism, standardized testing, standardized weights and counting systems, trade routes, and Chinese characters. China became known worldwide for all these features. 

Throughout this period, China had been ruled by many different dynasties, or ruling family lines. They included the Qin, Han, Sui, Tang, Song, Yuan/Mongol, Ming, and Qing/Manchu dynasties. There were also several periods where China had been ruled by several different kingdoms.

Throughout most of Imperial China, China had been ruled by emperors and empresses who were Han Chinese. However, there were some dynasties where the ruling class was made of Chinese minority groups, such as the Yuan and Qing dynasties. They were ruled by the Mongols and Manchus in that same order.

[[Standardized test]]

CATEGORIES: Education, Psychology, Tests

A standardized test is a test that is done and scored in a consistent, or "standard", manner. Standardized tests are designed so that everything about them are standard. They are administered and scored in a predetermined, standard manner.

Often they are used as a test to join an institution or gain a license of some sort. The grading system is the same no matter where they are taken. They can be used for university entry, like the SAT and ACT in the United States or the Gaokao in the People's Republic of China (PRC). They can be used a requirement to get a job, like the LSAT for lawyers.

In the United States the term is often used for the multiple-choice questions used in the educational system. They are thought by some to be a poor way to measure educational progress. They are, however, convenient and cheap. Marking does not require expertise in the subject-matter.

Many psychological tests are designed to be standardized. They are designed to be "an objective and standardized measure of a sample of behavior".

The first known standardized test was in Imperial China, when Empress Wu allowed anyone who passed the test to be a government official based on their merit rather than birthright, meaning that people work to become leaders rather than being born into leadership. However, we do not know the details of this system.

Hurricane Michael was an Atlantic tropical cyclone. The storm threatened Cuba, northwestern Florida, Georgia and southern Alabama. Michael was the 13th named storm, seventh hurricane, and the second major hurricane of the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season. It was the first Category 5 hurricane and the strongest on record to impact the Florida Panhandle, and was the fourth-strongest landfalling hurricane in the United States in terms of wind speed. As Michael became a Category 5 hurricane, the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season became a third consecutive season to feature at least one Category 5 hurricane since Matthew in 2016 and Irma in 2017; this also makes Michael the third straight "M" name to feature as a Category 5 hurricane since Matthew in 2016 and Maria in 2017 as well.

The storm passed near western Cuba on October 7-8.

The storm led to six deaths in Honduras, four in Nicaragua and three in El Salvador.

Michael became a major hurricane on Tuesday, October 9, 2018.

The storm struck near Mexico Beach, Florida in the Florida Panhandle as a borderline Category 5 hurricane, which makes it the first tropical cyclone to make landfall in the United States as a Category 5 hurricane since Hurricane Andrew in 1992. It had a wind speed of 160 mph and a central pressure of 919 millibars. It was originally designated as a high-end Category 4 hurricane with wind speed of 155 mph, but from post-analysis, it was indeed a Category 5 hurricane as originally thought. It was said to be the strongest hurricane to hit Florida since Andrew in 1992 in terms of pressure which it had a central pressure of 922 millibars. It was also the strongest hurricane to hit the United States in terms of pressure since Hurricane Camille in  1969, which had a pressure of 900 millibars.

[[Nomogram]]

CATEGORIES: Engineering, Mathematical tools

A nomogram  or alignment chart or abaque, is a graph for calculation. It is a two-dimensional diagram which gives a computation of a mathematical function. 

The field of nomography was invented in 1884 by the French engineer Philbert Maurice d’Ocagne (18621938). It was used for many years to provide engineers with fast graphical calculations of complicated formulas. Nomograms use a parallel coordinate system invented by d'Ocagne rather than standard Cartesian coordinates.

A nomogram consists of a set of n scales, one for each variable in an equation. Knowing the values of n-1 variables, the value of the unknown variable can be found, or by fixing the values of some variables, the relationship between the unfixed ones can be studied. 

The result is got by laying a straightedge across the known values on the scales and reading the unknown value from where it crosses the scale for that variable. The virtual or drawn line created by the straightedge is called an index line or isopleth.

[[Dinosaur size]]

CATEGORIES: Dinosaurs

Dinosaur size has long been of interest to the scientific and the public. Dinosaurs show some of the most extreme variations in size of any land animal group, ranging from the tiny hummingbirds, which can weigh as little as three grams, to the extinct titanosaurs, which could weigh as much as 70.

We will never be certain of the largest and smallest dinosaurs to have existed. This is because only a tiny percentage of animals ever fossilize, and most of these remain buried in the earth. Few specimens recovered are complete skeletons, and impressions of skin and other soft tissues are rare. Rebuilding a complete skeleton by comparing the size and morphology of bones to those of similar, better-known species is an inexact art, and reconstructing the muscles and other organs of the living animal is, at best, a process of educated guesswork. Weight estimates for dinosaurs are much more variable than length estimates, because estimating length for extinct animals is much more easily done from a skeleton than estimating weight. Estimating weight is most easily done with the laser scan skeleton technique that puts a "virtual" skin over it, but even this is only an estimate.

Current evidence suggests that dinosaur average size varied through the Triassic, early Jurassic, late Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. Predatory theropod dinosaurs, which occupied most terrestrial carnivore niches during the Mesozoic, most often fall into the 100- to 1,000-kilogram (220 to 2,200 lb) category when sorted by estimated weight into categories based on order of magnitude. In comparison, recent predatory carnivore mammals peak in the 10- to 100-kilogram (22 to 220 lb) category. The mode of Mesozoic dinosaur body masses is between one and ten metric tonnes. This contrasts sharply with the size of Cenozoic mammals, estimated by the National Museum of Natural History as about 2.

[[Habeas Corpus Suspension Act (1863)]]

CATEGORIES: United States federal legislation

Lincoln's suspension of the Writ of Habeas Corpus.

Since the end of the Civil War, historians have constantly reviewed Abraham Lincoln's suspension of the writ of habeas corpus. Habeas corpus is stated in Article 1, Section 9 of the constitution as follows: "the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in cases of rebellion and invasion the public safety may require it...", and is sometimes referred to in short as "the suspension clause." 

The writ in essence requires that when arrested, a person has the right to be brought before a court or governmental judge to determine that there is a means to secure a person's release unless there are lawful grounds presented by the arresting authorities to justify detention of the accused.

Lincoln's suspension of habeas corpus during the Civil War has been studied by historians from the time of the civil war and has not ceased until today with the subject of constitutional validity of the suspension. More specifically, the question of whether the power of suspension rests with the President or with Congress.

[[Lynching in the United States]]

CATEGORIES: African-American history, Lynching, History of the United States

Lynching is murder, usually by hanging, used by a group of people as a form of punishment. In the United States, lynchings rose in number after the American Civil War in the early-to-mid 1860s.

Although lynchings went down in the 1920s, they have continued into the 21st century.August 2020

Most lynchings were of African American men in the South. But women were also lynched. 92 women were lynched in the United States between 1882 and 1927. Also, white lynchings of blacks happened in the Midwest and Border States. There were also lynchings of Native Americans, Hispanics and Asian Americans in the West, including California. Even white people were occasionally lynched. 

According to the Tuskegee Institute, 4,743 people were lynched between 1882 and 1968 in the United States. This includes 3,446 African Americans and 1,297 whites. More than 73 percent of lynchings after the Civil War occurred in the Southern states. According to the Equal Justice Initiative, 4,084 African-Americans were lynched between 1877 and 1950 in the South. Whites lynched blacks to defend white supremacy. Blacks were lynched for violating social norms, including segregation (the separation of whites and blacks), and the lower status of blacks. White acted together to lynch an individual black person. In the Deep South, lynching was also used to scare blacks away from voting.

After the Civil War, nearly four million slaves in the South were made free. In some states and many counties, freed blacks made up over half the people there. The first Ku Klux Klan was founded in 1866 by Confederate veterans in Tennessee. Ku Klux clan groups were then founded by veterans throughout the South. They wanted to keep African Americans in fear, as they were before the war. This was when lynchings became common. In the 1890s, African American journalist and anti-lynching fighter Ida B. Wells was one of the first people to study lynching cases. She found that black lynching victims were accused of rape or attempted rape about one-third of the time. The most common accusation was murder or attempted murder. Other accusations were verbal and physical aggression, spirited business competition, and independence of mind among victims.

The stereotype of lynching is hanging. Hangings are what crowds of people saw. Hanging is also easy to photograph. But there are other methods related to lynching. They include being shot repeatedly, being burned, dragged behind cars and being forced to jump from a bridge.

In the late-1800s to early-1900s South, photographs were taken at lynchings to print. These were used in postcards and newspapers. These images usually showed an African-American lynching victim and all or part of the crowd that attended. Women and children often attended lynchings. The people who killed the victim were not identified. At one particular lynching, nearly 15,000 people were in the crowd. Often lynchings were advertised in newspapers prior to the event so photographers could attend. After the lynching, photographers would sell their pictures as-is or as postcards, sometimes costing as much as fifty cents a piece, or $9, as of 2016.

[[Anabolic steroid]]

CATEGORIES: Steroid hormones, Drugs

Anabolic steroids (anabolic-androgenic steroids) are steroidal androgenics. They include natural androgens such as testosterone and synthetic androgens.  The synthetic androgens have similar chemical structure and similar effects to testosterone.

The steroids increase protein within cells, mainly skeletal muscles. They cause the development and maintenance of male secondary sexual characteristics. They stimulate the growth of hair on the face and body.

The word anabolic, in reference to anabolism, comes from the Greek word anabole. That means: "That, which is thrown up, mound". 

Androgens (or AAS) were synthesized in the 1930s. They are now used in medicine to bring on muscle growth and appetite. They also cause male puberty. AAS can also be used to treat chronic wasting conditions such as AIDS and cancer.

Long term use of androgens can lead to or cause harmful health effects. These effects include harmful changes in cholesterol levels, acne, high blood pressure and liver damage.

Use of androgens in sports, racing and bodybuilding as performance enhancing drugs is under controversy because of their adverse effects. There is also the chance to gain unfair advantage in physical competitions. The use of androgens in sports is called doping. Their use is banned by most major sporting bodies.

[[Deep learning]]

CATEGORIES: Artificial intelligence

Deep learning (also called  deep structured learning or hierarchical learning) is a kind of machine learning, which is mostly used with certain kinds of neural networks. As with other kinds of machine-learning, learning sessions can be unsupervised, semi-supervised, or supervised. In many cases, structures are organised so that there is at least one intermediate layer (or hidden layer), between the input layer and the output layer.

Certain tasks, such as as recognizing and understanding speech, images or handwriting, is easy to do for humans. However, for a computer, these tasks are very difficult to do. In a multi-layer neural network (having more than two layers), the information processed will become more abstract with each added layer.

Deep learning models are inspired by information processing and communication patterns in biological nervous systems; they are different from the structural and functional properties of biological brains (especially the human brain) in many ways, which make them incompatible with neuroscience evidences.

[[Exonym and endonym]]

CATEGORIES: Ethnicity

An exonym is a name of a person, a people group, language, or place used by people of other places and languages. An endonym is a name that people of a certain place and language call themselves. For example, the endonym of Germany is Deutschland, because that is what Germans call their country, and Germans call themselves and their language Deutsch. On the other hand, Germany and German are its exonym because English speakers, who are not German, use those names to describe it.

This is actually very common across languages for several reasons. One reason is because the sounds for an endonym may not exist in certain languages. It would be difficult for speakers of other languages to say them, so speakers of other languages make an exonym. For example, words in Japanese cannot end in any consonant that is not an "n" sound, and for that reason, Deutsch is Doitsu in Japanese. Japanese also adds Japanese morphemes so that there is no confusion between the country, the people, and the language. The German people are Doitsujin, in which -jin means people, and the name of the German language is Doitsugo, in which -go means language. While the country, people, and language of Laos can all be called Lao in English, they are called Raosu, Rasoujin, and Raosugo in Japanese in that same order.

Another reason why a country might call another country a different name is because people from a certain country might have different ideas about those people or associate them with certain things. For example, even though Greeks call their country Hellas, their country is known around the world as Greece because the Roman Empire named the region after Magna Graecia, which were coastal areas in southern Italy that were colonized by Greeks in the early days of Rome. Germany has a very large number of exonyms, being called Allemagne in French, Niemcy in Polish, and Saksa in Finnish. This is because Germany has interacted with many other European countries and the Germans were a collection of tribes speaking similar languages until they unified into a country in the late 19th century. Even though the Dutch call themselves Nederlanders in their own language, English speakers call them Dutch (a cognate of the German word Deutsch) because the words German and Dutch used to be interchangeable until Germany unified in the 1800s. From then on, German was used to describe people from Germany, while Dutch was used to describe people from the Netherlands.

Even though in Mandarin Chinese China is called Zhōngguó, meaning the "Middle Kingdom" or the "Central States", most other countries calls it China. It is believed that the word China cam from the word Qín, in which the Qin dynasty unified China. However, there are a few exceptions. In Japanese, it is called Chūgoku, which has the same meaning as the Chinese name, except it uses the Japanese pronunciation for the Chinese characters for the name 中國 / 中国. In Korean, it is called Jungguk for the same reason. In Russian, China is called Kitay.

A third reason why a country might call another place a different name is because a language can borrow a name from another language. Even though Japan is called Nippon or Nihon in Japanese, the word passed on to Europe through many different languages, all of which were very different from Japanese. Marco Polo heard about Kublai Khan sending soldiers to Cipangu, which in Chinese characters is 日本, which means "Sun's Origin". When the Portuguese arrived in Japan in the mid-16th century, who were the first Europeans to directly trade with Japan, they called the country Japão based on an old Malay word, which was borrowed from a southern Chinese dialect. Thus, most other countries call the country Japan. A few exceptions are Chinese, which call it Rìběn based on the Mandarin pronunciation of the Chinese characters, and Korean, which call it Ilbon based on the Korean pronunciation of the Chinese characters. Also, while many countries call European cities by their endonym, including Roma, Praha, Köln, and Napoli, the English names of many European cities are noticeably different, which are called Rome, Prague, Cologne, and Naples in the same order. These names were borrowed from French. Since French was the official language of England from the Norman invasion to King Henry V, many of the cities names came into English through French.

Gang rapists tend to be younger and commit their crimes repeatedly. 

Gang rapes are more violent. The sexual and nonsexual injuries to the victim are far more severe than in rape by one person.

The United States reports a rape every 6.2 minutes. It has been estimated that 25% of all rapes in the United States are gang rapes.

A number of gang rapes happened in the United Kingdom. But authorities in the UK had not gathered data on gang rapes until 2011. An increased number of gang rapes were reported in the United Kingdom starting in 1996.

A pastel is an art colour in the form of a stick. It is made of pure powdered pigment and a 'binder' which holds it together. Pastels have been used by artists since the Renaissance.

The pigments used in pastels are the same as those used to produce all kinds of coloured art. The effect of pastels is closer to the natural dry pigments than that of any other process. Chalk may be added to the pastel to tone down the more vivd colours.

An artwork made using pastels is called a pastel, pastel drawing or pastel painting. As an adjective the word 'pastel' means pale in colour.

[[Balikbayan box]]

CATEGORIES: Filipino culture, Postal service

April 2018  A balikbayan box (literally "repatriate box") is a corrugated box filled with items given by Filipinos overseas to their family back home. 

Most of the time the box is sent to its destination by people who work as "freight forwarders" who know a lot about shipping balikbayan boxes by sea, the boxes can be brought by Filipinos returning to the Philippines on air flights.

==History== 

The balikbayan box was invented sometime in the 1980s, in the United States because there were a lot of overseas Filipino workers in the country. The first freight forwarder to give balikbayan box services was Rico Nunga who founded REN International in Los Angeles, California in 1981.

In 1982, Ramon Ungco, a Filipino living in New York City, founded Port Jersey Shipping International. Many people think these two companies are the “pioneers” of door-to-door delivery of balikbayan boxes, which back then they had to pay import duties when the boxes got into the Philippines.

April 2018 On 30 June 1987, the President of the Philippines Corazon Aquino at that time, started Executive Order No. 206. This order changed Section 105 (f) and added a new subsection (f-1) to Republic Act No. 1937, which some people also know as the Tariff and Customs Code of the Philippines, which became law on 22 July 1957 by former president Carlos P. Garcia. 

The now-changed Section 105 of the Tariff and Customs Code of the Philippines gives duty- and tax-free privileges to balikbayan boxes taken to the Philippines by overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) in recognition of the large impact of their contribution and sacrifices outside of the Philippines as well as bringing a lot of foreign exchange annually that helped the national recovery effort at that time. 

This let tax-free entry of personal goods in the country from Filipinos overseas. People then started sending balikbayan boxes through friends and their co-workers who were going back to the Philippines.

After the September 11 attacks in the US and the passage of the Patriot Act by the US Congress, the United States Department of Homeland Security's Out-Bound Exam Team started searching balikbayan boxes.

It was so long and strict, the boxes arrived up to three weeks late at the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement inspection facility. 

This made it take longer to get a box through, from 21 days to 30 plus days. The inspections also had balikbayan boxes opened, and people were angry about pilferage and mishandling. The Philippines Bureau of Customs also did 100% inspections which caused the deliveries to arrive really late. 

The inspections had to happen because of some individuals who use balikbayan boxes to get commercial items through without paying taxes or smuggle contraband. Since balikbayan box shipping is consolidated, even one illegal item will affect all 400 or so items inside the container. The inspection was made better using high performance X-ray machines.

In 2012, these delays were made even worse since the City Of Manila decided to stop trucks from driving along the route to and from the Port of Manila, causing long delays in releasing and transporting not only balikbayan boxes but all cargoes, domestic and international. 

Most balikbayan box companies, which are based in Parañaque City close to the airport, couldn’t operate because of the truck ban until it was settled.

April 2018 The industry was scrutinized by the Philippine Senate in 2015 after lots of complaints were brought to the attention of the public through social media after the Philippine Customs Commissioner Albert Lina said that the inspectors would open the balikbayan boxes for inspection and would include more taxes.

April 2018 This caused the passage of the Customs Modernization Act, which had been waiting to be passed for years, and also had the Balikbayan Box Law added into the act, increasing the tax-exemption ceiling from PHP 500 (US$9) to PHP 150,000 (US$2,938). This included items being brought home by Filipino tourists from trips abroad, pasalubong or gifts, and returning resident shipments.

To protect consumers, the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), using its Philippine Shipper's Bureau, does regular accreditation of international freight forwarders and tells consumers not to use the services of unaccredited and incredibly cheap shipping companies.

April 2018 The Door to Door Consolidated Association of the Philippines, says there are 400,000 balikbayan boxes that get into the Philippines every month.

==Description== 

Balikbayan boxes may have things the sender thinks the recipient wants, regardless of whether the things can be bought in the Philippines, such as non-perishable food, toiletries, household items, electronics, toys, designer clothing, or things hard to find in the Philippines for cheap prices. A balikbayan box meant for airplanes is designed to follow to airline luggage restrictions and many Filipino stores sell them. Some boxes are sold with a cloth cover and side handles. Others are secured with lots of tape or rope, and so, the shippers don’t confuse it with an ordinary moving box that is lightly wrapped. The balikbayan boxes come in three standard sizes which are: 

Shipped boxes are taken straight away to the recipient, usually the family of the overseas Filipino.

==Cultural significance== 

Part of the attraction of the balikbayan box is because it is important to the economy, which allows cheaper bulk shipment of items versus sending them one at a time or in smaller boxes through postal services. The bad thing though is it takes longer to reach it’s destination by container ship, which most of the time needs several weeks, along with there being no certain delivery date. The balikbayan box is a modern version of the general Philippine practice of pasalubong, where travellers within or outside the country are culturally expected to bring home gifts to family, friends and colleagues.April 2018 The balikbayan box gives connections between family inside the Philippines and those who are abroad, and give goods to the family within the Philippines.

[[Geographical renaming]]

CATEGORIES: Geography

Geographical renaming is when a place's name gets changed. 

There can be several reasons for geographical renaming.

One such reason is countries joining together to form a new country. For example, after the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland joined together in 1701, they formed the United Kingdom. When Ireland joined in 1801, the unified country became the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.

A second reason is a country splitting apart to form new ones. For example, after Czechoslovakia split in 1992, it became two new countries, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Also, after Ireland gained independence from Britain, the region of Northern Ireland stayed in the UK. Therefore, the country's name changed from United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland to what it is today, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

A third reason could be a new government replacing or overthrowing the old one. After the Communist Party took overthrew the Russian Empire's emperor, the Tsar, and changed the country's name to the Soviet Union, the city of Saint Petersburg also changed to Leningrad. This was because the Communist Party wanted to honor its leader, Vladimir Lenin, and symbolize the Soviet Union's turning away from Russia's system of absolute monarchy, the Tsardom, that ruled before they did, since Saint Petersburg was named after Peter the Great, who was the Tsar that founded the city. When the city of New Amsterdam, founded by Dutch colonists in North America, was lost to the British Empire, it was renamed New York City after the Duke of York.

A fourth reason could be changing a place's name to replace a name given by former colonizers with the name given by native people, and many more. For example, after India gained independence from Britain, they changed the name of the city Bombay to Mumbai.

A fifth reason could be the change of standard spelling rules in the local language. When Pinyin was made the official romanization, or writing Mandarin Chinese using the Roman alphabet, in mainland China after the Chinese Communist Party took over, the spellings of many Chinese place names changed, including Peking becoming Beijing and Nanking becoming Nanjing. Even though the pronunciations of Chinese place names in Mandarin Chinese were not any different before the changing of spelling, the older spellings did not accurately show their pronunciation. Therefore, the pronunciation of Chinese place names in other languages, or their exonyms, were based on their spelling rather than the Mandarin pronunciation, which is why they sound so different from each other. In order to teach people how to correctly pronounce Mandarin Chinese, the CCP made Hanyu Pinyin the only accepted romanization in mainland China. Even though Taiwan also speaks Mandarin, the spellings of Taiwanese place names, including Taipei and Kaohsiung, is according to the older spelling rules for Chinese place names. This is because many Taiwanese do not want to use Hanyu Pinyin, even though it is the standard romanization of Mandarin Chinese worldwide, because it was created by the Communist Party of China.

[[Chinese place names]]

CATEGORIES: Chinese language

Chinese place names are the names of places in China. Since the Chinese language has not had any sort of phonetic alphabet until only about a few hundred years ago (compared to the thousands of years the Chinese characters have been used), there has been a lot of confusion on naming places in Chinese. Since Chinese characters are a logographic writing system, meaning that the writing mainly shows the words' meaning rather than its pronunciation, it can be used to write down words in many different languages. On top of all this, the Chinese language is not one unified language, but an entire branch of the Sino-Tibetan language family. Many of the Chinese languages or dialects are mutually unintelligible, which means a speaker of one language or dialect cannot understand a speaker of another unless one of them already knew the other's language or dialect. For example, Mandarin and Cantonese are both dialects of Chinese, but they are so different from each other than their speakers cannot understand the other unless at least one speaker knew both. Therefore, knowing which spoken dialect to use when writing out the name in the Roman alphabet, which is a phonetic writing system and not a logographic one, can be challenging. For example, while the name of the city is written as 北京 in Chinese, it is called Běijīng in Mandarin and Bak1 Ging1 in Cantonese.

In mainland China, most place names are in Mandarin Chinese, the country's official spoken language. Even though the sounds of Mandarin Chinese have not changed for a long time, there were many different ways to write Chinese place names in Mandarin using the Roman alphabet, or many different kinds of romanizations. This created a lot of confusion and misinformation for non-Chinese speakers on what to call Chinese place names. For example, Beijing was spelled Peking, Nanjing was called Nanking, Tianjin was spelled Tiantsin, and Qingdao was spelled Tsingtao. These many spelling systems caused confusion among non-Chinese speakers and therefore whatever name speakers of other languages called place names ended up sounding very different from Mandarin Chinese. In order to teach people how to correctly pronounce Mandarin Chinese, to mainland Chinese and non-Chinese alike, the Chinese Communist Party made Hanyu Pinyin the only accepted romanization in official use and banned all other romanizations in official use in mainland China. Peking became Beijing, Nanking became Nanjing, Tiantsin became Tianjin, and Tsingtao became Qingdao. While the pronunciation of these place names stayed the same in Mandarin, it allowed non-Chinese speakers, especially English speakers, to say Chinese place names much more accurately to their Mandarin pronunciations.

However, in the autonomous regions, places in China where certain minority groups make up a large part of the region's population, many place names changed back from Chinese to the local languages in order to represent the local languages. For example, the city of Dihua (迪化) was changed back to Urumqi, which is the name of the city in the local Uyghur language, after the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region was formed.

In Taiwan, where Mandarin Chinese is also the official language, the spelling of place names tends to be inconsistent. The names of Taiwanese cities are usually in Chinese postal romanization. This is why the cities are spelled Taipei, Kaohsiung, and Taichung instead of Taibei, Gaoxiong, and Taizhong, which is how they would be spelled in Hanyu Pinyin. This is the case because many Taiwanese dislike using Hanyu Pinyin (even though it is the standard romanization of Mandarin Chinese worldwide) because it was created by the Chinese Communist Party, which many Taiwanese do not like. While within northern Taiwanese cities most names of streets, districts, and subway stops are in Hanyu Pinyin (since Hanyu Pinyin is generally more accepted in the north), cities in southern Taiwan use many different spelling systems simply to resist using Hanyu Pinyin. In several cases, the exact same street can be spelled several different ways. For example, in Banqiao, Xinzhan Road (新站路) is spelled "Shinjann Rd." on one section and "Sin Jhan Rd." on another.

[[Chlorella]]

CATEGORIES: Algae, Plant physiology

Chlorella is a genus of single-cell green algae. It is in the division Chlorophyta. It is microscopic in size and round in shape.

Chlorella has in its body two green color substances: "chlorophyll-a" and "chlorophyll b." It uses photosynthesis, similar to plants which also have chlorophyll. It multiplies rapidly, needing only carbon dioxide, water, sunlight, and a small amount of minerals to reproduce.

Many people believe Chlorella can serve as a possible source of food and energy. This is because its photosynthesis process can, in theory, reach 8% efficiency. This is even better than that of other highly efficient crops such as sugar cane, which are already being used for food and energy.

In 1961, Melvin Calvin of the University of California received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his research on the pathways of carbon dioxide assimilation using Chlorella.

Chlorella reproduce asexually by aplanospores. A single chlorellon cell produces at least 16 non-motile aplanospores and each one of them matures into an individual unicellular alga (chlorellon) under favourable conditions. There are no any reports of sexual reproduction in Chlorella.

[[Double-layer capacitance]]

CATEGORIES: Energy, Electromagnetism

Double-layer capacitance is the storing of electrical energy by means of the electrical double layer effect.

Double layer capacitance is when an electrode and a liquid solution are touching each other, causing the charges to line up and allowing electricity to be stored there.  The double layer is created when the electrode’s surface is charged through the application of electricity. This causes oppositely charged molecules to be attracted to the surface (since opposites attract). This first layer is well attached to the electrode surface, causing it to be semi-permanent. The second layer (with opposite charge) is held by this first layer, making it less attached to the electrode than the first layer. These two layers are separated by a single atomic layer of uncharged molecules in the solution. These alternating layers of charges have the ability to store electrical energy, in a way that depends on the amount of electricity initially applied to the electrode.  Once this charge is stored in the device, the source of electricity can be removed and the circuit can still be powered from this stored electricity contained in this device, until it is used up.

The amount of electric charge stored in double-layer capacitance is linearly proportional to the applied voltage. It depends mainly on the electrode surface. The unit of capacitance is the farad.

[[Fluorescence microscope]]

CATEGORIES: Microscopes, Light

A fluorescence microscope is an optical microscope that uses fluorescence and phosphorescence to study organic or inorganic substances.  "Fluorescence microscope" means any microscope that uses fluorescence to make a picture. This applies whether it is a more simple set up or a more complicated design.

Most fluorescence microscopes, especially those used in the life sciences, are of the epifluorescence design shown in the diagram. Light of the excitation wavelength illuminates the specimen through the objective lens. The fluorescence emitted by the specimen is focused onto the detector. The dichroic beamsplitter acts as a wavelength specific filter, transmitting fluoresced light through to the eyepiece or detector, but reflecting any remaining excitation light back towards the source.

[[Firefighting]]

CATEGORIES: Fire

Firefighting is the act of trying to prevent the spread of and put out unwanted fires. The fires can be in buildings, vehicles, woodlands, and other places. A firefighter puts out fires to protect property, people and the environment.

Firefighters usually go through a lot of technical training. This includes fighting fires in buildings, cars and the woods.

One of the major hazards with firefighting is the poisonous environment made by things burning. Four major risks are smoke, oxygen deficiency, high temperatures and poisons in the air. To protect themselves from smoke, firefighters will wear a device called a breathing apparatus.

One way to put out fires is to spray them with water. The water does two things: it vaporizes when it comes in contact with fire. The water vapor leaves the fire with less oxygen, which it needs to keep burning. The other thing water does is make things cooler. That can keep the fire from burning because things will not burn if they are not hot enough.

[[Neo-Luddism]]

CATEGORIES: Protests

Neo-Luddism or new Luddism is a movement of people who are against modern technology. The word Luddite can be an offensive term to describe someone who is afraid of technology.

The movement is named after the English Luddites, who were active between 1811 and 1816. The Luddites were textile workers. They were against the new textile machinery. They believed that the machines would replace the workers over time. In response, the Luddites destroyed many of the textile machines.

Neo-Luddites are concerned about the effect technology has on the environment, people, and/or communities.

The neo-Luddite movement has connections with the anti-globalisation movement, anarcho-primitivism, and radical environmentalism.

[[Luddite]]

CATEGORIES: Social issues, Political activists

The Luddites were an early 19th century radical group which destroyed textile machinery as a form of protest. The group was protesting against the use of machinery in a "fraudulent and deceitful manner" to get around standard labour practices. They were English textile workers who took an oath to resist machinery in the textile industry. 

Luddites feared  that the time spent learning the skills of their craft would go to waste as machines would replace their role in the industry. They were largely correct but, on the other hand, the textile industry grew to be a major exporter of cloth. 

It is not quite right that Luddites protested against the machinery itself in an attempt to halt progress. However, over time, the term has come to mean one opposed to industrialisation, automation, or new technologies in general. 

The Luddite movement began in Nottingham and ended in a region-wide rebellion that lasted from 1811 to 1816. Mill and factory owners took to shooting protesters. Eventually the movement was suppressed with military force.

[[List of United States congressional districts]]

CATEGORIES: United States-related lists, United States Congress

Congressional districts in the United States are electoral divisions for electing members of the United States House of Representatives. There are now 435 voting seats in the House of Representatives. Each seat represents around 711,000 people. There have been 435 voting seats since 1913, except for a temporary increase to 437 after the admissions of Alaska and Hawaii. The total number of state members is capped by the Reapportionment Act of 1929. Also, each of the five inhabited U.S. territories and the federal district of Washington, D.C. sends a non-voting delegate to the House of Representatives.

The Bureau of the Census counts the number of people in the United States every ten years. This is called the decennial census. The numbers from the Census are used to figure out how many representavies each  state gets. This is called "apportionment". The 2012 elections were the first to be based on the congressional districts which were defined based on the 2010 United States Census.

Each state is in charge of the redistricting of districts within their state, and several states have one "at-large" division. Redistricting must take place if the number of members changes after a reapportionment, or may take place at any other time if demographics represented in a district has changed substantially. Districts may sometimes retain the same boundaries while changing their district numbers.

The following is a complete list of the 435 current congressional districts for the House of Representatives, and over 200 obsolete (no longer being used) districts, and the six current and one obsolete non-voting delegations.

[[Bloody Monday (Harvard)]]

CATEGORIES: Pages created with the Article Wizard from 2018

Bloody Monday is about an annual Harvard football tradition.

“Bloody Monday,” as it came to be known, was a tradition at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, dating back to the 1700’s. In an open field known as “the Delta,” where currently stands Memorial Hall, sophomores and freshmen would meet annually on the first Monday of the school year and engage in a free-for-all wrestling match. Sometime in the 1800’s, a ball was added and would be placed between the two groups and each would try to move across the opposing side’s goal line. This game was a precursor to the intercollegiate football that would soon after take hold of the Ivy League. In 1925, with the game well established in the college community, the Harvard Crimson paper still referred to this annual tradition as a “football match.”

Much like the first football games played at universities such as Rutgers, Harvard, Princeton, and Yale, there were not many rules, if any at all. The event always devolved into a massive fight between the competing students, with injuries, torn clothing, and even arrests being the norm. In 1903, a reporter from the New York Times noted that “black eyes and bruises were seen everywhere, and everyone received a liberal smudge of mother earth.” In what is considered the first recorded account of a Harvard football game, James C. Richmond, in 1827 wrote a poem entitled “The Battle of the Delta.”

The Freshmen’s wrath, to Sophs the direful spring

Of shins unnumbered bruised, great goddess sing;

Let fire and music in my song be mated,

Pure fire and music unsophisticated.

Through warlike crowds a devious way it wins,

And advancing shins meet advancing shins;

Across the rampart many a hero bounds;

But sing Apollo! In can sing no more,

For Mars advancing threw the dust before.

	The game that would eventually evolve from this spectacle would be no less dangerous. The early days of college football saw gruesome injuries and even deaths. However, the difference is the early Harvard tradition was less about the game, and more about the clash between students. A Harvard Police official, General Charles R Apted, described the games as the “upperclassmen gathering all the Freshman in the Yard and administering justice.” The faculty viewed the tradition as a hazing rather than a game and eventually voted to ban it from campus in 1860. As a show of protest, the students held a mock funeral for an entity they dubbed “Football Fight, um.” A report in the Harvard Crimson described it: “Sophomores appropriately garbed, held imposing funeral procession and services. A coffin was provided… and a grave was dug.”

	11 years later, in 1871, the game was brought back to Harvard University, although in a more organized form. Interest in football-like games had picked up among other Ivy League schools, including Columbia, Rutgers, Princeton and Yale. The other schools wished to establish an intercollegiate set of rules that would have more closely resembled modern soccer, but Harvard resisted, wishing to preserve the ability to pick the ball up and tackle opposing players. Harvard eventually found a school with a common style with which it could play against in McGill University of Montreal, Quebec. In 1874, the two teams met in what many consider to be one of the first games “recognized as the legitimate predecessor of modern football.”

[[Yayoi Kusama]]

CATEGORIES: 1929 births, Japanese artists, Japanese writers, Sculptors, People from Nagano Prefecture, Living people

Yayoi Kusama is a Japanese artist and writer, born on 22 March 1929. Well-known for her repeating dot patterns, her art uses a variety of media, including painting, drawing, sculpture, film, performance and immersive installation. It ranges from works on paper featuring intense semi-abstract imagery, to soft sculpture known as ‘Accumulations’, to her ‘Infinity Net’ paintings, made up of carefully repeated arcs of paint built up into large patterns.

Since 1977 Kusama has lived voluntarily in a psychiatric institution, and much of her work has been marked with obsessiveness and a desire to escape from psychological trauma. In an attempt to share her experiences, she creates installations that immerse the viewer in her obsessive vision of endless dots and nets or infinitely mirrored space.

— Biologiohy

Yayoi Kusama was born in 1929 in Matsumoto city in Nagano. She started drawing pictures with a motif of polka dots with water colorat, pastel and oil at 10 years old. She entered art university in Kyoto afterwards went to the United States of America to study art even though her parents didn’t agree with her. She did intense performances whose name were “happening” there to protest wars and her name was known from top to bottom in the U.S.A as a great performer. In 1968 her own movie won the prize of The 4th Belgian International Short Film Festival. Moreover, her exhibitions were held around the world. In 2009, she was selected as a person of culture merits which give people who are active in terms of culture. Finally The documentary movie on her was released in 2019. It received high evaluations .

—Sickness

She actually has suffered from Hallucination; her field of vision is covered with polka dots and flowers speak to her, since an early age. She has got schizophrenia, nerve sick, from childhood to now. Therefore she decided to paint to run away from the hallucination and fearness of death. Her works reflect what she really sees through her eyes.

—Art works

Her every works are expensive. The highest one is no less than 63 million. One reason, of course, is popularity and originality. Furthermore, another reason is her attitude to works. She only releases her works into auctions when she has trouble with money. She also said, “I don’t create my works just because they can make a lot of money.” That’s why her works are really expensive.

Looking at the features of her works, many polka dots are seen in her works. Identical pattern cover on painting and sculpture is her own way. We can say polka dots are her trademark. Her works don’t stop on campus. She also uses mirrors in her works to make objects seen as though they were infinity.

[[Sentientism]]

CATEGORIES: Animal rights, Ethics, Philosophical movements and positions

Sentientism is a way of thinking about what is right and wrong - an ethical philosophy.  It uses evidence of the real world and careful thinking to develop beliefs. It rejects beliefs where there is no good evidence for them. Sentientism says we should care about all sentient beings and care more about beings that are more sentient.

Sentient beings include anything that can experience good or bad things or feelings.  These include humans, most non-human animals and may eventually include artificial beings we create or intelligent aliens we meet.

People who agree with sentientism are called sentientists.  They are atheist and often humanist. They are also often vegan or vegetarian for moral reasons.

Things that are not sentient, such as plants, rivers and mountains, may be important because they affect how sentient beings feel.  However, we don't need to care about them directly because they cannot suffer or feel pleasure.

Sentientist thinking has a long history, from Jeremy Bentham's An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation through to modern philosophers such as Richard D. Ryder and Peter Singer.

Sentientism differs from Speciesism because it uses degrees of sentience, rather than species, to decide what things we should care about.

Sentientism differs from painism because it counts positive experience, as well as the ability to feel pain, in making moral decisions.

Sentientism agrees with Animalism that humans are animals so we should care about both. However, sentientism argues that we should also care about non-animal sentient beings, such as potential artificial or alien intelligences.

A spin valve is a device that consists of two metallic magnetic layers separated by a non-magnetic spacer whose electric resistance can change depending on the relative alignment of magnetization in the two magnetic layers, electrons moving through a non-magnetic material normally have random spins, so the net effect is cancelled out. When the magnetization of both the magnetic material are in the same direction or parallel, the resistance in the sandwiched layer becomes low so that the electrons in that layer have spins all aligned in one direction - either all up or all down, allowing a new way to store binary data in the form of one's (all spins up) and zeroes (all spins down).

[[Divide and conquer algorithm]]

CATEGORIES: Algorithms

The Divide and Conquer algorithm (also called the Divide and Conquer method) is a basis for many popular sorting algorithms. An algorithm is simply a series of steps to solve a problem. The general idea of divide and conquer is to take a problem and break it apart into smaller problems that are easier to solve. 

This idea can be seen in many popular algorithms. A helpful way to think of this idea, would be when a person looks through a dictionary. For example, if they are looking for the word “Dog”, and land on a page with the word “Firetruck”, the person knows that all the pages to the right of firetruck will not contain dog.  They know this because D comes before F in the alphabet. This logic allows a person to spend less time searching, because every time they arrive on a page with the wrong letter, they know that they can eliminate the pages to their right or their left. This is an example of diving a problem up into smaller pieces. If one were to apply this concept in programming, one might start with an ordered list. If they wanted to search through that list, they would start near the center of that list. Simple logic would determine if the desired element is to the right or the left of the middle element, or in some cases it may even be the middle element. From there, each time this algorithm searches, it decreases the size of the list by half. This makes searching through the list extremely efficient.

[[While loop]]

CATEGORIES: Computer science

In computer science, a while loop is a statement which is used to execute code repeatedly based on a condition. Simply, it can be thought of as a repeating if statement.  

[[For loop]]

CATEGORIES: Computer science

In computer science, a for-loop (or “for loop”) is used to run specified lines of code repeatedly. In different languages, there are different keywords to specify this statement—ways to identify a for loop—but they all do the same task. Most languages use either “for” or “do” as keywords.

A for-loop has two parts: a header, and a body of code. The body consists of a set of instructions (lines of code) that run for each repetition of the loop. The header often declares how many loops to compete, generally indicated by either a loop counter or a loop variable. For-loops are typically used when the number of repetitions are known. For-loops are similar to “while-loops”, but usually have a known number of repetitions.

Sample for-loop in Python:

for i in range(10):

print('Hello, world!')

This for loop prints outs "Hello, world!" ten times.

The name for-loop comes from the English word for, which is the direct translation of the earlier German für, used by Heinz Rutishauser, who also helped define ALGOL 58 and 60.

[[Refresh rate]]

CATEGORIES: Display technology

A refresh rate is simply the amount of images shown on a screen per second. The general specs one will see for it will be 60 Hz, or 120 Hz. It is measured in Hz which is a measurement of frequency. In this case, 60 Hz will denote that the frequency at which pictures are shown for that screen is 60 images per second. It is a common property of monitors or televisions and it will dictate the maximum frames per second (fps) that the system is able to put out. For example, having a game running at 128 fps will show no improvements if the screen it's being played on has a refresh rate of 60 Hz. In that case, the screen can't keep up with how fast the game wants to show images, so it will default at 60 fps as it's fastest speed.

As the refresh rate of a screen is increased, the amount of images shown is doubled and there are more noticeable changes in terms of picture quality. Depending on what's being displayed on the screen, the jump from 60 Hz to 120 Hz is the line between whether or not you're going to be able to see motion blur when pictures are moving too fast for the screen to handle. But commonly, most streaming services and television shows will run at a maximum of 60 Hz, so unless one plans to do extensive gaming and wants optimal visuals, having a screen with a 60 Hz refresh rate will do the trick for most cases.

DLP projectors can be bright and have a high resolution. This can make the picture look better. DLP projectors can be small so they can be moved more easily. Some DLP projectors are small enough to fit in a smartphone. Big DLP projectors are often used in movie theaters.

[[User interface design]]

CATEGORIES: Computers, Design

User interface design (UI) or user interface engineering is the design of our machines and software interface such as the interface of your computer, printer, phones, etc. It helps the user interact with the system in order to increase the user experience and enhance efficiency.

Good user interface never draws useless attention and always finish the tasks first. A good format can help the user perform right interactions and a good graphic design can help the user focus on the function in the system. During the design process, we must balance the functions and visual effects to create a stable, adaptable, and functional system for users.

Interface design is applied in many different areas such as computers, to cars, to planes. Even though most of these areas have similar human interactions, we still need special skills to accomplish the design goals. That is why designers are usually specialized in some areas than others in order to make the best efforts out of themselves.

[[5G]]

CATEGORIES: Telecommunications, Mobile phones

5G is the fifth generation network of cellular mobile communications, first launched in March of 2019.  5G uses many new technologies that make it faster than 4G.  5G currently can get between 100 Mbit/s and 2 Gbit/s depending on the frequency that is used.  It is eventually to replace 4G,

There are three main groups of frequencies used by 5G:

Lowband 5G is a type of 5G that uses low frequencies, just as 4G does. Lowband 5G has long range (meaning you can be far away from a tower or inside a building and still get signal) but slower speeds than other types of 5G. Lowband 5G is only a little bit faster than LTE. Lowband 5G usually has speeds of around 100 Mbit/s.

Midband 5G is a type of 5G that uses frequencies slightly higher than lowband 5G. It has shorter range than lowband 5G, but you can usually still get service indoors using midband 5G. Midband 5G is much faster than LTE. Midband 5G usually has speeds of 600 Mbit/s to 1 Gbit/s.

mmWave 5G is a type of 5G that uses frequencies much higher than lowband and midband. It has very short range. With mmWave, you can't get service inside buildings. Most solid objects can block mmWave. mmWave is much faster than any other type of 5G and can reach speeds of up to 2 Gbit/s currently. mmWave is considered the least practical version of 5G since the range is so short and basically anything can block it.

4G phones do not work on 5G. To use 5G, you need a phone that supports it. Most 5G phones have "5G" at the end of the phone's name.

There are concerns from conspiracy theorists that 5G might cause cancer or COVID-19. Scientists have found these theories to not be true.

Nikolai Ivanovich Yezhov (May 1, 1895 – February 4, 1940) was the leader of the Soviet secret police called NKVD. He worked for Joseph Stalin from 1936 to 1938, during the Great Purge.

He joined the Bolsheviks in April 1917, a few months before the October Revolution. He was known as a determined loyalist of Joseph Stalin, and in 1935 he wrote a paper in which he argued that political opposition must eventually lead to violence and terrorism; this became in part the ideological basis of the Purges. He became head of the NKVD in early 1937, after the dismissal of Genrikh Yagoda. Under Yezhov, the purges reached their height, with roughly half of the Soviet political and military establishment being exiled or shot, along with hundreds of thousands of others, suspected of disloyalty or wrecking.

Eventually, Stalin dismissed Yezhov from his post in November 1938, demoting him to the post of Commissar of Water Transport; less than a year later, Yezhov was arrested and put on trial for excesses committed during the Purges. In his defence, Yezhov said that he regretted only that he had not punished enough counter-revolutionaries. He was found guilty and probably executed in secret in 1940.September 2020
