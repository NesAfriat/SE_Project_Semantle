[[Ace Books]]

CATEGORIES: 1952 establishments in the United States, Science fiction books, Publishing companies of the United States

Ace Books is an American specialty publisher of science fiction and fantasy books. The company was founded in New York City in 1952 by Aaron A. Wyn and began as a genre publisher of mysteries and westerns. It soon tried other genres. Ace published its first science fiction (SF) book in 1953. This was successful, and Ace soon published more science fiction books than both mysteries and westerns. Ace became known for the tête-bêche publishing format used for many of its early books. But, it did not invent the format. Most of the early books were published in this "Ace Double" format, and Ace continued to publish books in several genres, in tête-bêche format, until 1973.

Ace, along with Ballantine Books, was one of the leading science fiction publishers for its first ten years. The death of owner A. A. Wyn in 1967 created problems for the publisher. That was delayed several years by the Ace Science Fiction Specials series, prominent in science fiction awards and nominations for novels published from 1968 to 1970. Two leading editors, Donald A. Wollheim and Terry Carr, left in 1971, and in 1972 Ace was sold to Grosset & Dunlap. Despite financial troubles, there were more successes, particularly with the third Ace Science Fiction Specials series, for which Carr came back as editor. Several sales of the company resulted in the company becoming part of Berkley Books. Ace later became an imprint of Penguin Group (USA).

Within a few years sales went down. Howard Browne, the editor, was forced to switch to science fiction not fantasy.  Browne lost interest in the magazine. The magazine often published poor-quality fiction in the mid-1950s, under Browne and his successor, Paul W. Fairman. At the end of the 1950s, Cele Goldsmith took over as editor of both Fantastic and Amazing Stories. Goldsmith helped to support the early careers of writers such as Roger Zelazny and Ursula K. Le Guin. In 1965 the magazines were sold to Sol Cohen, who hired Joseph Wrzos as editor and switched to a reprint-only policy.  This was financially successful, but brought Cohen into conflict with the newly formed Science Fiction Writers of America.  At the end of the 1960s, Ted White became editor and the reprints were stopped.

White worked hard to make the magazine successful, introducing artwork from comics artistsBut, in 1978, Cohen sold out his half of the business to his partner, Arthur Bernhard.  White resigned soon after. Elinor Mavor was the next editor, but within two years Bernhard decided to close down Fantastic. He combined it with Amazing Stories, which had always enjoyed a slightly higher circulation.

[[Early christian councils]]

CATEGORIES: Christianity

The early councils of Christian churches often set the theological boundaries of what came to be considered statements of Christian belief. The first council was in Jerusalem in 49AD. The issue which led to the meeting was the result of the work of Paul, leading people to faith in Jesus and planting churches in Asia Minor. Paul wanted the new believers and their churches to be accepted by the original church in Jerusalem and to be known in faith and fellowship as true churches. After discussion, Peter concluded that the churches and their faith should be recognized as being on equal with the believer in Jerusalem. James concluded the same and the church issued a letter affirming the same faith in both sets of churches. The letter is found in the book of Acts 15:23-29. The affirmation was to accept their biblical faith, as reported by Paul and Barnabas, and to ask them to not offend their brothers in Jerusalem.

In the history of Christianity in the West (Roman empire) there were seven ecumenical councils include the following: the First Council of Nicaea in 325, the First Council of Constantinople in 381, the Council of Ephesus in 431, the Council of Chalcedon in 451. The near Eastern churches attend the first three councils. The African and far eastern orthodox churches did not attend after Nicaea.

[[Polymorphism (materials science)]]

CATEGORIES: Materials science

In materials science, polymorphism is the ability of a solid material to exist in more than one form or crystal structure. Polymorphism can be found in any crystalline material including polymers, minerals, and metals. It is related to allotropy, which refers to chemical elements. The complete morphology of a material is described by polymorphism and other variables such as crystal habit, amorphous fraction or crystallographic defects. Polymorphism is important in fields such as pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, pigments, dyes, foods, and explosives.

Polimorphism that exists because of a difference in crystal packing is called packing polymorphism. Polymorphism can also result from the existence of different conformers of the same molecule in conformational polymorphism. In pseudopolymorphism the different crystal types are the result of hydration or solvation. This is more correctly referred to as solvomorphism as different solvates have different chemical formulas. An example of an organic polymorph is glycine, which is able to form monoclinic and hexagonal crystals. Silica is known to form many polymorphs, the most important of which are; α-quartz, β-quartz, tridymite, cristobalite, moganite, coesite, and stishovite. A classical example is the pair of minerals, calcite and aragonite, both forms of calcium carbonate.

An analogous phenomenon for amorphous materials is polyamorphism, when a substance can take on several different amorphous modifications.

[[Apatheism]]

CATEGORIES: Philosophical movements and positions, Religion

Apatheism (ˌ; a portmanteau of apathy and theism) is the attitude of apathy towards the existence or non-existence of God(s). It is more of an attitude rather than a belief, claim, or belief system.

An apatheist is someone who is not interested in accepting or rejecting any claims that gods exist or do not exist. The existence of God(s) is not rejected, but may be designated irrelevant.

Scientist and philosopher Ian von Hegner has argued that apatheism is an alternative to positions such as theism, atheism, and agnosticism, with implications that have been overlooked in modern philosophical discussions. Philosopher Trevor Hedberg has called apatheism "uncharted territory in the philosophy of religion."

Theological noncognitivism is the position that religious language – specifically, words such as "God" – and "Allah" – are not coherently defined. It is sometimes considered synonymous with ignosticism and igtheism.

One argument holds to the claim that definitions of "God" and "Allah" are irreducible, self-instituting relational,  circular. For example, a sentence stating that "God is He who created everything, apart from Himself", is seen as circular rather than an irreducible truth.

[[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland]]

CATEGORIES: History of Ireland, History of the United Kingdom

During the wars of the kingdoms, forces of the English parliament conquered Ireland, between 1649 and 1653. These forces were led by Oliver Cromwell. The event is known as Cromwellian conquest of Ireland or Cromwellian war in Ireland. Cromwell invaded Ireland with his New Model Army on behalf of England's Rump Parliament in August 1649.

After the Irish Rebellion of 1641, most of Ireland came under the control of the Irish Catholic Confederation. In early 1649, the Confederates allied with the English Royalists, who had been defeated by the Parliamentarians in the English Civil War. By May 1652, Cromwell's Parliamentarian army had defeated the Confederate and Royalist coalition in Ireland and occupied the country, ending the Irish Confederate Wars (or Eleven Years' War). However, guerrilla warfare continued for a further year. Cromwell passed a series of Penal Laws against Roman Catholics (the vast majority of the population) and confiscated large amounts of their land.

The Parliamentarian conquest was brutal, and Cromwell is still a hated figure in Ireland. The extent to which Cromwell, who was in direct command for the first year of the campaign, was responsible for the atrocities is debated to this day. Some historians argue that the actions of Cromwell were within the then-accepted rules of war, or were exaggerated or distorted by later propagandists; these claims have been challenged by others.

The impact of the war on the Irish population was unquestionably severe, although there is no consensus as to the magnitude of the loss of life. The war resulted in famine, which was worsened by an outbreak of bubonic plague. Estimates of the drop in the Irish population resulting from the Parliamentarian campaign range from 15 to 41 percent. The Parliamentarians also transported about 50,000 people as indentured labourers. Some estimates cover population losses over the course of the Conquest Period (1649–52) only, while others cover the period of the Conquest to 1653 and the period of the Cromwellian Settlement from August 1652 to 1659 together.

Rudolf Anderson Jr. was the only person killed by enemy fire during the Cuban Missile Crisis.

Anderson died when his U-2 spy aircraft was shot down over Cuba.

On October 27, Anderson took off in a U-2F (AF Serial Number 56-6676, former CIA Article 343) from a forward operating location at McCoy Air Force Base in Orlando, Florida. A few hours into his mission, he was shot down by a Soviet-supplied S-75 Dvina (NATO designation SA-2 Guideline) surface-to-air missile near Banes, Cuba. "The loss of the U-2 over Banes was probably caused by intercept by an SA-2 from the Banes site, or pilot hypoxia, with the former appearing more likely on the basis of present information," stated a CIA document dated 0200 hrs, October 28, 1962. Anderson was killed when shrapnel from the exploding proximity warhead punctured his pressure suit, causing it to decompress at high altitude.

[[Kingdom of Aksum]]

CATEGORIES: History of Africa

The Kingdom of Aksum (መንግስቲ ኣኽሱም), also known as the Kingdom of Axum or the Aksumite Empire, was an ancient kingdom centered in what is now Eritrea and the Tigray Region of northern Ethiopia. Axumite Emperors were powerful sovereigns, styling themselves King of kings, king of Aksum, Himyar, Raydan, Saba, Salhen, Tsiyamo, Beja and of Kush.

Ruled by the Aksumites, it existed from approximately 80 BC to AD 825. It was centered in the city of Axum and grew from the proto-Aksumite Iron Age period around the 4th century BC. It became important  by the 1st century AD. 

Aksum became a major player on the commercial route between the Roman Empire and Ancient India. The Aksumite rulers made trade easier by minting their own Aksumite currency. The state also assumed  its hegemony over the declining Kingdom of Kush. It also regularly entered the politics of the kingdoms on the Arabian Peninsula and eventually extended its rule over the region with the conquest of the Himyarite Kingdom. The Manichaei prophet Mani (died 274 AD) regarded Axum as one of the four great powers of his time; the others were Persia, Rome, and China. 

The Aksumites built monumental stelae, which served a religious purpose in pre-Christian times. One of these granite columns is the largest such structure in the world, at 90 feet. Under Ezana (fl. 320–360) Aksum adopted Christianity. In the 7th century, early Muslims from Mecca sought refuge from Quraysh persecution by travelling to the kingdom, a journey known in Islamic history as the First Hijra.

The kingdom's ancient capital, also called Axum, is now a town in Tigray Region (northern Ethiopia). The Kingdom used the name "Ethiopia" as early as the 4th century. Tradition claims Axum as the alleged resting place of the Ark of the Covenant and the purported home of the Queen of Sheba.

[[Early world maps]]

CATEGORIES: Cartography, Cartographers

The earliest known world maps are from the 6th to 5th centuries BC. They show the world in a different and very simple shape.

Since Ptolemy, cartographers got better knowledge of the size of the globe.  With the Age of Discovery, the 15th to 18th centuries, world maps became increasingly accurate. Exploration of Antarctica, Australia, and the inside of Africa by western mapmakers was done in the 19th and early 20th century.

[[Pando (tree)]]

CATEGORIES: Malpighiales, Trees, Utah

Pando (Latin for "I spread out"), also known as the trembling giant, is a colony of aspen trees, in Utah. 

The trees that make up the colony are clones: they are genetically identical.  The colony is made of about 47.0000 single trees and  covers about 47. The roots of these trees are linked. A single aspen tree will not grow older than 100 to 130 years.  New trees will grow, others will die off. The whole organism may be about 80,000 years old. It is the oldest known living organism on Earth.

Humans brought mule deer into the region, which may be a threat to Pando. On the other hand, aspens are resistant to browsing: their leaves contain some unpleasant chemicals. In a study done in the 2000s, scientists analyzed aerial photographs of the region. They found that Pando has not grown in size in the last 30-40 years. Therefore they say that it may be threatened.

[[Climate sensitivity]]

CATEGORIES: Climate change

The Earth is getting warmer because people are putting greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. This is called the greenhouse effect because a greenhouse stops some of the sun's heat from escaping, and these gases stop some heat escaping from Earth. The greenhouse gas which makes the most warming is carbon dioxide (short name CO2), and burning coal is the biggest thing which puts it in the atmosphere. Climate sensitivity means how much the Earth will warm when a certain amount of CO2 is released into the atmosphere. Usually it means how much warmer the Earth would be if the atmosphere had twice as much CO2 as the year 1750, before people started burning lots of coal. Scientists think that when CO2 in the atmosphere doubles an extra 4 joules of heat gets trapped every second on every square metre on Earth, and that after a long time the Earth will be about 3 °C hotter.

[[R136c]]

CATEGORIES: Stars

R136c is a Wolf–Rayet star with a spectral type of WN5h. WN5 indicates ionized helium emissions and being stronger than the neutral helium lines. It is located in the Tarantula Nebula, it is the second most massive star in the R136 star forming region. It’s temperature is 51,000 oK.

The extreme luminosity is by the CNO process. It is 230 times the mass of the Sun and 5,623,000 times more luminous. 

The star is losing mass by stellar winds. It is strongly suspected to be a binary system, due to the hard x-ray emission of colliding wind binaries. However, the companion makes only a small part of the luminosity.

R136c is likely to end in a supernova, a hypernova, or a gamma ray burst, or no visible explosion at all and become a black hole. The fate of R136c depends on it’s mass loss.  The future of R136c is uncertain. It might become or just skip the LBV stage and become a hydrogen free (WNE or WNL)star. Lastly, it will be a wolf rayet star that is fusing oxygen (WO). Then, it will most likely to explode in a supernova.  Its remnant would be most likely a black hole.

It is a very young, highly luminous object. R136c can be seen on the lower left to the center of the R136 cluster. It was discovered in 1996 by the Radcliffe Observatory in Pretoria, Although  R136 a and b are discovered earlier.

[[Young–Laplace equation]]

CATEGORIES: Physics

In physics, the Young–Laplace equation (l) is a nonlinear partial differential equation that describes the capillary pressure difference across the interface between two static fluids, such as water and air. This difference is  due to the phenomenon of surface tension or wall tension. Wall tension can only be used for very thin walls. The Young–Laplace equation relates the pressure difference to the shape of the surface or wall. It is very important in the study of static capillary surfaces.

In physiology it is known as Laplace's law. It is used to describe the pressure inside hollow organs.

The equation is named after Thomas Young, who developed the qualitative theory of surface tension in 1805, and Pierre-Simon Laplace who completed the mathematical description in the following year. It is sometimes also called the Young–Laplace–Gauss equation: Carl Friedrich Gauss unified the work of Young and Laplace in 1830. Gauss derived both the differential equation and boundary conditions using Johann Bernoulli's virtual work principles.

[[LGBT community]]

CATEGORIES: LGBT

These communities generally celebrate pride, diversity, individuality, and sexuality. LGBT activists and sociologists see LGBT community as a counterbalance to heterosexism, homophobia, biphobia, transphobia, sexualism, and conformist pressures.

The term pride or sometimes gay pride is used to express the LGBT community's identity. The LGBT community is diverse in political affiliation. Not all people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender consider themselves part of the LGBT community.

Groups that may be considered part of the LGBT community include gay villages, LGBT rights organizations, LGBT employee groups at companies, LGBT student groups in schools and universities, and LGBT-affirming religious groups.

LGBT communities may organize themselves into, or support, movements for civil rights promoting LGBT rights in various places around the world.

[[Japanese pronouns]]

CATEGORIES: Japanese language, Pronouns

The Japanese language has a complicated system of pronouns that is based on things like the speaker's gender, relationship to the listener(s), rank in the speaker's group, how polite the speaker is trying to be, and several other things. Since there are so many different pronouns for each person (first, second, and third), and so few that can be appropriately used in every situation, many people say that Japanese lacks true pronouns.

According to the Japanese language blog Tofugu, Japanese has more first-person pronouns than any other language. To give examples of the complexity of Japanese pronouns, watashi could be considered the normal polite way of calling yourself if you are unsure of what to call yourself, but if you are male, you could call yourself boku or ore if you are with friends or family, but you should call yourself watakushi if you are talking to your boss or in a formal situation. If you are female, it is normal to call yourself watashi even in casual situations, although you can also call yourself atashi or uchi. The most common plural first-person pronoun is watashi-tachi, but in formal situations you can call yourselves ware-ware (which is also sometimes used to describe "the people Japan). This does not describe every first-person pronoun, but this explanation is written to give the reader an idea. 

Since most Japanese see the second-person (e.g. "you") pronoun as very intimate, second-person is usually avoided and the second-person is talked to using a third-person (e.g. "he/she/it/they") pronoun instead.

[[Louis XI of France]]

Louis XI (3 July 1423 – 30 August 1483), called "Louis the Prudent" (le Prudent), was King of France from 1461 to 1483. His father was Charles VII and his mother was Marie of Anjou.

Born in Bourges, France, Louis was married to Margaret Stewart, daughter of James I of Scotland.

Louis rebelled against his father in 1440 as head of the Praguerie. Despite this, he was forgiven. Louis gave him the management of an area of south-east France known as the Dauphiné. There, Louis led his own political establishment and married Charlotte of Savoy, daughter of Louis, Duke of Savoy. His father did not approve of the marriage and sent an army, but Louis fled to Burgundy, where he was hosted by Charles' biggest enemy Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy.

When Charles VII died in 1461, Louis became King of France. He earned the nicknames "the Cunning" (Middle French: le rusé) and "the Universal Spider" (Middle French: l'universelle aragne), as his enemies accused him of spinning webs of plots and conspiracies.

In 1472, the next Duke of Burgundy, Charles the Bold, fought against Louis in the Burgundian Wars. However, Louis was able to separate Charles from his English allies by signing the Treaty of Picquigny (1475) with Edward IV of England. The treaty officially ended the Hundred Years' War. With the death of Charles the Bold at the Battle of Nancy in 1477, the dynasty of the Dukes of Burgundy ended. Louis took advantage of the situation to seize numerous Burgundian territories, including Burgundy itself and Picardy.

Without direct foreign threats, Louis was able to get rid of his rebellious vassals, expand royal power, and strengthen the economic development of his country. He died on 30 August 1483, and was succeeded by his son Charles VIII.

[[Ergative-absolutive language]]

CATEGORIES: Linguistics

Ergative-absolutive languages, sometimes called ergative languages, are languages where the subject of an intransitive verb and the object of a transitive verb behave the same way in a sentence. Both behave differently to the subject of a transitive verb.

In English and other nominative languages, the agent ("doer", she in She walked the dog) of a transitive verb and the subject ("doer", she in She walked) of an intransitive verb are both in the nominative case, and the object ("done-to", dog in She walked the dog) is in the accusative case.

In an ergative language, the agent of a transitive verb is in the ergative case, while the subject of an intransitive verb and the object of a transitive verb are in the absolutive case.

Some examples of ergative-absolutive languages include Basque, Georgian, Mayan, Tibetan and the Kurdish language. 

If one sets: A = agent of a transitive verb; S = argument of an intransitive verb; O = object of a transitive verb, then we can contrast normal nominative–accusative English with a hypothetical ergative English:

Accusative English:

(S form = A form)

Hypothetical ergative English:

(S form = O form)

[[Radix point]]

CATEGORIES: Numerals, Computing

Radix point is the umbrella term for this point in all bases. The most commonly known example is the decimal point, named so for its use in base 10 notation. Similarly, "binary point" is used for base 2. In most English-speaking countries the radix point is usually a small dot (.), but this can vary as other languages can use different notation such as a comma (,) instead.

==Examples== 

Hence, we can unwrap the representation as this:

To the left of the radix point is the integer parts (made from positive powers of base 10). To the right of the radix point is the fractional parts (made from negative powers).

Joshua son of Nun is a person in the Bible. Joshua is used as a general against Amalek after Amalek attacks the Israelites. When Moses goes up to Mount Sinai to get the Torah from God, Joshua stays at the bottom of the mountain waiting for Moses to come back. He doesn't realise that the people are worshiping a Golden Calf as an idol until after Moses tells him. 

When two people named Eldad and Medad become prophets, Joshua is annoyed because he thinks only Moses should be a prophet though Moses tells Joshua that if it were up to him every Israelite would be a prophet. 

Joshua, it turns out was once named Hosea but then Moses sends him as one of Twelve spies to Canaan after first renaming him Joshua. Ten of the spies try to convince the Israelites that it would be better to go back to being slaves in Egypt than enter the Promised Land because if they tried to conquer Canaan they'd get killed. Joshua and Caleb said that if they came to the Promised Land, God would make sure they would survive against their enemies just like He had saved them from Egypt. 

When Moses dies, he, at the command of God, appoints Joshua leader of the Israelites. Joshua mourns Moses for many months after his death but then God commands Joshua to conquer Canaan. Joshua enters the Promised Land as a general kills 39 kings and manages to take over most of the country. He then divides the land among the Twelve Tribes of Israel and then dies. There is a book in the Bible named after him called the Book of Joshua.

Ishi (c. 1861 – March 25, 1916) was the last known member of the Native American Yahi people from California in the United States. The rest of the Yahi (as well as many members of their parent tribe, the Yana) were killed in the California genocide in the 19th century. Ishi lived most of his life isolated from modern American culture. In 1911, aged 50, he came out near the foothills of Lassen Peak in Northern California.

Ishi, which means "man" in the Yana language, is an adopted name. The anthropologist Alfred Kroeber gave him this name because in the Yahi culture, tradition demanded that he not speak his own name until formally introduced by another Yahi. When asked his name, he said: "I have none, because there were no people to name me," meaning that there was no other Yahi to speak his name for him.

Ishi was taken in by anthropologists at the University of California, Berkeley, who both studied him and hired him as a janitor. He lived most of his remaining five years in a university building in San Francisco. His life was shown and discussed in many films and books. A popular biography was Ishi in Two Worlds published by Theodora Kroeber in 1961.

The Lawrence blockhouses were blockhouses built in the spring of 1864 in Lawrence, Kansas. They were built provide defensive buildings in case of attack by Confederate guerrillas. On August 21, 1863, William C. Quantrill led a group of 400 guerrillas and Confederate Army to attack Lawrence. Lawrence had few defenses. Much of the town was destroyed. About 180 men and boys were killed. A militia became active by spring 1864 to prevent another attack.

Five blockhouses were built by May 1864. One militia group was assigned to stay at each blockhouse. Each blockhouse was built out of logs. They had port holes to be used to aim rifles outside. It is unknown where all the blockhouses were at. One was somewhere in west Lawrence, and two may have been far from town. One was at the intersection of Massachusetts and Winthrop streets; another was at the intersection of Massachusetts and Berkley streets.

The exact places are known for only two of the blockhouses. These are:

Both Cordley and Ridenour said some people from the militia were assigned to stay at each blockhouse every night. In late October 1864, towns in Kansas were worried when Confederate Maj. Gen. Sterling Price came close to Kansas City from the east. On October 22, three of the five Lawrence militia groups were sent to the front. This left the other two to stay at the blockhouses and guard Lawrence.

On October 23, the people of Lawrence heard that the Union army attacking Price were defeated. There was nothing that could stop the Confederates from coming to Lawrence. However, on October 23, it was learned Price's men had been hurt, and they were going south. The two militia groups continued to stay at the blockhouses for about two weeks. The other three groups were busy with following the retreating Confederates.

The nightly guard duty and the use of the blockhouses continued until the end of the Civil War. After that time, nothing more was mentioned of the blockhouses.

In 2008, Alahverdian, then known as Nicholas Rossi, was convicted of "sexual imposition" and public indecency over an incident with another student at Ohio's Sinclair Community College, where he studied in. Alahverdian requested that the trial be restarted based on new evidence from the Internet. A computer expert analyzed the new evidence in 2011. He was 90% confident that it was fake, pointing to a date error which only a human would make, not a computer. The judge refused Alahverdian's request for the trial as the new evidence was "not credible".

In 2015, Alahverdian was married for the second time; the couple ended their marriage by 2017, after a court ruled that Alahverdian was "guilty of gross neglect of duty and extreme cruelty" towards his wife.

In January 2020, Alahverdian said that he had been diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. According to his family, Alahverdian died of the disease on February 29, 2020. His wife said that Alahverdian would be cremated and that Alahverdian's remains would be scattered at sea. Upon Alahverdian's death, WPRI reported that he had moved out of the United States around four years earlier, with his wife saying that it was because they were not safe in the United States.

In July 2020, Rhode Island State Police looked into whether Alahverdian's reported death was real; no conclusion was reached by January 2021. The investigation occurred due to claims that Alahverdian was still alive, plus a warrant against Alahverdian as he was accused of failing to register as a sex offender in Rhode Island due to his 2008 conviction.

Just before his illness and death, Alahverdian knew that the Federal Bureau of Investigation was investigating him for fraud, said his former lawyer Jeffrey Pine. The FBI's investigation happened because his foster mother Sharon Lane claimed that he opened 22 credit cards under her husband's name, spending over $200,000 which her husband now owed. Pine was suspicious whether Alahverdian really died, because his illness and death were reported so quickly after Alahverdian learned of the FBI investigation. Lane believed that Alahverdian was still alive, because in her opinion, the obituary and memorials written about him had a writing style matching Alahverdian's.

A person claiming to be Alahverdian's widow denied that he had faked his death, but also refused to provide copies of his death certificate to the media. According to a Rhode Island pastor, he had been contacted by a person claiming to be Alahverdian's widow, who had requested the holding of a mass in tribute to Alahverdian. The pastor said that a Rhode Island policeman told him not to hold the event, and that the policeman also said that Alahverdian had faked his death, with the person claiming to be Alahverdian's widow possibly being Alahverdian himself using a "device that can change people's voices". A person claiming to be Alahverdian's widow, 'Louise', also sent an email in January 2021 to The Providence Journal, which included criticism of people who had past connections to Alahverdian, including the victim of Alahverdian's sexual offenses, the police officer who took Alahverdian's sexual offenses case, the judge who oversaw Alahverdian's sexual offenses case, and Alahverdian's former foster parents.

The Inugami (犬神) is a type of canine deity in Japanese mythology. He is described as a yōkai with the appearance of a dog, and often as a very powerful spirit whose have the power to possess a human being if he wants to, as well.

It is widely believed that, in order for an Inugami to be born, one must bury a dog in its entirety, leaving visible only the part of the neck and head. In this, while waiting for the dog's death, the person who buried it must tell him all his pains and evil deeds she has committed at some point, until he dies. When this happens, the person must then cut off the dog's head and sewe it back to the body, and thus the Inugami will arise.

Inugamis were often linked to important Japanese clans and families, and sometimes these same families were accused of having been possessed by a Kitsune (a spirit with the appearance of a fox) as well, gaining fame and power very quickly.

The Neo-Assyrian Empire was an empire in Mesopotamia during the Iron Age.

It was, according to many historians, the first real empire in history. It also pioneered many tactics such as arming themselves with iron weapons and employing advanced, effective military tactics.

After the conquests of Adad-nirari II in the 900s BC, the Neo-Assyrian Empire became the successor to the Old Assyrian Empire (2025-1378 BC) and the Middle Assyrian Empire (1365-934 BC), and dominated the Ancient Near East, the East Mediterranean, Asia Minor, the Caucasus, and parts of both the Arabian Peninsula and North Africa, conquering and lasting longer than their rivals, such as Babylonia, Elam, Persia, Urartu, Lydia, the Medes, Phrygia, the Cimmerians, Israel, Judah, Phoenicia, the Neo-Babylonian Empire, Canaan, the Kushite Empire, and Ancient Egypt.

The empire began to fall in 631 BC when Ashurbanipal died, and many civil wars, allowing Cyaxares, King of Persia and the Medes, to form an alliance with Nabopolassar, Ruler of Babylonia and the Cimmerians and invade Assyria. Assyria allied itself with Egypt, but they both fell at the Fall of Harran in 609 BC. The second Siege of Harran finally ended Assyria. However, even today there are still Assyrian people living in Iran, Iraq, and elsewhere.

[[Triacylglyceride]]

CATEGORIES: Lipids

A triacylglyceride (also called TAG, triglyceride, triglycerol, or triacylglycerol) is a type of fat or oil. Triacylglycerides are the main energy source in the body. They are stored in fat tissue called adipose tissue. Body fat in humans and animals and vegetable oil contain triglycerides. Triglycerides are found in the blood and in fat cells. 

Triglycerides are made of three fatty acids connected to a glycerol. The long, repeating chain of carbons and hydrogens at the end of the fatty acid, called the fatty acid "tail", makes the molecule hydrophobic, meaning it does not mix with water. These hydrophobic tails are why oil and water do not mix. The longer the fatty acid tail length, the more energy the triglyceride has.   

There are two main types of triglycerides, saturated and unsaturated fats. Saturated fats have carbon atoms that have the maximum number of hydrogen atoms possible. Saturated fats have a higher melting point and are usually solid at room temperature. Unsaturated fats have a least one carbon-carbon double bond, so there are not as many hydrogen atoms on the carbons. Unsaturated fats have a lower melting point and are usually liquid at room temperature. Oils are usually unsaturated fats. Saturated fats give the body more energy than unsaturated fats. 

To use the energy stored in the triglyceride, our body breaks down the triglycerides into smaller molecules, called Acetyl-CoA (acetyl coenzyme A). Acetyl-CoA is further broken down in an energy producing process called the Krebs cycle. The Kreb cycle is the same process that gives us energy from the carbohydrates, like bread and sugar, we eat.

[[Thai script]]

CATEGORIES: Writing systems, Alphabets, Thai language

The Thai script is the writing system used to write the Thai language. It is an abugida and brahmic script, which means that vowel markings must be attached to a consonant letter. The consonants are always written in order from left to right, but vowels have rules where it must be written to the left, right, top, or bottom of the first consonant in each syllable.

An example of this will use the Thai consonant ก to show where the following vowel must be written.

Spaces are not used to set words apart, but sentences and clauses. Punctuation markers are not normally used. For example, the sentence "I like to eat fried rice, but she likes to eat pad thai" would be written in Thai as ฉันชอบกินข้าวผัด แต่เธอชอบกินผัดไทย. If one were to place spaces in between each word (which Thai does not do), it would be written as ฉัน ชอบ กิน ข้าว ผัด แต่ เธอ ชอบ กิน ผัด ไทย.

The 2020 stock market crash is a global stock market crash that began on 20 February 2020 during the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 Index, and the NASDAQ-100 all fell into short-term decline on 27 February during one of the worst trading weeks since the financial crisis of 2007–08. 

Markets over the following week (2–6 March) became extremely bad, with swings of 3% or more being made per daily session (except for 6 March). On 9 March, all three Wall Street indices fell more than 7% and most global markets reported severe losses, due to the response of the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic and the Russia–Saudi Arabia oil price war. 

This became known as Black Monday, and at the time was the worst drop since the Great Recession in 2008.

Three days after Black Monday there was another drop, Black Thursday, where stocks across Europe and North America fell more than 9%.

Stock market prices across most of the world were greater than or equal to their prices before the crash before the end of 2020.

On 8 March 2020, Saudi Arabia began a price war with Russia, causing a major fall in the price of oil, with US oil prices falling by 34%, crude oil falling by 26%, and brent oil falling by 24%. 

The price war was caused by a breakup between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia over proposed oil production cuts due to the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic. Oil prices had already fallen 30% since the start of the year due to a drop in demand. 

The fall in prices was one of the causes of the global stock market crash on 9 March 2020, which became known as Black Monday.

As demand continued to fall dramatically, oil prices went down further, reaching a 17-year low on 18 March where Brent was priced at $24.72 a barrel and WTI at $20.48 a barrel.

On 30 March 2020, the price of Brent Crude fell 9% to $23 per barrel, the lowest level since November 2002.

On 20 April 2020, Oil prices reached a record low, falling into negative values, due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and the Russia–Saudi Arabia oil price war.

The 2019–20 Persian Gulf crisis, also known as the Iranian–American confrontation and the Crisis in the Gulf, is an increase of military tensions between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the United States of America in the Persian Gulf region.

The U.S. began a buildup of its military presence in the region to push away a possible planned campaign by Iran and its non-state allies to attack American forces and interests in the Persian Gulf and Iraq.

This followed a rise in political tensions between the two countries during the Trump administration, which included the withdrawal of the U.S. from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), creation of new sanctions against Iran, and the designation of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organization.

In response, Iran made the United States Central Command as a Terrorist organization.

[[Cabin fever]]

CATEGORIES: Metaphors, Phobias, Idioms

Cabin fever occurs when a person or a group of people are isolated in a space for a long time. It results in symptoms such as sleepiness, insomnia, paranoia, and the urge to go outside. It is not a disease but can lead to other issues.

Cabin fever is generally a temporary feeling of negativity, irritability, or listlessness due to being confined to a place for long periods. Not everyone ends up getting cabin fever. The feelings arise because you are stuck at home, you cannot go out, and you cannot do your regular stuff. People with more introverted personalities, for example, might be better able to stay busy and entertained when they are cooped up at home. Those who are more extroverted, on the other hand, may struggle with feelings of isolation and loneliness to a greater degree.

[[David French]]

CATEGORIES: Year of birth unknown, American lawyers, Living people

David Arthur French is an American lawyer who works for The National Review. French was once President of a group called the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education. French defended an Arab University Professor who was fired for saying "Death to Israel" on the grounds that hatred of Israel was not a good enough reason to fire someone. Then a woman named Bari Weiss made a documentary called Columbia Unbecoming accusing several professors at Columbia University of anti-Semitism. The New York Civil Liberties Union accused Weiss of being opposed to allowing Professors to have their rights to their own opinions saying that a student should only challenge a professor's opinion if the professor allows them to. Weiss then wrote to David French, President of the Foundation for Individual Rights In Education asking if this were true. French came to Weiss's defence saying that Professors were allowed to have their opinions about Israel, but that Weiss was not saying that they could not, only that students were also allowed to have their own opinions about it, that yes professors could choose what they wanted to talk about but that no students did not need their professors' permission to disagree with what they said and that yes Bari Weiss had said she was angry about every Columbia Professor in the Middle East department being against Israel but that she wasn't saying that they should be fired for that only that Columbia should hire at least some teachers who were pro-Israel and that she was not telling the government that they should force Columbia to hire at least some pro-Israel professors but she was saying that Columbia should hire more pro-Israel professors.

French is a religious Christian and a Republican. French is Pro-Life and supported George W. Bush during his wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. In 2006, French joined the US Army and fought in Iraq as an American soldier. After coming back to the US he became the lawyer for the National Review Institute and would also sometimes write for the National Review.

In 2016, David French said that didn't want Donald Trump to be the Republican candidate for President but that if he were, he'd vote for him. Also in 2016, people on the Alt-Right said that French was a traitor to his race because he had adopted a black daughter. When Trump became the Republican candidate, French said that he had changed his mind and wouldn't vote for him because he wasn't critical enough of the Alt-Right. People on the Alt-Right then tweeted pictures of David French's daughter in a gas chamber. After Trump won, French supported the effort to investigate Trump for having secretly worked with the Vladimir Putin government to get himself elected. After the investigation was over, French said it seemed very unlikely that Trump had actually done it.

French also complained about how often newspapers and television said people had been "credibly accused" of rape saying that most of the people who worked for Trump had been accused of rape without any evidence but that the media insisted that they'd been credibly accused. French also criticised the newspaper, The Atlantic for having fired Kevin Williamson, saying that the reason Williamson was fired was for being a conservative. French also criticised people for saying or implying that Ben Shapiro was Alt-Right. French also complained about people saying that Shapiro was racist on the grounds that people who hated Shapiro took things that he had said and apologised for to prove that he was racist when actually reading or watching Shapiro's books and videos would make it clear that he wasn't. French also criticised Glenn Greenwald for saying that Bari Weiss had devoted her life to trying to get professors who criticized Israel fired, saying that he knew Greenwald's statement wasn't true because he was there. French also praised Jordan Peterson saying that Peterson's book helped a lot of people realise how important the Bible was. French also said that YouTube should not have stopped Steven Crowder from making money from his videos but that the government should not stop YouTube from being able to make that choice. French said that Prager University did a lot of good work but he criticised Dennis Prager for being too pro-Trump. French said that he liked Trump's Pro-Life laws but that he believed George W. Bush did more for the Pro-Life movement. French supported Trump's decision to kill Iran's General Qassam Solemeini saying that Solemeini was an acceptable military target that it was not ,in fact, an assassination, under the law's definition.

An essay by a conservative named Sohrab Ahmari called Against David Frenchism accused David French of being a RINO (Republican in Name Only). When asked on Twitter what the most controversial opinion he had was, French said it was that superhero movies based on DC Comics were better than those in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

[[Mophun]]

CATEGORIES: Mobile phones

Mophun is a computing platform used to run portable code on embedded and mobile devices. Some phones and other devices support Mophun. Sony Ericsson phones, especially the Sony Ericsson T300 and Sony Ericsson T610, are the best known devices for running Mophun. It was designed by Synergenix Interactive. Most Mophun programs are around 50–150 kB in size.

Programs for Mophun are written in assembler in C and C++ using a well-documented and open API. A special version of GCC is used to compile programs.

Despite the API being very easy for programmers to use, Mophun has not been very popular. The main reason for this seems to be the strict approval process - the compiled program can only be run under an emulator, and Synergenix must approve the program so it can be used on a mobile device. The approved program can only be run under one IMEI number. Only developers registered and approved by Synergix can use self-certification (and through the Synergenix server), and they are only allowed to have one IMEI number. The developer must sign a sales contract with Synergenix, which then shares and approves it for end-users, so the program can be shared. Such a process disallows free programs to be created for Mophun, and also discourages many developers from developing programs for Mophun.

Fritz Haber (9 December 1868 – 29 January 1934) was a German chemist. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1918. The prize was for his invention of the Haber–Bosch process, a method used in industry to synthesise ammonia from nitrogen gas and hydrogen gas. He is also considered the "father of chemical warfare." This is because Haber spent years of work developing and making chlorine and other poisonous gases into weapons during World War I.

Haber was born in Breslau, Prussia (now Wrocław, Poland). He was Jewish.  When he was a young man, he moved to Berlin and learned to be a chemist.  He wanted to be German and became a German nationalist.

Today, people argue over whether Haber was a good man or a bad man.  He invented weapons and poisons that killed many people, but he also invented fertilizers that allowed farms to grow so much food that many humans today are not afraid of famine.

Haber figured out how to make ammonia using nitrogen and hydrogen.  This was important because ammonia can be used to make fertilizer that makes crop plants grow.  Before this, people dug nitrates out of the ground or had bird feces shipped all over the world to farmers, and the bird feces was being used up faster than the birds could replace it.  After Haber learned to make ammonia, people could make as much fertilizer as they wanted.  They said Haber had made "bread from the air."

People can also use ammonia to make explosives and poisons.  During World War I, Haber studied how to use his inventions for weapons.  Experts say Germany lasted one year long in World War I than it would have without Haber's poisons and explosives.  Haber said he did not think killing a soldier with poison gas was any worse than by letting the soldier bleed to death.  During World War I, Haber's first wife killed herself.

When Hitler took over Germany in 1933, his Nazi party made laws that took freedom and property away from Jews.  Haber left Germany in 1934.  On 29 January 1934, he died of a heart attack in Basel, Switzerland. He was 64. a

After Haber's death, the Nazis would use one of his inventions, a pesticide called Zyklon-B to kill Jews and captured Allied nationals in the Holocaust.
