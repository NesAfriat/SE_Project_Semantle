[[The Championships, Wimbledon]]

CATEGORIES: 1877 establishments in England, Sport in London, Tennis tournaments

The Wimbledon Championships is one of the four Grand Slam tennis tournaments. It is played in Wimbledon, a suburb of London in England, Great Britain. The Championships are unique because they are the only Grand Slam played on a grass court. Wimbledon is the third tennis grand slam of the year and is widely seen as the biggest event on the sport's calendar.

Wimbledon was first competed in 1877. The women's single and the mens doubles events began seven years later in 1884. It has always been played during the summer. It is played over two weeks, from late June to the beginning of July. The tournament is played after the French Open and before the U.S. Open. In 1968, the championships were opened up to both professionals and amateurs for the first time, with Rod Laver and Billie Jean King winning their respective singles titles.

The winners in 2016 were Andy Murray and Serena Williams.

desc top-left

The U.S. state of Alabama has sixty-seven counties. The oldest is Washington County (created June 4, 1800) and the youngest is Houston County (created February 9, 1903).

Alabama was claimed by Spain, as Spanish Florida, and by England, as the Province of Carolina. The first permanent colony was made by the French on the banks of the Mobile River in 1702.

After the American Revolutionary War, West Florida south of the 31st parallel became a part of Spain while most of the rest was put in the Mississippi Territory. The territorial assembly established some of the earliest county divisions which have survived to the present. In 1817 the western part of the territory became the State of Mississippi and the remainder the Alabama Territory. The Alabama territorial legislature made some more counties.

Alabama became the 22nd state of the United States in 1819. The Alabama state legislature made more counties from former Indian lands as the Indian Removal Act took effect and settlers populated different areas of Alabama.

In 1820, Alabama had 29 counties. By 1830 there were 36, with Indians still occupying land in northeast and far western Alabama. By 1840, 49 counties had been created; 52 by 1850; 65 by 1870; and the present 67 counties by 1903.

According to 2006 U.S. Census estimates, the average population of Alabama's sixty-seven counties was 68,642, while Jefferson County had the most people (656,700), and Greene County (9,374) had the least. The average land area is 757. The largest county is Baldwin (1596), and the smallest is Etowah (535).

The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code, which is used by the United States government to uniquely identify counties, is provided with each entry. (In this system, St. Clair County is alphabetized ahead of Shelby County.) The FIPS code links in the table point to U.S. Census "quick facts" pages for each county.

Pompeii was a Roman city. Now it is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

On 24 October, 79 AD, a volcano called Mount Vesuvius erupted and destroyed the city and its people, killing 2,000 of them. 

Pompeii is now considered one of the world's most important historical sites because of the way the volcanic ash preserved the city and its people. This gives historians and archaeologists a vivid picture of life in the Roman Empire around 2,000 years ago.

Archaeologists have found graffiti written by the people who lived in the town.

People often wrote on walls, and archaeologists have been able to read some of what they wrote. Pompeii is an interesting attraction for tourists from around the world and is visited by 2.5 million people every year.

[[Cross section (geometry)]]

CATEGORIES: Geometry

A cross section is what one gets if one cuts an object into slices.

In geometry the correct definition of cross section is: the intersection of a body in 2-dimensional space with a line, or of a body in 3-dimensional space with a plane. 

A cross section, or section is also an orthographic projection of a 3-dimensional object from the position of a plane through the object. A floor plan is a section viewed from the top. 

[[Space (physics)]]

CATEGORIES: Physics, Philosophy of science

Space, in everyday language, is something that we all know. It is measured in the three dimensions of distance: length, width, and height.

In modern physics, space is a "boundless four-dimensional continuum" known as spacetime. Disagreement exists about whether it is an entity (something that actually exists). It may be just a relationship between entities, or part of a conceptual framework.

The standard space interval, called a metre (or meter), is defined as the distance traveled by light in a vacuum during a time interval of about 1/300,000,000 of a second.

Before Einstein's work on relativistic physics, time and space were viewed as independent dimensions. Einstein's discoveries have shown that due to relativity of motion space and time can be mathematically combined into space-time.

[[Physical object]]

CATEGORIES: Mechanics, Objects, Systems

In physics, a physical object (or body) is a collection of masses, which you look at as one object only. It applies to both living and non-living things.

A human's and animal's physical body is made up of organs and tissues. It is a part of a total living being, and might  include its behaviour and way of thinking.

The point of the term is to include those systems which are separate in one sense. but connected in another sense. A galaxy has many different parts, but can be treated as a whole for some purposes. Likewise, a group of galaxies can be treated as one gravitationally. The Solar System is another example.

In general language it is usual for "object" to mean a physical boundary , but a "system" to mean a group of connected objects. 

[[Body (disambiguation)]]

[[Proprioception]]

CATEGORIES: Sensory system

Proprioception is the sense that people have of knowing where the parts of their body are.  It is also called kinesthetic sense.

[[Permutation]]

CATEGORIES: Mathematics

A permutation is a single way of arranging a group of objects.  It is useful in mathematics.   

A permutation can be changed into another permutation by simply switching two or more of the objects. For example, the way four people can sit in a car is a permutation. If some of them chose different seats, then it would be a different permutation.

[[Lipid]]

CATEGORIES: Biochemistry, Lipids, Chemistry

A lipid is a type of organic molecule found in living things. It is oily or waxy. Fats are made from lipid molecules. Sources of lipid can be found in algae, seeds, meat, cheese, butter and fish. Lipids are long chains of carbon and hydrogen molecules. Lipids are classified as simple and complex. Examples of complex molecules could be steroids or phospholipids.  

A very important biological function of lipids is as lipid bilayers, the basis of many cell membranes. Another function of lipids is to serve as an energy reserve. Lipids can be hydrophobic (non-polar), or amphipatic (containing both polar and non-polar parts).

Lipids are a group of naturally occurring molecules that include fats, waxes, sterols, fat-soluble vitamins (such as vitamins A, D, E, and K), glycerides, phospholipids, and others. The main biological functions of lipids include storing energy, signalling, and acting as components of cell membranes.

[[Group theory]]

CATEGORIES: Mathematics

In mathematics and abstract algebra, group theory studies a type of algebraic structure called a group. Group theory is often used in mathematics as a starting point for the study of many algebraic structures, such as a set of numbers along with its addition and multiplication. Because group theory is also useful for studying symmetry in nature and abstract systems, it has many applications in physics and chemistry.

A consonant interval or chord is one which sounds stable and pleasant.  It could, for example, be the end of a piece of music.  For example: C and E sound well together, or the chord C, E and G (a C major chord).

A dissonant interval or chord is one which sounds unstable.  It may even sound harsh by itself.  The notes seem to clash.  It cannot be the end of the piece of music (if the music is a normal, traditional tonal piece).  It sounds as if it wants to move on to a consonant interval (this is called "resolving" onto a consonant chord).  The notes C and Fsharp together make a dissonant interval.  The chord C - Dsharp - Fsharp is a dissonant interval: it is full of tension, and it sounds as if it wants to "resolve" onto C - E - G.

Scientifically a consonant interval is one in which the two notes vibrate at frequencies which have a simple mathematical relationship, e.g. in two notes which are an octave apart the higher note vibrates exactly twice as fast.  If they are a fifth apart the top note vibrates 1 1/2 times as fast as the lower note.  The more complicated mathematically the interval, the more dissonant it will sound.

[[Politics of Germany]]

CATEGORIES: Politics of Germany, Government of Germany

Politics of Germany are based on a federal parliamentary democratic republic. The government is elected by the people in elections where everyone has an equal vote. The constitution is called the Grundgesetz. As well as setting out the rights of the people, it describes the jobs of the President, the Cabinet, the Bundestag, Bundesrat and the Courts.

The President is the head of state. The Federal Chancellor is the head of government, and of the majority group in the legislature (law making body) which is called the Bundestag. Executive power is exercised by the government. The power to make federal law is given to the government and the two parts of parliament, the Bundestag and Bundesrat. The ministers of the government are members of the parliament, and need parliamentary support to stay in power.

From 1949 to 1990, the main political parties were the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) and the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), with its "sister party", the Christian Social Union of Bavaria (CSU). After the reunification of Germany the Green Party and Alliance '90(Bündnis 90/Die Grünen) became more important and was in government between 1999 and 2005. Other important political parties after reunification have been the PDS (Party of Democratic Socialism) which was based on East Germany's Socialist Unity Party of Germany. It joined with The Left Party (Die Linkspartei or Die Linke) of western Germany. In 2007 Die Linke and WASG joined together under the leadership of Oskar Lafontaine

As Germany is a federal country, a lot of the work of government is done by the 16 states (Länder). Power is shared between the national (or federal) government and state governments. The national government cannot abolish the state governments.

[[Musical notation]]

CATEGORIES: Musical notation

Music notation or musical notation is a way of writing down music so that anyone can play it. Many systems have been used in the past to write music. Today most musicians in the Western world write musical notes on a stave: five parallel lines with four spaces in between them. However, there are many others, some of which are in use today in different cultures.

Writing music down makes it possible for a composer who makes up (composes) a piece of music to let other people know how the music is supposed to sound. That music can then be played or sung by anybody who can “read music”. If music is not written down, then people can only learn other people’s music by listening to it and trying to copy it. This is how folk music was traditionally learned.

[[Musicology]]

CATEGORIES: Music

Musicology means the study of music by a scholar.  A scholar is an academic person, often a professor or lecturer at a university.  Someone who studies musicology is a Musicologist.

Musicologists study all kinds of music.  They study the history of music and learn about all the composers and how they developed their ideas and learned from one another.  They can do this by studying music scores, or by looking for historical documents which tell us about musicians from the past.  Musicologists may also study the philosophy of music (thinking about what music means).  

They write articles in musical journals or books on music.  This can help us to know and understand more about the music we play or listen to.

The idols that he likes include Michael Jackson, Britney Spears, Jacky Cheung (Zhang Xue You), David Tao (Tao Zhe), and so on. The food that JJ hates most is tomatoes.

For example, his album named No.89757, published in 2005, which mainly talked about the love between a robot and a girl a thousand years from now, sold more than 1,500,000 copies in just three months. His next album, known as Cao Cao, did even better. This album sold around 2,000,000 copies in just two weeks, a miracle in the Chinese Music Industry. Whenever JJ Lin publishes an album, it almost always becomes a hit. JJ’s songs can be heard throughout China and Taiwan in various TV programs, singing competitions, and radio channels.

[[433 Eros]]

CATEGORIES: Asteroids

433 Eros is the first Near-Earth asteroid (NEA) that was found. It was named after the Greek god of love, Eros (Greek Ἔρως). It is an S-type asteroid about 13 × 13 × 33 km in size, the second-biggest near-Earth asteroid (NEA) after 1036 Ganymed. It belongs to the Amors. It is the first asteroid that was known to cross inside the orbit of Mars. Eros is one of the few NEAs bigger than 10 km across. It is thought to be bigger than the asteroid that made the Chicxulub crater in the Yucatán and probably caused the extinction of the dinosaurs.

On January 31, 2012, Eros passed close to Earth at 0.1787 astronomical units (16.6 million miles).  This is about 700 times farther from the Earth than the moon is.  It had brightness of +8.1 visual magnitude.

During rare oppositions, every 81 years, such as in 1975 and 2056, Eros will be directly away from the sun, as seen from Earth.  Then, Eros can reach a magnitude of +7.1, which is brighter than Neptune and brighter than any main belt asteroid except 4 Vesta (and sometimes 2 Pallas and 7 Iris).  At opposition, the asteroid actually appears to stop in place when compared to stars in the sky. Unlike most objects in the solar system, it never appears to be retrograde (back-track across the sky).

Eros was visited by the NEAR Shoemaker probe, which orbited it, taking many pictures of its surface.  On February 12, 2001, at the end of its mission, NEAR landed on the asteroid's surface using its maneuvering jets.

Objects in an orbit like Eros can exist for only a few hundred million years before the orbit is changed by the effects of gravity. Simulations suggest that Eros may evolve into an Earth-crosser within 2 million years (Michel et al., 1996).

The adjectival form which is not used a lot of the name Eros is Erotian.

[[Thelema]]

CATEGORIES: New religious movements, Occult

Thelema is the English spelling of the Greek noun θέλημα: "will", from the verb θέλω: to will, wish, purpose. Early Christian writings use the word to refer to the will of God, the human will, and even the will of God's opponent, the Devil.

Thelema is also a way of life first written about by François Rabelais (16th century) in his famous books of fiction, Gargantua and Pantagruel. The core of this way of life was summed up in the phrase "Do what thou wilt" ("fay çe que vouldras"  in the original old French). This idea was later put into practice in the mid 18th century by Sir Francis Dashwood at Medmenham.

This Thelemic Law of Rabelais was revived by Aleister Crowley in 1904 when Crowley wrote The Book of the Law. This book contains both the word Thelema in Greek as well as the phrase "Do what thou wilt." From this, Crowley took Thelema as the name of his own religion. Thus Shri Gurudev Mahendranath wrote that Rabelais, Dashwood, and Crowley must share the honor of perpetuating Thelema.

[[Wave–particle duality]]

CATEGORIES: Quantum mechanics

Wave–particle duality is perhaps one of the most confusing concepts in physics, because it is so unlike anything we see in the ordinary world.

Physicists who studied light in the 1700s and 1800s had an argument about whether light was made of particles or waves. Light seems to act like both. At times, light seems to go only in a straight line, as if it were made of particles.  But other experiments show that light has a frequency and wavelength, just like a sound wave or water wave.  Until the 20th century, most physicists thought that light was either one or the other, and that the scientists on the other side of the argument were simply wrong.

[[Western Roman Empire]]

CATEGORIES: Places of Ancient Rome, Roman Empire

The Western Roman Empire was the western half of the Roman Empire, from its division by Diocletian in 286 AD. The other half of the Roman Empire became known as the Eastern Roman Empire, later known as the Byzantine Empire.

The whole Roman Empire had been in difficulties since 190 AD when large Gothic tribes began moving into areas under Roman control. The leadership of Rome was weak and there was instability. Various power groups in the Roman armies kept trying to install their own Emperors, and murdering Emperors who belonged to other groups. This meant the invasions by the Germanic tribes were not successfully stopped.

The Emperor Diocletian tried to bring stability back into government by dividing the Empire into sections. These became the Western Empire which included Iberia, France, Southern Britain, Italy, North Africa and parts of Germany, and the Eastern Empire which included the Balkans, Turkey, the Levant and Egypt.

Rome ceased to be the capital from the time of the division.  In 286, the capital of the Western Roman Empire became Mediolanum (modern Milan).  In 402, the capital was again moved, this time to Ravenna.

[[Social democracy]]

CATEGORIES: Socialism, Democracy, Political systems

Social democracy is a government system that has similar values to socialism, but within a capitalist framework. The ideology, named from democracy where people have a say in government actions, supports a competitive economy with money while also helping people whose jobs don't pay a lot. This makes it easier for people to support themselves in society by having more protection if they lose their jobs.  Socialism places an emphasis on equal rights for everyone, and there is plenty of government ownership or regulation of various industries that make companies play by the government's rules. This way of governing is appreciated by people living in countries who have to battle the cold more than others, like the northern Nordic countries of Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Iceland. The ideology's movement has seen some interest in other countries whose systems do not work this way, because it has worked well for those who have it. 

Despite a common belief that social democracy is socialist by principle, its policies keep capitalism in place and socialists often dislike social democrats. Social democrats support Keynesian economics, where the government should step in and help people without jobs. In social democracy entrepreneurs own the industries just like they would in a standard capitalist economy. In socialism the workers own them instead which is very different.

It was a separate borough from 1920, when it became a part of Groß-Berlin, until the borughs were changed in 2001. Then it was joined with Friedrichshain to form the new borough of Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg.

This was a law that forced all people with superhuman powers to identify them self to the government. Many superheroes believed this was a good thing and that it would save lives. Others believed it was bad. They felt that if the government knew who they were, they would be in danger of others finding out. They believed that the SRA took away many of their freedoms. This caused the superheros to split into two groups. Those supporting the SRA were led by Iron Man. Those against it were led by Captain America.

Many people have compared the story of Civil War to that of the United States after 9/11 and the Patriot Act.

The old meeting hall which seated 4,700 was replaced by a new meeting hall, with space for 6,800 people, and a tent camp with over 600 caravan spots was fixed and replaced with just as many cabins, which were rented by the members of the church.

Maintenance and development of Brunstad is still done by volunteers. During the building project and during arrangements, members are used as voluntary workers, or paid expenses. Money for the expansion project came for the most from the effort from the "A-lag" (A-team), where the church's youth from all over the world participate and do voluntarily work.

BCC is now a modern location for events and conferences. Brunstad has several restaurants, a cafeteria style restaurant, a large coffee bar, and a grocery store.

The Republic of Texas was a sovereign state in North America between the United States and Mexico that existed from 1836 to 1845. It was started on March 2 1836, when the people living in Texas declared themselves independent from Mexico. The Mexican army led by Santa Anna marched into Texas and attacked the new country. However the Mexican army was defeated and Santa Anna was captured at a battle near the site of Houston. The new republic did not have an easy time. It did not have a proper government, or any money. Its borders were often raided by Mexico, and there was fighting between the settlers and the Native Americans. The US government did not recognize the Republic of Texas.

In 1841, Santa Anna again became president of Mexico and the border attacks increased. By this time, thousands of new settlers had moved into Texas, and people in the US supported the people of Texas. The idea of annexation of Texas into the US became popular.

The Republic of Texas ended on December 29, 1845, when Texas became the 28th state of the United States of America.

[[Nestorianism]]

CATEGORIES: Ancient Christianity

Nestorianism is a movement within Christianity. The idea behind the doctrine was that there were two different persons of Jesus. One of them was the man Jesus, the other was the aspect of son of God, or Logos. Perhaps the most prominent supporter of the idea was Nestorius, archbishop of Constantinople. Nestorius lived from about 380 to about 450 AD. The Council of Ephesus condemned this view in 431. This led to a split of the church, into the Assyrian Church of the East and the Byzantine Church. 

For this reason, the Assyrian Church of the East is sometimes called Nestorian. The church holds the view that Christ has two essences (qnome) that are united in one person (parsopa).

[[Seesaw]]

CATEGORIES: Playground equipment

A seesaw (also known as a teeter-totter) is a long, narrow board which is fixed in the middle, a little way above the ground. When one end of the seesaw goes up the other goes down.

Children often like to play on seesaws. Two children sit on the seesaw, one at each end. The child who is down pushes the ground with his feet so that he goes up and his friend goes down.  Then the friend pushes up so the first child goes down. They continue to go back and forth until they are ready to stop playing on the seesaw.

It works best with two children who are about the same size, or else the heavy person will make his end stay down.  On some seesaws there is room for two or three children on each end.  There is a handle for each child to hold on to so that they do not fall off.

In mechanics (a kind of physics) anything that is balanced in the middle and goes up and down like a seesaw might be described as something that "seesaws".  

[[Playground slide]]

CATEGORIES: Playground equipment

Playground slides are slides for children to play on in playgrounds.  The child climbs up a ladder or some stairs, then sits down at the top and slides all the way down.  Some children like to slide down on their backs or on their stomachs.  This can sometimes be dangerous on big slides.

Slides are made of metal, plastic or wood.  They must have a smooth surface so that the child does not hurt himself.  Sometimes, in amusement parks, there are giant slides called "helterskelters".

There are slides at swimming pools where people can slide down into the water with a splash.  These are called "water slides" or "shutes".

[[Antipsychotic]]

Today, they are mostly used for the treatment of psychosis, as it occurs in schizophrenia and  bipolar disorder. They can also be used to treat depression and mood swings. Very strong antipsychotics can be combined with an opioid to produce a special analgesic; the patient will be conscious, but heavily sedated, and feel very little pain.

[[490 Veritas]]

CATEGORIES: Asteroids

490 Veritas is a big asteroid, which may have been involved in one of the more huge asteroid-asteroid collisions of the past 100 million years.

At 115 and 125 km in diameter, Veritas and 92 Undina are the biggest of the 300-strong Veritas family of asteroids. David Nesvorný of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder traced the orbits of these bodies back in time, and calculated that they formed in a collision of a body at least 150 km in diameter with a smaller asteroid some 8 million years ago. Veritas and Undina would have been the biggest pieces of that collision.

The thought Veritas collision would have been too far from Jupiter for the pieces to have been slung into a collision course with Earth. However, solar radiation would have caused the resulting dust to drift inward to Earth orbit over a time span consistent with the record of dust in the ocean sediment.

Today continuing collisions among Veritas-family asteroids are estimated to send five thousand tons of cosmic dust to Earth each year, 15% of the total.

It was found by Max Wolf in 1902. Its provisional name was 1902 JP.

[[Johannes Vermeer]]

CATEGORIES: 1632 births, 1675 deaths, Dutch painters, People from Delft, Johannes Vermeer

Johannes Vermeer or Jan Vermeer (baptised 31 October 1632, died 15 December 1675) was a Dutch Baroque painter. He spent his life in the town of Delft. Vermeer came from a Protestant family but he married a Catholic, named Catherina Bolnes, in April 1653. They had eleven children.

Vermeer mainly painted people in daily life. He painted people in detail and used rich colors. He kept the backgrounds simple. This contrast makes the viewer focus on the main point. 

He used perspective technique to draw lines from one dot on the canvas. He used this technique on his 17 paintings. Those paintings have a little dot which may be used for perspective. 

Vermeer’s painted women often wear blue clothes. This color blue is made from a natural mineral called lapis lazuli.

There is no self portrait of Jan Vermeer. His face may be in some other paintings, especially The Art of Painting (De Schilderkunst) and The Procuress (De Koppelaarste), but there is no proof that the man is Vermeer.

[[Classical Athens]]

CATEGORIES: Ancient Athens

Classical Athens refers to the city of Athens from  508 to 322 BC. Athenian democracy was established in 508 BC under Cleisthenes, after the tyranny of the Peistratids and the rule of Isagoras. This system remained remarkably stable, and with a few brief interruptions remained in place for 180 years, until 322 BC. Athens was one of the most powerful cities in ancient times. It was important because there democracy developed.

In 477 B.C. Athens began the Delian League to join the city-states for protection. Their rival was the Peloponnesian League led by Sparta. The Delian League's money was kept in the temple of Apollo.

In the classical period, Athens was a center for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato's Akademia and Aristotle's Lyceum. Athens was also the birthplace of Socrates, Pericles, Sophocles, and other philosophers, writers and politicians of the ancient world. It is widely referred to as the cradle of western civilization, and the birthplace of democracy. Its culture and political achievements during the 5th and 4th centuries BC had widespread effects.

The classical period is usually dealt with by its most important political events, as follows:

CATEGORIES: History of Poland, History of Russia, 1794, 1790s in Europe

The Warsaw Uprising of 1794 (also called the "Warsaw Insurrection") was started by a group of Polish people who lived in Warsaw. With help from the Polish Army, they tried to stop Russia from controlling the biggest city in Poland. It started on April 17, 1794, which was soon after Tadeusz Kościuszko's victory at an important battle.

Although the Russian army was larger, had better weapons, and killed many Polish people, Russian soldiers started to lose a lot of land and suffered from many deaths.

The Polish people had been preparing to fight in the uprising since the spring of 1793. They managed to become very popular: they formed a large army of volunteers who were led by a shoemaker, Jan Kiliński. Apart from this army, the most famous group to take part in giving the Polish people their freedom were the Poles who had been forced to join the Russian army. A person who watched the fighting was a French artist, Jan Piotr Norblin, who drew pictures of the uprising.

[[Benzaiten]]

CATEGORIES: Japanese deities

Benzaiten (弁才天, 弁財天) is the Japanese name of the goddess Saraswati. Worship of Benzaiten arrived in Japan in the 6th to 8th centuries, mainly through the Chinese translations of the Sutra of Golden Light .

Her Sanskrit name is "Sarasvatî Devî", which means "flowing water". This is why Benzaiten is the goddess of everything that flows: water, words, speech, and music. The characters used to write her name showed her as the goddess of eloquence. Because of the Sutra of Golden Light, in Japan she became a protector of the people. Lastly, she became one of the Seven Lucky Gods.

In the Rig-Veda (6.61.7) Sarasvati killed the three-headed snake, also known as Vritra. This is probably one of the sources of Sarasvati/Benzaiten's close link with snakes and dragons in Japan. She has a shrine on the Island of Enoshima in Sagami Bay, about 50 kilometers south of Tokyo; and a five-headed dragon and her are the main people in the Enoshima Engi, a history of the shrines on Enoshima written by the Japanese Buddhist monk Kokei (皇慶). According to Kokei, Benzaiten is the third daughter of the dragon-king of Munetsuchi (無熱池; literally "lake without heat"), the lake which is at the center of the world in an ancient Buddhist view.

[[Left Hand Path]]

CATEGORIES: Spirituality

Left Hand Path is a term used in occultism for one kind of spiritual path. It is the opposite of the Right Hand Path, which is what most people think of when they think of religion or spirituality.

The use of this term in occultism came from a term used in Hindu Tantra, Vama marga in Sanskrit. This ancient form of tantra used the breaking of rules (taboos) as part of the practice. Rules about diet and sex were broken on purpose. For example, rules against eating meat and drinking alcohol might be broken. Such a practice might require eating meat and drinking alcohol while having sex in a graveyard or cremation ground.

People who follow the Left Hand Path in the West are not interested in giving up pleasure or the world in order to be spiritual. They are not interested in worshiping God or following rules made up by others. They seek to gain power and freedom by breaking through taboos, fears and restrictions.

Many people link this term with Satanism and black magic, but they are not the same. The Left Hand Path is sometimes described as amoral.

John Dee (13 July 1527 – 1608 or 1609) was a well-known English mathematician, astronomer, astrologer, geographer, occultist, and consultant to Queen Elizabeth One. He also studied to alchemy, divination, and Hermetic philosophy.

Dee lived during a time when people were just learning the difference between science and magic. He was one of the most learned men of his time. He lectured to crowded halls at the University of Paris when still in his early twenties. Dee was an expert in mathematics, astronomy and navigation. He trained many of those who would go on voyages of discovery for England. In fact, he coined the term "British Empire".

At the same time, he was very interested in magic and Hermetic philosophy. He spent the last third of his life studying mostly these subjects. During his time, these subjects were not thought to be opposed to science. They were thought to be part of science.

He wrote Monas Hieroglyphica ("The Hieroglyphic Monad") in 1564 (about Kabbala and alchemy). He also wrote the preface to the first English translation of Euclid's works.

[[Marilyn (hill)]]

CATEGORIES: Hills, Mountains of the United Kingdom, Ireland

A Marilyn is a mountain or hill in the British Isles (including Ireland) with a relative height of at least 150 metres (492 ft). The name was coined as an ironic contrast to the designation Munro, that is used of a Scottish mountain with a height of more than 3,000 feet, which is homophonous with (Marilyn) Monroe.

There are currently 1554 Marilyns identified in Great Britain and surrounding islands: 1214 in Scotland, 179 in England 156 in Wales and 5 on the Isle of Man. 

Many of the largest hills are Marilyns, including Ben Nevis, Scafell Pike and Snowdon. On the other hand, many large hills, including some Munros, and other well-known hills are not Marilyns because they do not meet the relative height criterion. 

[[Munro]]

CATEGORIES: Geography of Scotland

A Munro is a Scottish mountain with a height over 3,000 feet (914.4 metres). They are named after Sir Hugh Munro (1856–1919), who produced the first attempt at a catalogue of such hills, known as Munro's Tables, in 1891.

Munro did not set any measure of relative height by which a peak qualified as a separate mountain, and much debate has since taken place over how distinct two hills must be if they are to be considered as two separate Munros.

Despite their modest height, walking and climbing in the Scottish mountains may be made dangerous by their latitude and exposure to Atlantic weather systems. Even in summer, conditions can be very bad; thick fog, strong winds, driving rain and freezing summit temperatures are not unusual.

Winter ascents of certain Munros are widely accepted to provide among the most challenging ice climbs in Europe. Some walkers are unprepared for the often extreme weather conditions on the exposed tops and many fatalities are recorded every year, often resulting from slips on wet rock or ice.

[[Topographic prominence]]

CATEGORIES: Physical geography

Topographic prominence is a way to measure the independence of a summit. It is often known simply as prominence. Some also call it autonomous height, relative height, shoulder drop (in the United States), or prime factor (in Europe). It is "the elevation difference between the summit and the lowest contour line encircling it and no higher summit".

Two related concepts in topography are col and parent peak. These are used to calculate the prominence. The parent peak is a higher mountain that is often (but not always) nearby. It is chosen using a variety of criteria. The col is the lowest point between two peaks. There may be several cols between a peak and its parent peak, since other peaks may be between the two. The highest of these cols is known as the key col. Prominence is measured as the difference in height between the summit and the key col.

[[Theremin]]

CATEGORIES: Electronic musical instruments

The Theremin ˈθɛɹəmɪn, (also thereminvox or aetherphone) is one of the first fully electronic musical instruments. It was invented by Russian inventor Léon Theremin in October 1920 after the outbreak of the Russian civil war. Its invention grew out of a search for ways to detect movement. It was the first musical instrument to be played without being touched. The control section has two metal antennae to sense the positions of the player's hands. One hand controls the pitch. The other hand controls the volume. To play the theremin, the player moves his hands around the two metal antennas. The electric signals from the theremin are amplified and sent to a loudspeaker.

The sound of the theremin is associated with "alien," surreal, and eerie-sounding portamento, glissando, tremolo, and vibrato sounds. It has been used in film soundtracks such as Spellbound, The Lost Weekend, Ed Wood, Mars Attacks! and The Day the Earth Stood Still. The BBC Radiophonic Workshop used the theramin to provide the electronic sounds in demand in the mid-century. Theremins are also used in art music (especially avant-garde and 20th century "new music") and in popular music genres such as rock and pop. The Russian Dmitri Shostakovich was one of the first to include parts for the theremin in orchestral pieces, including a use in his score for the 1931 film Odna.

While they were once strong allies, today there is a lot of political rivalry between Yushchenko and Tymoshenko.

She had been in prison for improper behaviour in court since 5 August 2011. Tymoshenko appealed against the sentence on 24 October 2011; she said the sentence was an act of revenge by Viktor Yanukovych (he has said it is not). The European Union and Russia protested against the sentence.

In reality the Dannebrog of 1219 was most likely a crusade banner - the war in 1219 was a crusade against the Estonians, who were not Christians. 

The battle took place in the 15th of June, and every year the flags birthday is celebrated in this day. 

In some countries the flag is a symbol of the state. In Denmark the Dannebrog is very much a symbol of the people, and the flag is used for all kinds off private celebrations - such as birthdays, weddings and Christmas. For Danes the Dannebrog is a sign of happiness and celebration and not of patriotism.

The coat of arms of Denmark consists of three crowned blue lions with nine red hearts, all in a golden shield.

The seal of King Canute VI of Denmark is the oldest known example of the coat of arms of Denmark. It is from around 1190.

Until around 1960 Denmark also had a large coat of arms. Both were used by the government. In 1959, the large coat of arms changed status and became the royal coat of arms - that is a coat of arms for the king and the royal family. The large coat of arms is inspired by one which was designed in 1819 and adopted by king Frederik VI.

The large coat of arms comprise symbols representing all parts of the Danish kingdom - or to be precise: only territories that are still part of the Kingdom of Denmark. In the coat of arms shown to the left the upper left part of the shield (the three lions) represents Denmark. In the lower part the three crowns (only two are visible) represents Sweden, this is for historic reasons. The polar bear represents Greenland and the ram represents the Faroe Islands. The two lions in the upper right side represents the principality of Slesvig. Until 1972, it also included other symbols representing principalities in Germany and parts of present-day Sweden that used to be ruled by the Danish king.

In 1972 when King Frederik IX died and Margrethe II became queen the coat of arms of the royal family was redesigned, and today it only comprises symbols representing the current parts of the Danish Kingdom.

Epithelia are found on the surface of organs and many other parts of the body. One main function of epithelia is moving fluids into or out of an organ or body part. It also protects organs and carries sense organs. 

There are many different types of epithelium that do different things in the body, including the excretory system. The epithelium covers blood vessels and hollow organs such as the stomach and kidneys.  All glands are made from epithelial cells. In some areas, the epithelium secretes sweat, oil, or mucus.

Functions of epithelial cells include secretion, selective absorption, protection, transcellular transport, and sensing. Epithelial layers have no blood vessels: they get oxygen and nourishment from the underlying connective tissue, through the basement membrane.

[[Pacific hurricane]]

CATEGORIES: Pacific Ocean, Hurricanes

A Pacific hurricane is a tropical cyclone that forms in the northeastern part of the Pacific Ocean. For organizational purposes, the Pacific Ocean is divided into three parts: the eastern (North America to 140°W), central (140°W to the International Date Line), and western (west of the Date Line). A Pacific hurricane, then, is a tropical cyclone in the northern Pacific Ocean east of the Date Line. Tropical cyclones that form in the western north Pacific are called typhoons. This separation between the two basins is convenient, however, as tropical cyclones rarely form in the central north Pacific and few ever cross the dateline.

[[Plain English Campaign]]

CATEGORIES: Companies of the United Kingdom, Prose

Plain English Campaign Limited (PEC) is a commercial editing and training firm based in the United Kingdom. It was started in 1979 by Chrissie Maher. The company advocates for the use of simple ("plain") English. It tries to persuade organisations in the UK and abroad to communicate with the public simply. In 1990, Plain English Campaign created the Crystal Mark, its "seal of approval." This is a symbol printed on documents which the Plain English campaign thinks are very easy to understand. According to the Plain English Campaign, the symbol appears on over 20,000 documents worldwide.

The Plain English Campaign also gives out an annual "Foot in Mouth Award" for "a baffling comment by a public figure." The name of this award comes from a humorous English idiom. If a person has their "foot in their mouth," that means they are speaking badly and not paying attention to what they are saying. The plain English Campaign also gives out a "Golden Bull Award" for "the worst examples of written tripe". The name of this award also comes from a common English idiom. "Bull" is short for "bullshit," which literally means the excrement of a bull, but is often used to mean stupid, dishonest or unbelievable speech or writing. The word "tripe," similar to "bullshit," has both a literal and a figurative meaning. Literally, it means a food made from an animal's stomach lining. As it is used here, "tripe" means something very close to "bullshit."

In other words, the Plain English Campaign's "Foot in Mouth Award" is given to someone famous who speaks stupidly. The "Golden Bull Award" is given to someone famous who writes stupidly. Both awards are sarcastic. They are different from normal awards because they criticise, rather than honor, the people they are given to. Famous winners of the Foot in Mouth Award include George W. Bush and Donald Rumsfeld.

Plain English Campaign has worked for many organisations. Many UK forms and bills carry the Crystal Mark, including the British passport application form. Plain English Campaign is often described in the media as a "pressure group." 

It regularly makes public comments about language-related news stories and about jargon. For example, in 2006 its supporters voted Bill Shankly the author of the greatest football quotation of all time. Plain English Campaign did a survey in 2004 and announced that ‘At the end of the day’ was considered the most irritating cliché. Chrissie Maher, who created Plain English Campaign, was awarded the Order of the British Empire in 1994 for her services to plain communication. Famous supporters of PEC include Margaret Thatcher and broadcaster John Humphrys.December 2014

CATEGORIES: Greek alphabet

Sho (uppercase/lowercase Ϸ ϸ), was a letter added to the Greek alphabet in order to write the Bactrian language. It was used for the "sh" sound in Bactrian. 

[[Koppa (letter)]]

CATEGORIES: Greek alphabet

Koppa or Qoppa (uppercase/lowercase Ϙ ϙ) was a letter of the Greek alphabet that was used in some Greek cities before the alphabet got its classic standard form. It is no longer used in normal writing today. It was pronounced as "k", just like Kappa (Κ). In the 5th century BC, people stopped using it and it fell out of use. Kappa then replaced it. In the order of the letters in the alphabet, it came between Pi and Rho, just like in the Latin alphabet the letter Q comes between P and R. However, they kept Koppa as a sign for the number "90" in the system of Greek numerals, but in a third numerical form. People still sometimes use it in this way, even though they do not use it as a letter to write words.

The letter Koppa at first looked like a circle with a small bar under it. Later it was written more like a pointed S.

The letter Q in the Latin alphabet and the letter Ҁ in the Cyrillic alphabet come from Koppa. 

[[Rho]]

CATEGORIES: Greek alphabet

Rho (uppercase/lowercase Ρ ρ) is the 17th letter of the Greek alphabet. It is used to represent the "r" sound in Ancient and Modern Greek. In the system of Greek numerals, it has a value of 100. Letters that came from it include the Roman R and Cyrillic Р.

In statistics, the lowercase Rho ("ρ") is used to represent population correlation. In physics, the same letter is used to represent density.

[[Sigma]]

CATEGORIES: Greek alphabet

Sigma (uppercase/lowercase Σ σ ς) is the 18th letter of the Greek alphabet. It is used to represent the "s" sound in Ancient and Modern Greek. In the system of Greek numerals, it has a value of 200. Letters that came from it include the Roman S and Cyrillic С.

[[Tau]]

[[Phi]]

CATEGORIES: Greek alphabet

Phi (uppercase/lowercase Φ φ), is the 21st letter of the Greek alphabet, used to represent the "ph" sound in Ancient Greek. This sound changed to "f" some time in the 1st century AD, and in Modern Greek the letter denotes the "f" sound. In the system of Greek numerals, it has a value of 500. The Cyrillic letter Ф came from Phi. In English, φ is pronounced like "f" but transliterated (re-written) as "ph" in words which originate in Ancient Greek. In those words which originate in Modern Greek, such as feta cheese, φ is transliterated as "f". The letter Phi is used to represent the golden ratio (which is about 1.618).

[[Chi (letter)]]

CATEGORIES: Greek alphabet

Chi (uppercase/lowercase Χ χ) is the 22nd letter of the Greek alphabet. It is used to represent the "ch" sound (as in Scottish "loch" or German "Bauch") in Ancient and Modern Greek.

[[Omega]]

CATEGORIES: Greek alphabet, Vowel letters

Omega (uppercase/lowercase Ω ω) is the 24th and the last letter of the Greek alphabet. It stood for a long "o" sound in Ancient Greek. It still stands for "o" in Modern Greek, but there is no longer a difference between long and short vowels, so it sounds the same as Omicron. In the system of Greek numerals, it stands for the number 800. 

There was also once a letter "Omega" Ѡ in the Cyrillic alphabet. It was there so people could spell Greek names both in Cyrillic and in Greek in the same way. However, this letter is no longer used today.

In mathematics, the uppercase omega Ω is used in big-Omega notation (a variant of big-O notation). It is also used to represent the Omega constant. In electromagnetism and engineering, the uppercase Ω is used as the symbol for ohms, which are the units of electrical resistance. In physics and other sciences, the lowercase ω is often used to represent angular frequency. 

In modern English, the phrase "From alpha to omega" expresses the idea of "everything".

[[Sampi]]

CATEGORIES: Greek alphabet

Sampi or Disigma is a mysterious Greek symbol. Its meaning is still debated today. Some believe it to be a replacement of 'san'. Before that, it was a letter that was used in the Greek alphabet in a few Greek cities in the 5th century BC. At that time, it looked like  or . It was probably pronounced like "ts" or "tch" in the dialect of those cities. Over time, it was changed from  to  or  and at last to . Eventually, the letter came out of use, while it was still used to denote "900" in the system of Greek numerals.

CATEGORIES: World Heritage Sites in Canada, Settlements in Newfoundland and Labrador

L'Anse aux Meadows is a historical settlement on the island of Newfoundland in eastern Canada. It was settled by Vikings from Greenland, Iceland, and Norway around the year 1000, almost 500 years before Christopher Columbus came to the Americas. It is the only known Viking place in North America outside of Greenland. The remains of the settlement were discovered in 1960, and were declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1978.http://www.pc.gc.ca/lhn-nhs/nl/meadows/index_e.asp

[[The Wealth of Nations]]

CATEGORIES: 1776 books, Non-fiction books, Economics books

An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations is better known simply as The Wealth of Nations. It was written by Adam Smith in 1776, who was a Scottish man. It looks at division of work, following self-interest, and freedom of trade.

The book was not the beginning of classical economics, and market economics. Smith said that if everyone did what was best for themselves, the result would be best for society. Before that, economics was about the king's personal interests, and the wealth of a nation was measured by the king's treasury or by the gold and silver in the country. 

Smith said what's important is what's best for the whole nation, and that wealth should be measured by the yearly income of the nation. He wanted to discover how wealth can grow, and how people could do things to support that growth. Smith's book said land, labour, and capital were the three "factors of production" and the main contributors to a nation's wealth.

Prices naturally adjust to having more or less of something: supply and demand. If there is too much of something (more supply), prices go down so that people have more reason to buy it. If a lot of people want something (high demand), there may not be enough of it (scarcity); there will be a competition among the people who want to buy it, and some people will agree to pay more to get what they want, and prices go up. 

Smith said markets should be free. At the time, some big companies (like the East India Company) were controlled by the government. Sometimes the rulers made laws that were good for themselves but not for workers or customers. For example, in the American colonies, colonists could grow cotton but were not allowed to make clothing from it. They had to ship it to England to be made into clothing, then buy it back after it was finished. Smith said this was bad for individuals and for society. He thought it was better for money to flow freely and naturally between buyers and sellers without outside interference. Money would naturally go to the sellers who made the best product at the best price. This way if people did what was best for them, it would end up being best for society as a whole, almost like an "invisible hand" was guiding everything.

[[Rankine scale]]

CATEGORIES: Units of temperature

The Rankine scale is a thermodynamic (absolute) temperature scale. It is based around absolute zero. Rankine is similar to the Kelvin scale in that it starts at absolute zero and 0 °Ra is the same as 0 K but is different as a change of 1 °Ra is the same as a change of 1 °F (Fahrenheit) and not 1 °C (Celsius). Note that the abbreviation °R is ambiguous, as it can also refer to the Réaumur scale. 

The Kelvin and Rankine temperature scales are defined so that absolute zero is 0 kelvins (K) or 0 degrees Rankine (°R). The Celsius and Fahrenheit scales are defined so that absolute zero is −273.15 °C or −459.67 °F.

The Rankine scale was originally used in the United States.

[[High fidelity]]

CATEGORIES: Sound

High fidelity or hi-fi is a way of describing a very good home music system. "High fidelity" means that the sound is as close to the original as possible with no changes or added noise. People who like hi-fi are sometimes called audiophiles. Hi-fi is often now called "high-end audio".

[[Derby]]

Derby is a city in the East Midlands region of England. It is on the banks of the River Derwent in the south of Derbyshire. In the 2001 census, 233,700 people lived there. At that time, Derby was the 18th largest place in England.

[[Stereo]]

CATEGORIES: Sound

Stereophonic sound, also simply called stereo, is the reproduction of sound using two or more audio  loudspeakers. This creates a pleasant and natural sound heard from various directions, as in natural hearing. 

The word "stereophonic" comes from Greek stereos = "solid" and phōnē = "sound". It was coined by Western Electric.

In popular usage, stereo usually means two-channel sound recording and sound reproduction using data from two speakers. The electronic device for playing back stereo sound is often called "a stereo".

[[Ely, Cambridgeshire]]

CATEGORIES: Settlements in Cambridgeshire, Cities in England

Ely (En-uk-Ely.ogg; IPA /'iːli/, rhyming with "freely") is a cathedral city in the East Cambridgeshire district of Cambridgeshire in the east of England and 23 north north-east of Cambridge.

Ely has been called a city for a long time because it has a cathedral. However, the Royal Charter making it a city was only issued in 1974. Ely's population was 15,102 in 2001. This means Ely is the third smallest city in England. Only after Wells in Somerset and the City of London which are smaller.

The University of Cambridge rowing team has a boathouse on the bank of the river and train there for the annual Boat Race against the University of Oxford.

The 1944 Boat Race was raced on the River Great Ouse near Ely, the only time it has not been held on the River Thames. The race was won by Oxford despite Cambridge being ahead early in the contest.

[[Tube sound]]

CATEGORIES: Sound, Audio technology

Tube sound (or valve sound) is the sound produced by a vacuum tube-based audio amplifier.  All amplifiers distort to some degree; some audiophiles prefer the sound produced by tube amplifiers.  The reasons for the difference in sound between tube and solid state electronic devices is a continuing debate among audiophiles.

[[Sound recording and reproduction]]

CATEGORIES: Sound

Sound recording and reproduction is the storage of sound and playing it back so that a person can hear the same sound more than once. It is a process wherein sound waves are captured by a machine. The machine converts the waves into electrical signals or digital data, that are then stored on recording media (such as gramophone records, cassette tapes, compact discs or computer hard drives). The sound can then be played back by reversing the process.

Most recordings are of music, people speaking or singing, and sound effects. They are usually used for entertainment (fun), or for scientific and historical reasons.

Sound is recorded onto a medium by different methods. The ways that recordings are made have changed a lot since sound was first recorded.

[[Storage area network]]

CATEGORIES: Computing

A Storage area network (SAN) is a computing solution for accessing and storing data. To the user, Storage Area Networks appear to be local to the operating system, but they are actually remote.

To understand the difference between a SAN and Network Attached Storage (NAS), the difference between the file system and storage must be made clear.

The file system is the interface that allows the user to access their data that is stored in physical storage (such as hard disks). From the point of view of the user, their data is saved as files. The file system takes care of storing the file data, which might actually be broken up into pieces and stored in different locations in storage.

On a personal computer, the file system and storage are on the same machine (Direct Attached Storage). In Network Attached Storage, the file system and storage are on a remote server. In a Storage Area Network, the file system is on the local machine, and the storage is on a remote machine.

[[Zeta (disambiguation)]]

[[Rings of Saturn]]

CATEGORIES: Saturn's moons

The rings of Saturn are the planetary rings around the planet Saturn, which can be seen with a small telescope. They consist of many small particles, ranging in size from microscopic to the size of a bus (or bigger) that form clumps that move around Saturn. The particles in the rings are made almost entirely of water ice, with just a small amount of dust and other chemicals.  There are some gaps in the rings.  The moon Pan causes the gap called the "Encke gap" in Saturn's A ring. The Cassini Division, discovered by Giovanni Domenico Cassini, is a gap between the A ring and the B ring. It is a product of orbital resonance.

[[Network-attached storage]]

CATEGORIES: Computer networking

Network attached storage (or NAS) is a computing solution. It means that storage (like a number of hard disks) is put on a computer network, so different users can access it. Today, boxes that already can do this are available rather cheaply. Also, such boxes can be built easily using a small or old computer. NAS is similar to, but easier to set up than a Storage area network.

[[Chanson]]

CATEGORIES: Medieval music, Renaissance music, Song forms

Chanson is the French word for "song".  The word is often used in music to mean any song with French words, but it is more often used when talking about songs in which lyrics have been set to music by French classical composers.

Very often "chansons" refers to the French songs that were sung in the late Middle Ages and Renaissance.  People who sang these chansons were called "chansonniers". They had various forms, including ballade, rondeau and virelai.  Some composers at the time liked to set popular poetry to music.  The earliest chansons were for two, three or four voices, many of them being for three voices.   By the 16th century most were for four voices. Sometimes, the singers were accompanied by instruments. 

[[A-type asteroid]]

CATEGORIES: Asteroids

A-type asteroids are fairly uncommon closer asteroids that have a strong, broad 1 µm olivine feature and a very reddish spectrum shortwards of 0.7 µm. They are thought to come from the completely differentiated mantle of an asteroid.

A-type asteroids are so rare that as of 2005 only 17 had been found.

[[C-type asteroid]]

CATEGORIES: Asteroids

C-type asteroids are asteroids made of carbonates. They are the most common variety taking up around 75% of known asteroids, and an even higher percentage in the farther part of the belt beyond 2.7 AU, which is dominated by this asteroid type. The amount of C-types may actually be higher than this, because C-types are much darker than most other asteroid types except D-types and others common only at the extreme farther edge of the Main Belt.

[[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus]]

CATEGORIES: 80s BC births, 10s BC deaths, Roman people, European politicians

Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (born 88/89 BC, died 12/13 BC) was a Roman politician. He was one of the closest men to Julius Caesar. He was Caesar's deputy in Rome when Caesar was away from Rome defeating Pompey in the battle of Pharsalus in Greece. He served as Pontifex Maximus (High Priest) after Caesar's death. 

Together with Octavian and Mark Antony he formed the Second Triumvirate to oppose the conspirators. The Triumvirate was set up to sideline the Consuls and Senate, which means it was the effective end of the Roman Republic.

Lepidus was older than the other two triumvirs. After the Battle of Philippi, he governed Spain and part of North Africa. He was blamed for a revolt in Sicily. This gave Octavian the excuse to strip him of his offices, except for Pontifex Maximus. He died peacefully in Circeii in Italy about end 12 to early 13 BC.

[[Lacrosse]]

CATEGORIES: Lacrosse

Lacrosse, invented by the Native Americans, is a popular team sport in North America and a national summer sport for Canada. It involves the use of nets, or "heads" as they are called, which consist of a wooden or metal shaft with a net on the end. Hockey is a game based on this sport. 

There are about three different forms of lacrosse based on the different Native American tribes or places of how they played it. One of the ways still played today is called double stick; you play by using a two and a half foot stick in each hand and tossing a deer skin ball in between the two sticks.

The name “lacrosse” was named by the French settlers; with “Crosse” meaning curved stick it is called the curved stick. Lacrosse played a more serious role in Native American culture than anywhere else. It was often used to settle tribal disagreements. Lacrosse was not a very well-known sport until the late nineteenth century.  Now more than half a million people are playing.

==How the game is played== 

Lacrosse has two teams, each with ten players. There is one goalie(using a head much larger than a normal players), three defensemen(using a stick with a longer shaft), three midfielders and three attack men. The goalies defend the goals, and if the ball goes into the goal, the team who scored the goal gains a point. Whoever scores the most goals by the end of the game wins, with an overtime period being played if the game is tied. The game has four quarters and starts with a "face off" at the beginning of each quarter. A face off is when the ball is on the ground to start the game, and one person from each team fights for possession of the ball ball.

[[Steve Reich]]

CATEGORIES: 1936 births, Living people, American composers

Stephen Michael "Steve" Reich (Born October 3, 1936) is an American composer of music in the style of minimalism. He is known for his music made with tape recordings, and instrumental music with a steady beat (such as Music for 18 Musicians).

He also wrote pieces that used what is called a phasing technique. With phasing technique, two parts might be playing the same part but at slightly different speeds. It is almost like a canon, or round. He wrote pieces like these for piano, violin, and, again, for tape recordings.

He also composed such pieces like In C and Different Trains, some of his most popular works. Others include, Drumming, City Life and The Cave.  

The critic Kyle Gann has said Reich "may...be considered...America's greatest living composer."

On January 25, 2007, Reich was named the 2007 recipient of the Polar Music Prize, together with jazz saxophonist Sonny Rollins. On April 20, 2009, Reich was awarded the 2009 Pulitzer Prize for Music for his Double Sextet.

[[Girl group]]

CATEGORIES: Girl groups

A girl group is a music group with a group of female singers who normally harmonise together.

The term "girl group" is also used in a narrower sense in English-speaking countries. It suggests the American female pop singing groups of the late 1950s and early 1960s. They were hugely successful for a time, between the decline of early rock and roll and the British Invasion. Many of them were influenced by doo-wop style.

In the 1950s and 60s, the groups were mostly self-organised, girls who knew each other and often grew up together. The Chantels, for example, were four girl choristers from a Catholic high school in the Bronx, 1957. The Ronettes were two sisters and a cousin.p197 The Supremes were girls from a public housing estate in Detroit, Michigan. They were, and still are, America's most successful vocal group of all time. These groups had managers, of course, because they needed someone to deal with the music industry. But the managers did not set up the groups; they came after the groups were formed.

Later, almost all groups were created by public relations professionals to meet a market need. The Spice Girls were a good example of this. They were put together in the mid-1990s by a family management team. Their managers' idea was to create a girl group to compete with popular boy bands that dominated the pop music scene in the mid- to late-1990s. The Spice Girls sold most albums, and had the best-selling album of all time.

One obvious difference between the earlier groups and the later ones was in their social backgrounds. Earlier American groups, having grown up together, were all of the same social origin and colour. What is more, they had usually sung together, and socialised together, before they formed up as a group. This is also true of most of the earlier British boy groups. The later groups, on the other hand, were deliberately chosen for variety. This was done so that all sections of the audience would have at least one member they could identify with. They had not sung together, or maybe met each other, until their PR manager introduced them.

With the changing times, the marketing of popular music changed greatly, so that direct comparison of sales is not simple. but in many parts of the world digital sales are now the most important.

[[Metic]]

CATEGORIES: Ancient Greece

In Ancient Greece, a metic (metoikos) was a foreigner living in a Greek city-state (polis). The metic did not have the same citizen rights as a citizen who was born in the state he was living in.

The term 'metic' was especially used in ancient Athens in the 4th and 5th centuries BC. A notable metic was Aristotle, who was born in Stageira but lived in Athens for a long time.

Regardless of how many generations of the family had lived in the city, metics did not become citizens unless the city chose to bestow citizenship on them as a gift. This was rarely done. Citizenship at Athens brought eligibility for numerous state payments such as jury and assembly pay, which could be significant to working people. During emergencies the city could distribute rations to citizens. None of these rights were available to metics. They were not permitted to own real estate in Attica, whether farm or house, unless granted a special exemption.

Metics shared the burdens of citizenship without any of its privileges. Like citizens, they had to perform military service and, if rich enough, were subject to special tax contributions. Citizenship was very rarely granted to metics. More common was the special status of "equal rights" (isoteleia) under which they were freed from the usual liabilities.

The system came to an end in Hellenistic Athens, when the purchase of citizenship became very frequent. The census of 317 BC gave 21,000 citizens, 10,000 metics and 400,000 slaves in Attica.

In the Greco-Roman world, free people (non-citizens) living on the territory of a polis were called "paroikoi"  (see etymology of parish), in Asia Minor "katoikoi".

[[Ghoul]]

CATEGORIES: Mythology

A ghoul is a monster from ancient Arabian folklore. Ghouls live in burial grounds and other uninhabited places. The English word comes from the Arabic name for the creature: الغول ghūl, which literally means "demon". The ghul is a devilish type of jinn believed to be sired by Iblis.

The female form is given as "ghouleh" in Muhawi and Kanaana (see ref below). The plural is "ghilan".

Ghoul is also a shapeshifting demon that lives in the desert. The demon can take the form of an animal, especially a hyena. It lures unwary travellers into the desert. It will then kill and eat them. The creature also preys on young children, robs graves, and eats the dead. Because of this habit the word ghoul is sometimes used to refer to an ordinary human such as a grave robber, or to anyone who likes the macabre. 

The star Algol takes its name from this creature.

[[Iconoclasm]]

CATEGORIES: Religious ethics, Christianity of the Middle Ages

Iconoclasm means symbols of a culture (like icons or monuments) being destroyed by people of that same culture. This is usually done for religious or political motives. Often, it occurs together with major political or religious changes. It is generally distinct from destruction by foreigners, for example by Spanish conquistadors in America.  The term does not generally include the specific destruction of images of a ruler after his death or overthrow (damnatio memoriae), for example Akhenaten in Ancient Egypt. 

People who engage in or support iconoclasm are called iconoclasts. This word is also used for people  who are against established dogmata or conventions. Similarly, people who revere or venerate religious images are called idolators.  In an Eastern Orthodox context they are known as iconodules, or iconophiles.

Iconoclasm may be carried out by people of a different religion, but is often the result of sectarian disputes between factions of the same religion. The two Byzantine outbreaks during the 8th and 9th centuries were unusual because the use of images was the main issue in the dispute, rather than a by-product of wider concerns. In Christianity, iconoclasm has generally been motivated by a literal interpretation of the Ten Commandments, which forbid the making and worshipping of "graven images" of God.

Germany is divided into 401 administrative districts. There are 294 rural districts (Landkreise), listed here. There are also 107 urban districts (Kreisfreie Städte / Stadtkreise) listed in List of German urban districts.

Urban districts are large towns or cities which handle their own local government.  Rural districts provide services for the smaller towns and villages in an area.  In some states the towns and villages in a district are joined into ämter (although "amt" is not always the name used).  This is because the towns and villages in the area are too small to provide the local services (for example fire brigade or cemeteries).  If the "Amt" system is used towns or settlements might be "amtfrei" that is, not part of an amt because the town can handle its own local affairs.

In some states there is another level of government, the Regierungsbezirk or governmental district.  Several urban and rural districts are joined together to make a regierungsbezirk, which does some of their jobs, especially things like land-use planning which can affect several districts.

Indonesians also remember him as Bung'' Karno''' or Pak Karno'. Like many Javanese people, he had only one name; in religious contexts, he was occasionally referred to as 'Achmad Sukarno'.

[[Industrialisation]]

CATEGORIES: Economic history

Industrialisation (or industrialization) is a process that happens in countries when they start to use machines to do work that was once done by people. Industrialisation changes the things people do. Industrialisation caused towns to grow larger. Many people left farming to take higher paid jobs in factories in towns.

Industrialisation is part of a process where people adopt easier and cheaper ways to make things. Using better technology, it becomes possible to produce more goods in a shorter amount of time. More things can be produced by fewer people. 

After industrialisation people also do more specialised jobs. For example before industrialisation, a cobbler made the whole shoe. He worked on one pair of shoes, finished that, and then did the next pair of shoes. Industrial shoemaking involves many people in making shoes in a factory. An individual worker has a smaller task, however. One person cuts the sole of the shoe. Another person stitches it on. In short there is division of labour. They make even more shoes when they use cutting machines, sewing machines and other special machines. The factory may be owned by a rich person who can afford the machines, or by a company.

Industrialisation started in England with the industrial revolution in the 18th century. It spread first to parts of Europe, and to North America. In the 20th century industrialisation spread to most other countries.

[[Millau Viaduct]]

CATEGORIES: Transport in France, Steel bridges, Buildings and structures in France, Occitanie

Millau Viaduct is a large bridge in Millau, France in the Département of Aveyron. It was designed by the French structural engineer Michel Virlogeux and British architect Sir Norman Foster.

Before the bridge was built, traffic had to go down into the valley of the Tarn river and pass along the national route N9 near the town of Millau, causing heavy congestion at the beginning and end of the July and August vacation season. The bridge now crosses the Tarn valley above its lowest point, linking the Causse du Larzac to the Causse Rouge, and is inside the perimeter of the Grands Causses regional natural park.

The bridge forms the last link of the A75 autoroute, (la Méridienne) from Clermont-Ferrand to Béziers. The A75, with the A10 and A71, provides a continuous high-speed route south from Paris through Clermont-Ferrand to the Languedoc region and through to Spain, considerably reducing the cost of vehicle traffic traveling along this route. Many tourists heading to southern France and Spain follow this route because it is direct and without tolls for the 340 km between Clermont-Ferrand and Pézenas, except for the bridge itself.

CATEGORIES: Protestant churches in Germany, Buildings and structures in Berlin

The Kaiser Wilhelm Gedächtniskirche  Emperor William Memorial Church is a ruined church in Berlin.  It belongs to the Protestant Evangelical Church in Germany

It is on the Breitscheidplatz, at the end of the Kurfürstendamm.

The old church was built between 1891 and 1895 according to plans by Franz Schwechten.

Emperor Wilhelm II ordered the building of the church to honour his grandfather Wilhelm I. The neo-romanesque style is a reminder of the many Romanesque churches in the Rhineland like Bonn Minster.

Mosaics inside the church showed the life and work of Emperor Wilhelm I. During World War II, the church was destroyed during a British RAF bombing raid in 1943. The only remainder of the old building is the ruin of the belfry, which is also called der Hohle Zahn ("the hollow tooth").

After the war, from 1951 to 1961, a new church was built right next to the site of the old one. the new church was designed by Egon Eiermann.

The new church has a cross made of nails from the old Coventry Cathedral, destroyed by German Luftwaffe bomb attacks in what was called the Coventry Blitz. It was consecrated on May 25, 1962, the same day as the new Coventry Cathedral. Both churches were built next to the ruins of the old building, which were kept as reminders of the horrors of war.

As well as the Coventry cross, the Gedächtniskirche has a cross of the Russian Orthodox Church and a design known as the Stalingrad Madonna by Lieutenant Kurt Reuber, created in December 1942 in Stalingrad (now Volgograd), as symbols of peace between the three countries that were once at war.

In December 2007, Charles Jeffrey Gray, a former British pilot who carried out World War II bombing raids over Germany, joined a campaign to rescue the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church from decay. After reading about the condition of the Church, Gray contacted Wolfgang Kuhla, the chairman of the church's advisory board, asking for its tower be restored. A fund was launched to help raise the costs of its repair.

Many believe that his excommunication and execution were not legal. However, his beatification and canonization is opposed by many Jesuits, who think Savonarola's attacks on the papacy to have been a serious crime.

[[BitTorrent]]

CATEGORIES: File sharing, Software

BitTorrent is a peer-to-peer program, first developed in mid-2001 by Bram Cohen and BitTorrent, Inc., to use for uploading and downloading files under the BitTorrent protocol. In the protocol, a "Tracker" hosts information about any active computers which are trying to share data. Trackers are used to find other active computers, but do not store or share file data. Using the .torrent files, BitTorrent users can "Leech" (download) the files. Once a "Leecher" gets 100% of the file(s), they become a "Seeder" and helps "Seed" (upload) the files to other Leechers.

BitTorrent was the first client written for the protocol. Before version 6.0, BitTorrent was written in Python, and was free software. The source code for versions up to and including 3.4.2 were distributed under the MIT license and versions 4.x and 5.x were released under the BitTorrent Open Source License, a modified version of the Jabber Open Source License. Since version 6.0, BitTorrent is a rebranded version of µTorrent. As a result, its source is closed.

The BitTorrent protocol now has many clients, for example :

CATEGORIES: 2005, Australian criminals, Australian drug dealers, Australian prisoners, Bali, 2000s in Australia, 2000s in Indonesia

The Bali Nine is the name of the nine Australian citizens arrested and convicted for drug trafficking on April 17, 2005, in Denpasar, Bali, Indonesia. The group tried to smuggle 8.3 kg of heroin valued at about 4 million AUD from Indonesia to Australia. 

Members of the group are: Andrew Chan, Si Yi Chen, Michael Czugaj, Renae Lawrence, Tach Duc Thanh Nguyen, Matthew Norman, Scott Rush, Martin Stephens and Myuran Sukumaran. All of them are between ages 18 and 28 at the time of their arrests. 

After the trial, two of the Bali Nine received death sentences, and the others got 20 years or life sentences. Renae Lawrence finished serving her 20-year sentence in Kerobokan Prison together with Schapelle Corby. Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran were executed by firing squad on 29 April 2015.

[[Eunuch]]

CATEGORIES: Human sexuality

A eunuch is a castrated man. His genitals have been removed. This can be cutting off the testicles or removing the penis and the testicles.

Over the millennia since, eunuchs had a lot of different functions in different cultures such as domestics, treble singers, religious specialists, government officials, military commanders, and guardians of women or harem servants. When eunuchs ran a harem, a monarch could be sure he was the one who fathered his wives' children since real eunuchs were always infertile.

In Byzantine art, angels and eunuchs were often shown in a similar light and manner.

[[Antares Telescope]]

CATEGORIES: Telescopes

The ANTARES Experiment is a telescope that is built at the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea. But it is not a normal telescope that uses light to see distant objects. Instead, it uses neutrinos, very small and light particles that can fly through the earth. The name comes from Astronomy with a Neutrino Telescope and Abyss environmental RESearch project. There is also a star called Antares.

[[Cherenkov radiation]]

Cherenkov radiation, also known as Vavilov–Cherenkov radiation (tʃ; Russian: Черенков) is a type of electromagnetic radiation produced by charged particles when they pass through an optically transparent medium at a speed which is greater than the speed of light in that medium. (It doesn't violate special relativity because the refractive index slows down the speed of light in a medium. So, the particle doesn't have to travel at the speed of light in a vacuum.) It is named after Pavel Alekseyevich Čerenkov, who discovered this phenomenon in 1934 under the supervision of Sergey Vavilov. Igor Tamm and Ilya Frank developed a theory on this effect in 1937. Pavel Čerenkov, Igor Tamm and Ilya Frank shared the 1958 Nobel Prize in physics because of their contribution in cherenkov radiation.

[[Source code]]

CATEGORIES: Software

In computer programming, source code is (generally speaking) a text file version of a computer program or software that contains instructions that the computer follows to do something. Source code is written in a programming language which a human can read and change.  A large program may contain many different source code files that all work together. Source code is in many cases compiled before running it. That means translating the code into assembly language or machine language which is much faster and easier for the computer to read, but hard for a human to read. Another very common way is to interpret the code, without needing a compilation step, while that's generally slower.

A computer program may be open source, which means the source code is shared with anyone who wants to look at it and change it. Many programs are however closed source, which means only the executable code is distributed and people are not allowed to look at and change the code. Many open source programs are also compiled to such code, that may or may not be allowed to be inspected, while to change it is most convenient to change the source code that came with it, or possibly can be downloaded.

[[Legendary Pokémon]]

CATEGORIES: Pokémon monsters

Legendary Pokémon are very rare Pokémon in the Pokémon world. Characters in the series often claim that very few people have seen them. They are hard to catch, and are stronger than most other Pokémon. They have powers that other Pokémon do not have. In the games some roam around, while others stay in one spot until the trainer knocks it out or captures it.July 2010 If the player defeats a legendary Pokémon, they will often not be available again, because there is only one of them, in rare cases they might reappear after certain conditions are met. Because of this, players usually save their game before going to battle the Pokémon.July 2010 The Master Ball and Ultra Ball are popular choices for catching legendary Pokémon. But legendary Pokémon can also be caught with a normal Poké Ball. It is often advised to catch a legendary Pokémon with a Quick Ball since a Quick Ball has a high capture rate at the beginning of a battle. Legendary Pokémon typically have a 3/255 catch rate with Ultra Balls, and 1/255 catch rate with regular Poké Balls.

The Crimean War (1853–1856) is also called  the Eastern War (Восточная война). It was a war fought between the Russian Empire on one side and French Empire, the United Kingdom, the Kingdom of Sardinia and the Ottoman Empire on the other side. Most of the fighting, including the Battle of Balaclava, happened in Crimea, but some was in western Turkey and around the Baltic Sea. 

The Crimean War is sometimes called the first "modern" war, since its weaponry and tactics were used for the first time and affected all later wars. It was also the first war to use a telegraph to give information to a newspaper quickly.

[[Homophobia]]

CATEGORIES: LGBT, Hatred, Discrimination, Homophobia

Homophobia is the fear or poor treatment of homosexuals. The word was created in the 1960s by a psychologist named George Weinberg. The word "homophobia" is often used together with the word "transphobia" in documents explaining human rights violation of LGBT people by United Nations and Council of Europe.

There are events to stop homophobia, like the "gay pride parades" and "International Day Against Homophobia" on May 17. It was first celebrated on 17 May 2005 in more than 40 countries. Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and Colombia have developed mass media campaigns against homophobia since 2002. In some places, it is illegal to treat people badly because they are homosexual, and it is a hate crime to hurt them for that reason. Laws against such discrimination have been made in several countries. Internationally, the Declaration of Montreal and the Yogyakarta Principles were adopted in 2006.

Successful strategies to prevent homophobic prejudice and bullying in schools have included teaching students about historical figures who were gay, or who suffered discrimination because of their sexuality. A person who is homophobic may be called a homophobe. 

Homophobia is often related to heterosexism, the belief that sex and love between men and women is better than other types of sex and love. Such as sex between two men or sex between two women.

[[Congo River]]

CATEGORIES: Rivers of Africa, Geography of Angola, Geography of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Geography of the Republic of the Congo

The Congo River (also known as Zaire River) is the largest river in Africa. Its overall length of 4,700 km (2,922 miles) makes it the second longest in Africa (after the Nile). The river and its tributaries flow through the second largest rain forest area in the world, second only to the Amazon Rainforest in South America.

The river also has the second-largest flow in the world, behind the Amazon, and the second-largest watershed of any river, again trailing the Amazon. Its watershed is a little larger than that of the Mississippi River. Because large parts of the river basin sit north and south of the equator, its flow is steady, as there is always at least one river having a rainy season.

The Congo gets its name from the old Kingdom of Kongo which was at the mouth of the river. The Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of the Congo, both countries sitting along the river's banks, are named after it. From 1971 to 1997, the Democratic Republic of the Congo was called Zaire and its government called the river the Zaire River.

The sources of the Congo are in the Highlands and mountains of the East African Rift, as well as Lake Tanganyika and Lake Mweru, which feed the Lualaba River.  This then becomes the Congo below Boyoma Falls.  The Chambeshi River in Zambia is usually taken as the source of the Congo because of the accepted practice worldwide of using the longest tributary, as with the Nile River.

The Congo flows mostly west from Kisangani just below the falls, then slowly bends southwest, passing by Mbandaka, joining with the Ubangi River, and running into the Pool Malebo (Stanley Pool). Kinshasa (formerly Léopoldville) and Brazzaville are on opposite sides of the river at the Pool, where the river narrows and falls through a few cataracts in deep canyons (collectively known as the Livingstone Falls), running by Matadi and Boma, and into the sea at the small town of Muanda.

[[Izanami]]

CATEGORIES: Japanese mythology

Izanami is a goddess of both creation and death in Japanese mythology. She is said to have died giving birth to one of her children  and was sent to Yomi, the land of the dead. Izanagi, her husband, came down to Yomi to bring her back to earth. While she Izanami was in Yomi, she felt hungry and ate the fruit. After eating the fruit, she turned into one of the undead, a rotting, maggot-infested pile of flesh. When Izanagi arrived, she would not step out from the shadows and told her husband to go back to earth. Izanagi tried to persuade her to come back with him and she agreed if she could take a rest in her bedchambers, forbidding Izanagi to enter. Izanagi, anxious to return to earth, snuck into her chambers and, taking his comb from his hair, lit it on fire, showing him her rotting body. Izanami woke up and seeing him, became enraged. Izanagi fled from the underworld and sealed the way with a giant rock. Izanami then became known as the Shinigami, the goddess of death. Izanami vowed to kill 1,000 people everyday, and Izanagi vowed to create 1500 every day.

[[Computer architecture]]

CATEGORIES: Computer hardware

In computer engineering, computer architecture is the conceptual design and fundamental operational structure of a computer system. It is the technical drawings and functional description of all design requirements (especially speeds and interconnections), it is how to design and implement various parts of a computer — focusing largely on the way by which the central processing unit (CPU) operates internally and how it accesses addresses in memory.

It can be defined as the science and art of selecting and interconnecting hardware components to create computers that meet functional, performance and cost goals.

Computer architecture includes at least three main subcategories:

Once both ISA and microarchitecture has been specified, the actual computing system needs to be designed into hardware. This design process is called implementation. Implementation is usually a hardware engineering design process. 

Implementation can be further broken down into three but not fully separate pieces: 

For CPUs, the entire implementation process is often called CPU design; it can also be a family of related CPU designs, such as RISC and CISC.

The CN Tower is a telecommunications tower in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is 553.33 tall and is the tallest free-standing structure (meaning it cannot have wires to keep it standing) in Canada, North America, and the Western Hemisphere. It is not the tallest building as there are no floors for people to work or live in. That title goes to One World Trade Center in New York City, New York, United States, which is a bit shorter at 1776 tall. It is not the tallest structure of any kind in the Americas either, as the KVLY-TV mast in North Dakota, also in the United States, is taller at 2063, but that needs wires to keep it upright.

Construction of the concrete tower started on February 6, 1973. In 1975, while it was still being built, it became taller than the Ostankino Tower in Moscow. When it opened to the public  on June 26, 1976, it became the tallest free-standing structure on land in the world. It held this record for more than thirty years, until the Burj Khalifa, while it was still being built, became taller on September 12, 2007 . The CN Tower continued to be the world's tallest tower until the Canton Tower became taller in 2010. It is now the ninth tallest building in the world and the fifth tallest free-standing structure behind both of these, the Shanghai Tower, and the Burj Khalifa.

The "CN" in the tower's name came from the Canadian National Railway, the railway company that built the tower.  In 1995, the railway sold the tower to the Canada Lands Company (CLC).  Local residents wanted to keep the name CN Tower, though, so the abbreviation is now a shortened form of Canada's National Tower instead of the original Canadian National Tower. Neither of these names are commonly used, though; the tower is usually called the CN Tower.

Today, the CN Tower is an important icon of Toronto and has more than two million tourists and visitors every year. It has been one of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World since 1995.

It has a restaurant that spins around every 1 hour & 12 minutes

[[Albrecht Dürer]]

CATEGORIES: 1471 births, 1528 deaths, German painters, German artists, People from Nuremberg, Engravers, German mathematicians, German printmakers

Albrecht Dürer (21 May 1471 – 6 April 1528) was a German painter, engraver and mathematician.

He was born on May 21, 1471 and died on April 6, 1528 in Nuremberg, Germany and is best known as a maker of old master prints. His prints were often in a series, so that there is a group of different prints about a subject.  The most famous series are the Apocalypse (1498) and his two series on the passion of Christ, the Great Passion (1498–1510) and the Little Passion (1510–1511).

Dürer's best known individual engravings (that is, ones that are not part of a series) include Knight, Death, and the Devil (1513), Saint Jerome in his Study (1514) and Melencolia I (1514). His most iconic images are his woodcuts of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (1497–1498) from the Apocalypse series, the Rhinoceros, and numerous self-portraits in oils.  Dürer possibly did not cut his own woodblocks but may have employed a skilled carver who followed his drawings faithfully. He painted a number of religious works in oils and made many brilliant watercolours and drawings, which through modern reproductions are now perhaps his best known works.

Dürer's prints made him famous across Europe before he was 30, and many people say he is the greatest artist of the Renaissance in Northern Europe.

[[El Greco]]

CATEGORIES: 1541 births, 1614 deaths, Crete, Spanish painters, Greek people, People from Toledo, Spain, Spanish sculptors, Spanish architects

El Greco ("The Greek", 1541 – 7 April 1614) was a painter, sculptor, and architect of the Spanish Renaissance. He usually signed his paintings in Greek letters with his full name, Doménicos Theotokópoulos (Δομήνικος Θεοτοκόπουλος).

El Greco was born in Crete, which was the center of Post-Byzantine art at that time. He trained and became a master of that kind of art before travelling at 26 to Venice, as other Greek artists had done. In 1570, he moved to Rome and opened a workshop and made a series of works. While he was in Italy, El Greco added elements of Mannerism and of the Venetian Renaissance to his style. In 1577, at the age of 36, he moved to Toledo, Spain, where he lived and worked until his death in 1614. In Toledo, El Greco painted his best-known paintings.

El Greco's dramatic and expressionist style puzzled other painters at the time, but came to be appreciated in the 20th century. El Greco is considered to have influenced both the Expressionist and Cubist styles. His personality and works inspired poets and writers like Rainer Maria Rilke and Nikos Kazantzakis. Many modern scholars think that El Greco belongs to no conventional school. He is best known for long figures and often fantastic or dramatic coloring, combining Byzantine traditions with Western painting traditions. His paintings generally have very bright parts contrasting with very dark parts.

[[Lord Byron]]

George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron (22 January 1788 – 19 April 1824) was an English peer, nobleman, politician, and poet. He was christened George Gordon Byron, but changed his name later in life. He adopted the surname Noel, so he that could inherit half his mother-in-law's estate.

Lord Byron was the son Captain John Byron and Catherine Gordon.

He was a leading figure in Romanticism. He was regarded as one of the greatest European poets and many people still read his works. Among his best-known works are the narrative poems Childe Harold's Pilgrimage and Don Juan.

Lord Byron is also famous for the way he lived his life. He was a dandy, living extravagantly, with many love affairs and debts. His fight against the Turks in the Greek War of Independence led to his death from a fever in Messolonghi in Greece. He is buried in the family vault in St. Mary Magdalene Church, Hucknall Torkard, Nottinghamshire, England. A memorial was not raised to him in Poet's Corner in Westminster Abbey until 1969.

He was bisexual (homosexual acts between males were against the law at the time), and he was believed to have been guilty of incest with his half-sister. Lady Caroline Lamb, who was his lover for a time, said that he was "mad, bad, and dangerous to know."

His daughter, Ada Lovelace, was famous because she collaborated with Charles Babbage on the "analytical engine," a predecessor to modern computers.

The Greek War of Independence (1821–1829), also commonly known as the Greek Revolution, was a successful war by the Greeks who won independence for Greece from the Ottoman Empire. Muhammad Ali Pasha sent his son Ismail with an army and a fleet to help fight the Greeks and the Greek Christian revolutionaries asked for help from European Christians. A fleet of the United Kingdom, France and Russia destroyed the Ottoman-Egypt fleet in the Battle of Navarino. After a long and bloody struggle, independence was finally achieved, and confirmed by the Treaty of Constantinople in July 1832. The Greeks were thus the first of the Ottoman Empire's subject peoples to be accepted as an independent sovereign power.

[[American robin]]

CATEGORIES: Birds of North America, Thrushes

The American robin (Turdus migratorius) is a migratory songbird. Also known as the North American robin, it belongs in the thrush family, Turdidae. It was named after the European robin. This is because the European robin has a bright orange-red face and breast. The two species are not closely related. The American robin has seven subspecies. T. m. confinis is the most different subspecies.

The American robin lives throughout North America. It is a rare vagrant to western Europe (a vagrant is a bird that is found outside its normal species' range). It has also been a vagrant to Greenland, Jamaica, Hispaniola, Puerto Rico, and Belize. The American robin can be found in many different kinds of habitats. It likes open areas of ground to feed and areas with trees or shrubs to breed and sleep. Because it has a large range, the IUCN Red List says that the American robin will not decline, and is listed as of least concern.

The American robin begins to breed shortly after returning to northern North America after spending the winter in the south. The female will choose where to build the nest. She will make the nest with grass, sticks, paper, feathers, rootlets, and moss. Once the nest is built, she will lay 3 to 5 eggs. After the chicks leave the nest, both parents will continue to take care of them, until they can live on their own.

American robin eggs and juveniles are eaten by squirrels, snakes, blue jays, common grackles, American crows, and common ravens. The adults are eaten by hawks, cats, and larger snakes. Sometimes, the brown-headed cowbird lays its eggs in the Robin's nest. This is called brood parasitism. However, the robin usually rejects the cowbird eggs.

[[New-age music]]

CATEGORIES: New Age music

New-age music is a type of music which is often related to New Age belief. It is usually soft and instrumental; it means, only few New Age music pieces have a singer. New Age music is good for resting, thinking and meditation.

One of the first people in this genre was Stephen Halpern. He created music to be used for meditation. He could not find a record company for his works, so he published them himself and sold them in New Age stores. His music is very relaxing and has a slow rhythm.

Some of the famous artists who work in this field are Yanni, Kitarō, Jean Ven Robert Hal, Loreena McKennitt, Vangelis, Enya and George Winston.

The term is a French word for the taprooms or cafés where this form of entertainment was born, as a more artistic form of café-chantant. It comes from Middle Dutch cabret, through Old North French camberette, from Late Latin camera. It essentially means "small room."

Cabaret also refers to a Mediterranean-style brothel – a bar with tables and women who talk, arouse, and entertain the clients. Traditionally these can also have some form of stage entertainment: often singers & dancers – the bawdiness of which varies with the quality of the place. It is the classier, more sophisticated cabaret that eventually engendered the form of place and art form that is the subject of the remainder of this article.

[[Thomas Aquinas]]

St. Thomas Aquinas, (1225 – 7 March 1274) was a Catholic Dominican priest from Italy, and is a Catholic saint and philosopher. He was born in Roccasecca, as the son of Count Andulf of Aquino and Countess Theodora of Teano.

His early education was at the Benedictine monastery at Monte Cassino. He attended the University of Naples, where he got the nickname "dumb ox" for his slow demeanor, though he was an intelligent and talented student. He studied philosophy, Catholic theology, church history, liturgy, and canon law. 

By 1240, he became interested in the religious life and decided to become a friar with the new Dominican Order. His family captured him and brought him back because to become a Dominican one must eliminate material wealth. His parents expected him to follow in his uncle’s footsteps and become a Benedictine abbot. They kept him in a castle in an effort to change his mind. However, when they released him two years later, he immediately joined the Dominicans.

He was the author of the cosmological argument. Catholics think Aquinas is the best teacher for one who wants to become a priest. His most famous book is Summa Theologica. Aquinas is one of the 33 Doctors of the Church. Many schools are named after him including the Pontifical and Royal University of Santo Tomas in Manila, Philippines.

Aquinas is also known for his work with natural law. Aquinas took an optimistic view of human nature, believing that it is human nature to do good and not evil.

[[Nut (fruit)]]

CATEGORIES: Botany, Nuts

A nut is a hard-shelled fruit of some plants. They are an important part of human and animal diets. Many dried seeds and fruits are called 'nuts' in English, but only some are nuts to a botanist. 

Nuts are made of the seed and the fruit, where the fruit does not open to release the seed. Most seeds come from fruits, and the seeds are released from the fruit. But nuts (such as hazelnuts, hickories, chestnuts and acorns) have a stony fruit wall which keeps the seed inside. 

In common speaking, many so-called nuts, like pistachios and Brazil nuts, are not nuts in a biological sense. Everyday common usage of the term often refers to any hard-walled, edible kernel as a nut.

[[Speed of sound]]

CATEGORIES: Sound, Wave physics

The speed of sound is 1235 per hour or 330 per second in dry air in room temperature.  It travels at 1500 meters per second through water.  Sound moves faster through liquids and solids than air, since they have a larger specific modulus, meaning they are stiffer. Sound cannot travel through a vacuum, which is a space without any air or matter.  The speed of sound is affected by temperature. It travels slower at low temperatures, for example in the stratosphere.

You can calculate the speed of sound like this:

Where:

T is temperature (in Kelvins)

The speed of sound is also known as Mach 1. Things that go faster are supersonic, and things that go five times that speed (Mach 5) are hypersonic.

[[Poliomyelitis]]

CATEGORIES: Diseases caused by viruses

Poliomyelitis, or polio, is a virus that causes a serious disease. It is spread from person to person.  

Most of the time, polio has no symptoms unless the polio virus gets into the blood. It is uncommon for the virus to enter the brain or spinal cord. If this does happen, it can cause muscles to become paralyzed. Some people get better from the paralysis. Others will be disabled. Depending on which muscles have been affected, these people may need a mobility aid or a wheelchair; they may have difficulty using their hands; or they may even have trouble breathing.  

About 15 out of every 10,000 adults who get polio die.  (This means an adult has a 0.015% chance of dying from polio.) 

Vaccination with polio vaccines could stop the disease all over the world. Organizations like the World Health Organization have been trying to vaccinate as many people as possible against polio. Vaccinations have eliminated polio from most countries in the world. 

Worldwide, polio has become much less common in the past few decades.  In 1988, there were about 350,000 cases of polio in the world.  By 2007, the number of cases of polio in the world had decreased by over 99.9%, to just 1,652 cases.

The 32nd President of the United States, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, had polio.  So far, he is the only President of the United States to have had this disease.

Burj Khalifa (برج خليفة, "Khalifa Tower") is an extremely tall skyscraper in Dubai, United Arab Emirates named after Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, and is the tallest building ever built, at 828. Before the building opened, it was called Burj Dubai. The building is 162 stories high. Construction of the tower was started on 6 January 2004, and the building was officially opened on 4 January 2010, almost 6 years later. It is the tallest structure made by humans in the world. The building is more than 300 taller than Taipei 101. Taipei 101 was the tallest building until 2010 before Burj Khalifa was built.

Adrian Smith designed the tower. He worked with Skidmore, Owings and Merrill (SOM) until 2006. It was built by Samsung Engineering & Construction, Besix, and Arabtec. The tower cost US $1.5 billion to build.  The building is part of a 2 building project on Sheikh Zayed Road, Downtown Burj Khalifa. It is near Dubai's main business district.

[[Aswan Low Dam]]

CATEGORIES: Buildings and structures in Egypt, Dams, Nile, 1902 establishments, 1900s establishments in Egypt

The Aswan Low Dam or Old Aswan Dam is a dam across the Nile River in Aswan, Egypt. It is built of masonry and held in place just by gravity. It was the first dam across the Nile, and was built by the British between 1899 and 1902. When it was done, it was the largest masonry dam in the world. This type of dam is called a buttress dam.

The dam was built at the former first cataract of the Nile, and is about 1000 km up-river and 690 km (direct distance) south-southeast of Cairo. When initially constructed between 1899 and 1902, nothing of its scale had ever been attempted.

The dam was designed to provide storage of annual floodwater. The water was used to help dry season flow and support more irrigation. Its height was originally limited because of concern  for the Temple of Isis at Phillae (Philae Temple). That temple was later moved to Agilkia Island in Lake Nasser.

The dam provided inadequate storage capacity for planned development and was raised twice, between 1907–1912 and again 1929–1933. These heightenings still did not meet irrigation demands and in 1946 it was nearly over-topped by water in an effort to maximize pool elevation.

This eventually led to the construction of the Aswan High Dam 6 upstream.

The second function of the dam is to provide electricity. The dammed water drives a water turbine and generator. It still works today. This technology (hydroelectricity) had been invented in the 19th century in England and Germany, and was by 1900 used in the USA and most European countries.

Egypt got access to the technology because she was, at that time, under British control.   The Khedive was Abbas II, who usually had to do what the British wanted.

[[Water organ]]

CATEGORIES: Musical instruments

The water organ or hydraulic organ is a kind of pipe organ.  As in the pipe organ, the sound is made by air blowing through the pipes, but power to make the air blow does not come from bellows or from electricity as in the modern organ, but from water, for example from a waterfall.

A hydraulis is an early type of pipe organ that was powered by water.  It was invented in the 3rd century B.C., probably by  the Hellenistic scientist Ctesibius of Alexandria.  It was the world's first keyboard instrument.  Many centuries later it developed into the modern pipe organ.

The water organ works by having water and air arriving together in the camera aeolis (wind chamber). Here, water and air separate and the compressed air is driven into a wind-trunk on top of the camera aeolis, to blow the organ pipes.  Two perforated ‘splash plates’ or ‘diaphragms’ stop the water spray from getting into the organ pipes. 

The water, having been separated from the air, leaves the camera aeolis at the same speed as it enters.  It then drives a water wheel, which in turn drives the musical cylinder and the movements attached.  To start the organ, the tap above the entry pipe is turned on and, given a continuous flow of water, the organ plays until the tap is closed again. 

During the Renaissance many Italian gardens had water organs.  The most famous water organ of the 16th century was at the Villa d'Este in Tivoli. It was about 6 metres high and was powered by a beautiful waterfall.  It could play three pieces automatically, but there was also a keyboard.

[[User interface]]

CATEGORIES: Computers

A User interface allows a user to interact with a machine. User interfaces mainly provide two things:

Many machines can be very dangerous. A machine should have a user interface that can be handled easily, even if the person operating the machine has panicked. The user interface should therefore be intuitive, and simple to use. An example of such a user interface is that of the kill switch. A kill switch must shut off the machine at all costs - the idea is to avoid injury or harm to people. This is very different from shutting off the machine at the end of the shift, or when it is no longer needed.

According to EN ISO 13850, the kill switch has to be red on a yellow background.  

The colors used to mark different states are close to those used by signals used on the road.

There may be additional symbols, for example:

In many cases, such symbols are better, because some people are color blind. They need to be explained, like warnings, though.

User interfaces are composed of one or more layers including a human-machine interface (HMI) using physical input devices such as keyboards, mice, and game pads as well as output hardware such as computer monitors, speakers, and printers. User Interface (UI) Design focuses on anticipating what users might need to do and ensuring that the interface has elements that are easy to access, understand, and use to facilitate those actions. UI brings together concepts from interaction design, visual design, and information architecture. 

UI design is closely linked to user experience (UX) design. Both are crucial for the success of a digital product, and both terms are often used interchangeably. However, they’re not the same thing. UI design is the process of creating interfaces with a focus on the surface, the looks, and style, while UX design covers the entire experience a user has with a website or app.

[[Bohemianism]]

CATEGORIES: Lifestyles

The word Bohemian was first used in Paris to mean a Gypsy because many people thought that Gypsies came from Bohemia. The word was then used in the late 19th century (1800s) for poor painters, writers, musicians and actors who often travelled to Paris from other towns and tried to earn money. Paris was a famous town for painters, writers, and musicians to gather, to learn from each other and to enjoy the life of the city. Many of them lived at Montmartre, not far from the "Moulin Rouge". One of the most famous painters to live in Montmartre was Henri Toulouse-Lautrec. He loved to paint the can-can dancers and prostitutes. He did many posters to advertise the nightclubs. The posters are now famous works of art. 

In the 20th century the word "Bohemian" spread to other countries and was used to describe the lives of many different artists of different sorts. The sort of behaviour that was thought of as "Bohemian" included whether a person had a regular job, how they dressed, their political views, their religious views, their sexual behaviour and the entertainment they liked. 

People who were called "Bohemians" were often very poor, because they tried to live by painting, acting or writing. It was hard to make a living. They generally wore old or second-hand clothing, and could not afford a good hair-cut. They often shared the room in the roof of a house, which was cheap, because it was cold in winter, hot in summer and often had birds living there as well. In some ways the life of a bohemian artist was difficult, but it gave people freedom to express themselves, that was often not found in more conservative society, where everyone worried about what other people thought of them, and cared a lot about things like clothes and houses. Sometimes students from richer families would come to live a "Bohemian life style", so that they could feel the same freedom to express themselves.  

During the 20th century, many cities apart from Paris have areas where people have lived Bohemian lifestyles. One of the problems is that these areas often become fashionable for rich people. This soon drives away the poor artists and students, because they can no longer afford the rent.

[[Henry Willis]]

CATEGORIES: Organ builders

Henry Willis (born: 27 April 1821, London - died: 11 February 1901, London) was a British builder of pipe organs. He built a very large number of organs, many of them for big cathedrals and concert halls in Britain, such as St. Paul's Cathedral, Truro Cathedral, and the Royal Albert Hall. He also built an organ for Queen Victoria at Windsor Castle. Many of the organs that he built are in other parts of the world, especially in countries that belonged to the British Empire. 

Many organists who gave organ recitals liked Henry Willis’s organs because they had lots of different sounds which helped to make the organ sound like an orchestra. He made organs for churches where the architects were getting rid of the central screen so that the organ could be heard better in the main part of the church (the nave). He used ideas that had been created by the French organ builder Cavaillé-Coll and by Barker. He made several inventions himself, including the thumb piston, which made it possible for an organist to change the combination of stops without taking his hands off the keyboard.

Four generations of the Willis family continued the family tradition of organ building until 1997, when Henry Willis IV retired and the new Managing Director of the firm was not a member of the Willis family. The Company, founded in 1845, Henry Willis & Sons, Ltd. still makes organs in Liverpool.

[[Drug addiction]]

CATEGORIES: Health problems, Human issues, Illegal drugs, Addiction

Drug addiction, also called substance dependence or dependence syndrome, is a condition where a person feels a strong need to take a drug. Addiction also involves other behaviours. These include finding it difficult to control the need to use the drug and feeling the use of the drug to be more important than more normal things such as family or work. When the person does not use the drug for an amount of time, they may suffer from withdrawal.

When a person is addicted, they are usually addicted to a class (a specific kind) of drug. For example: Heroin is a drug that is in the Opiate class. Which means that a person addicted to Heroin may also be seen to have an addiction to other opiates such as Morphine.

A person who may easily become addicted to drugs is said to have an addictive personality. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders defines drug addiction as a mental disorder. Drug addiction is often linked with other mental disorders.

[[Aristide Cavaillé-Coll]]

CATEGORIES: 1811 births, 1899 deaths, Organ builders, French people, People from Montpellier

Aristide Cavaillé-Coll (born Montpellier, 4 February  1811; died Paris, 13 October  1899) was a French organ-builder.  Most organists think of him as the greatest organ-builder of the 19th century, and one of the greatest who ever lived.  He invented many new mechanical devices and his organs changed the way that composers could write for the instrument.  César Franck, Alexandre Guilmant, and Charles-Marie Widor, in particular, were strongly influenced by the new type of organ that he was building.

Cavaillé-Coll grouped the stops of the organ into different families, so that the result was similar to the families of instruments in an orchestra.  He made the lowest of the manuals (keyboards) the most important one.  It was called the “Great” (French: “Grande Orgue”).  The other manuals - there were usually two others, but sometimes three - could be “coupled” to the Great.  He made changes to the English swell box, improved its operation, and divided the windchests on which the pipes were resting.  This made it possible to have louder reed stops because of the higher wind pressure.

[[Arp Schnitger]]

CATEGORIES: German people, Organ builders, 1648 births, 1719 deaths

Arp Schnitger (born Oldenburg, 2 July? 1648; buried in Neuenfelde, near Hamburg, 28 July 1719) was a very important German builder of pipe organs. He mostly worked in Northern Europe, especially the Netherlands and Germany, where a number of his instruments survive to the present day. His organs are different from those of Gottfried Silbermann who worked in south Germany. Arp Schnitger had great influence on later organ builders, in particular in the 20th century when people wanted a change from the Romantic 19th century organs and tried to make instruments that sounded like they had done in the Baroque period.

[[Hello Kitty]]

Hello Kitty is a Japanese character of a cat. It was made in 1974 by a Japanese company named Sanrio. Her real name is Kitty White. The character has a large head. She usually has a red bow between her ears. She has no mouth. Sanrio said that she was not given a mouth because she communicates by using the heart instead of speaking one particular language. Hello Kitty is known all over the world.

Hello Kitty became very popular with young school-girls during the 1980s. Because a Japanese singer, Kahara Tomomi, who was very popular among young school-girls said openly that she loved Hello Kitty on the TV. April 2018 In the 1990s Sanrio made more products with the picture of the cat which would appeal to teenagers and young women.

[[Herman's Hermits]]

CATEGORIES: Herman's Hermits, English rock bands, English pop music groups

Herman's Hermits were a rock band from England. They were part of the "British Invasion" of bands during the 1960s, and were most popular in that decade. Their business manager was an American named Allen Klein, who also worked for Donovan, The Animals, and later The Rolling Stones and The Beatles.

None of the members was really named Herman. Lead singer Peter Noone (pronounced "noon") was nicknamed Herman, because his bandmates thought he looked like Sherman, from The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show. Noone was an actor before he became a singer. The other band members were Derek "Lek" Leckenby (guitar), Keith Hopwood (guitar, keyboards), Karl Green (bass guitar) and Barry Whitwam (drums). The band began as amateurs, playing at parties for friends, but turned professional as they improved. They made records, appeared on television, and also made movies.

The Hermits's hit records included "I'm Into Something Good", "Can't You Hear My Heartbeat?", "There's A Kind Of Hush (All Over The World)", "I'm Henry VIII, I Am", "Listen People", and cover versions of "Silhouettes", "Sea Cruise", and "The End Of The World". "Hold On" was the title song of their first movie. "Mrs. Brown, You've Got A Lovely Daughter" was a hit song first, that was later fitted to a movie storyline.

Herman's Hermits stopped having hits as music trends changed, but their old songs were well loved. They are still played today. The band members went on to other careers in the 1970s. Peter Noone went back to acting, but still appeared as a singer.

In the 1980s, Leckenby and Whitwam formed a new band, to tour under the old name. The singer sounded like Noone, and many fans did not know the difference. Other original members also sometimes rejoined. During the 1990s, Noone took over the name for his band, that appeared with him at oldies concerts.

[[Voluntary (music)]]

CATEGORIES: Musical forms

In music a voluntary is a piece of music, usually for organ, which is played as part of a church service.

The word “voluntary” can be used for the title of a piece of music.   The title was often used by English composers in the late Renaissance or Baroque periods for a piece of organ music that was free in style, i.e. it did not have to be composed in a strict form such as sonata form or a fugue.  It was meant to sound as if it was being improvised (the word voluntary in general means “free”, i.e. not “forced to do something”).

Composers such as Orlando Gibbons, John Blow and Henry Purcell wrote voluntaries, although sometimes they preferred to use other titles such as fancy (an English form of the Italian word fantasia), or even fugue.  However, these fugues were not composed in the proper fugue style: they just started off with imitation as in a fugue, but continued in a freer style.

Some voluntaries were called double voluntaries.  These were pieces written for organs with two manuals (keyboards).  The pieces contrasted a loud manual with a soft one.

Some voluntaries were known as trumpet voluntaries.  These were voluntaries which had a tune which was played (with the right hand) on a stop called a “trumpet” or a “cornet”.  Two very famous trumpet voluntaries, often played at weddings, are the trumpet voluntary by Henry Purcell and the one by Jeremiah Clarke (which people used to think was composed by Purcell).  In the 18th century the composer John Stanley wrote many trumpet voluntaries.

[[Area codes in Germany]]

CATEGORIES: Germany, Area codes

Area codes in Germany (Vorwahl) for telephones have  two to five digits, not counting the first zero. The first or "leading" zero must be dialled when calling from inside Germany and not when calling from outside Germany. The area code is not needed when dialling another telephone in the same area, unless one of the telephones is a mobile phone. Usually shorter area codes are used by larger cities, and longer area codes to smaller towns.

The first digit (after the leading zero) shows the region: 

(0)1 are special numbers such as mobile phones (015, 016, 017), shared cost service (0180), televoting numbers (013) and 010 for dial-around services. The OLD codes 0130 for free phone numbers and 0190 for premium-rate numbers are now moved to 0800 and 0900 to meet international standards.

[[Visibility]]

CATEGORIES: Weather

Visibility is a word used in meteorology. It is used to talk about how far a normal person can see depending on the weather. If there is low visibility, such as in a blizzard, a person will not be able to see far. If there is high visibility, such as on a bright, sunny day, a person will be able to see a long way.

Visibility less than 100 is often called zero. When it is this low, roads may be closed, or lights and signs are turned on to warn drivers. These are put in areas that often have very low visibility. Warning lights help stop accidents. Automobile crashes with many cars happen often in places like this if the warning lights and signs are not put up.

Visibility is said to be good when a person can see farther than about 10 kilometers.

An advisory is put out by meteorologists to warn of low visibility, such as a dense fog advisory from the U.S. National Weather Service. These tell drivers to not travel until the fog leaves. Airport travel sometimes is delayed, or slowed down, by low visibility.

In June 2007 he became of the leaders of The Left, formed by a merger of Left Party.PDS and Labour and Social Justice – The Electoral Alternative.

Bisky was born in Zollbrueck, Pomerania. As a child he was very poor, so when he was 18 he moved from northern West Germany to GDR. He was allowed to join the Socialist Unity Party in 1963, but did not became a leader of the party until just after the fall of communism and the old hardliners were thrown out of the party. 

He was rector of the University of Film and Television (Potsdam-Babelsberg) from 1986 to 1990. In 1991 he became a member of the board of directors of regional television channel ORB (now part of RBB.)

The party returned strongly to the Bundestag in the 2005 election. Bisky, one of 54 Left MPs, was going to become one of the six vice presidents of the Bundestag. When the new Bundestag met on October 18, however, he failed three times to be elected. Some MPs explained this with allegations (denied by Bisky) that he was an informant of the Stasi. Later, he failed a fourth time, and gave up his bid to be elected.

[[Pianola]]

CATEGORIES: Percussion instruments

The pianola (pronounce: "pee-ah-NO-la"), also called the player piano, is a piano which has a pneumatic mechanism  so that it can play by itself. The air for this system came from a pump operated by the players feet, and in some later models, an electric pump. Inside the piano are paper rolls which have holes punched in. These holes release air which in turn triggers the keys to play. When the pianola plays itself the keys of the piano can be seen "playing themselves".

The pianola was developed around the 1880s. It was fitted with control levers so that the player ("player pianist" or "pianolist") could play in the way he wanted. The pianola made it possible for the player to sound as if he was playing very difficult music that he was not capable of playing. At the same time he could control the performance.

The pianola became popular in the late 19th and early 20th century as mass-produced pianos became popular in people's homes and more and more people bought sheet music.  By the 1920s it started to become less popular again as the gramophone had been invented.

A pianola is the same as any other piano except it is fitted with a pneumatic player action, which plays paper rolls. This mechanism consists of about one hundred bellows, large and small, the smaller ones being called pneumatics of which there are 88, one for each note on the piano.The largest are the foot operated ones,called the bellows. Other pneumatics of varying sizes operate the roll motor, tracking device, motor speed governor, and the sustain and soft pedals.

[[Sewing machine]]

CATEGORIES: Machines

A sewing machine is used to stitch fabric together with thread.  Sewing machines were an invention of the industrial revolution that made it possible to sew faster than people could sew by hand. Some sewing machines are also used for embroidery.   Since the invention of the first working sewing machine, generally considered to have been the work of Englishman Thomas Saint in 1790, the sewing machine has greatly improved the efficiency and productivity of the clothing industry.

Home sewing machines are designed for one person to sew individual items while using a single stitch type. In a modern sewing machine the fabric easily glides in and out of the machine without the inconvenience of needles and thimbles and other such tools used in hand sewing, automating the process of stitching and saving time.

Industrial sewing machines, by contrast to domestic machines, are larger, faster, and more varied in their size, cost, appearance, and task.

The Hundred Years' War was fought between France and England during the late Middle Ages from 1337 to 1453. The war lasted 116 years and started because Charles IV of France died in 1328 without an immediate male heir (a son or a younger brother). Edward III of England then believed he had the right to become the new king of France through his mother.

Since the French did not want a foreign king, Philip VI of France said that he was king because the Salic law prevented French women from ruling or transmitting the right to rule to their sons. The two countries went to war because the English did not have that rule.

When the war started, France was stronger than England as it was wealthier, and French knights and heavy cavalry also enjoyed a great military reputation in all of Christendom. Also, France had about 17 million people, but England had only about 4 million people. However, France was a decentralised feudal monarchy in the middle ages and so was it was less unified than England. France had an alliance with Scotland and Bohemia, and England was supported by parts of the Low Countries and by some regions in France loyal to the Plantagenet kings of England.

The English won a major victory at sea in the Battle of Sluys in 1340, which prevented France from invading England. Most of the rest of the war was fought in France. England then won an overwhelming victory at the Battle of Crécy in 1346 against all odds. the use of the English longbow and stakes to counter the French cavalry played a decisive role in that victory.

From 1348 to 1356, there was very little fighting because the Black Death killed many people in England and even many more people in France. Edward, the Black Prince, then won a brilliant victory at the Battle of Poitiers for England. King John II of France was captured during the battle. The English invaded France again but were not able to take any more cities. A truce in 1360 gave England about one quarter of France. This first part of the Hundred Years' War is called the Edwardian War.

The war started again in 1369. The new king Charles V of France was more successful, with Bertrand du Guesclin as his best knight. France allied with Castile against England and Portugal, and some of the fighting spilled into Spain and Portugal. France won back most of the land that had been given to the English, and Bertrand du Guesclin won great French victories at the battles of Cocherel and Pontvallain. A peace followed from 1389 to 1415. The second part of the war is called the Caroline War.

Anti-Armenianism is hostility toward or prejudice against Armenian people, Armenian culture and the Republic of Armenia, which can range in expression from individual hatred to institutionalized persecution. Several organizations have stated that difficulties currently experienced by the Armenian minority in Turkey are a result of an anti-Armenian attitude by the Turkish government as well as by ultra-nationalist groups such as the Grey Wolves.

Modern anti-Armenianism often seems to lacks a racial and cultural basis and appears to be based more on geopolitics and history, in addition to diplomatic and strategic interests, involving the modern states of Turkey and Azerbaijan.  The controversy and emotions surrounding the Armenian Genocide and Nagorno-Karabakh are two examples of intense anti-Armenianism in both countries. Modern Anti-Armenianism is usually associated with either extreme opposition to the actions or existence of the Armenian Republic, and belief in an Armenian conspiracy.

[[Istanbul pogrom]]

CATEGORIES: 1955, 20th century riots, Anti-Armenianism, History of Turkey, Istanbul

The Istanbul Pogrom was a pogrom directed primarily against the Istanbul's Greek minority on September 6 and 7, 1955. Jews and Armenians living in the city and their businesses were also targeted in the pogrom, which was, according to some circles, orchestrated by the Turkish government.

A Turkish mob, most of which was trucked into the city in advance, assaulted Istanbul’s Greek community for nine hours. Although the leaders of the pogrom did not explicitly call for Greeks to be killed, between 13 and 16 Greeks (including two Orthodox clerics) and at least one Armenian died during or after the pogrom as a result of beatings and arson.

Thirty-two Greeks were severely wounded. In addition, dozens of Greek women were raped, and a number of men were forcibly circumcised by the mob. 4,348 Greek-owned businesses, 110 hotels, 27 pharmacies, 23 schools, 21 factories, 73 churches and over a thousand Greek-owned homes were badly damaged or destroyed.

Estimates of the economic cost of the damage vary from Turkish government's estimate of 24.8 million US$, the British diplomat estimates of 100 million GBP (about 200 million US$), the World Council of Churches’ estimate of 150 million USD, and the Greek government's estimate of 500 million US$.

The pogrom greatly accelerated emigration of ethnic Greeks from the Istanbul region, reducing the 200,000-strong Greek minority in 1924 to just 2,500 in 2006.

[[Sufjan Stevens]]

Sufjan Stevens (ˈsuːfjɑːn) (born July 1, 1975) is an American singer-songwriter and musician from Petoskey, Michigan.

Some people think he is part of the folk revival in indie pop, but he gets ideas from many things. His music is similar to electronica and the minimalism of Steve Reich. Stevens says that he has plans to make a concept album for each of the 50 U.S. states. He began with Michigan (2003) and Illinois (2005).

Stevens was born in Detroit, Michigan, and grew up in Petoskey. He went to Harbor Light Christian School as well as the Interlochen Arts Academy. He also learned at Hope College in Holland, Michigan.

Sufjan is an Arabic name that famously belonged to Abu Sufyan, a man from early Islamic history. The name was given to Stevens by the person who founded Subud, a spiritual community. Stevens said in an interview, "It sounds like Devendra Banhart kind of grew up in this strange kind of cultish environment, and I don't mean that word in a demeaning way. I think we probably come from similar backgrounds. There's a little bit of that in my history."

Stevens is a multi-instrumentalist, a person who can play many musical instruments. He is well known for his use of the banjo, but also plays guitar, piano, drums, and several other instruments, often playing all of these on his albums by using multitrack recording. When he was in school, he learned the oboe and English horn, which he also plays on his albums. He is one of the few musicians in pop music to use these instruments. A lot of instruments are played in unison to give his songs a "symphony-like" sound. Strings and horns are used very often in many of his songs.

Stevens lives in the Brooklyn part of New York City in the neighborhood Kensington where he makes up the Asthmatic Kitty Records staff of the Brooklyn office. His brother Marzuki Stevens is a marathon runner.

The song The Mystery of Love because of the movie Call Me by Your Name was hit song and won AMFT Awards in 2017.

The hyper engine was a possible aircraft engine model that could produce 1 horsepower per cubic inch of engine displacement.  The term hyper engine was used only in the United States, where the Army Air Corps gave people money to make a hyper engine that had an area of 1,300 cubic inches.  This happened in the 1930s.  They thought that this would better help with streamlining and to help get a better range.  Unfortunately, none of these designs ever made it past the production stage. 

[[Autofeather]]

CATEGORIES: Aircraft engines

Autofeather is a feature of the engines on turboprop or piston engine aircraft. When the power being made by the engine falls to the point where it is not helping add to the thrust, the propeller will go into a feathered mode to help lower the amount of drag.

An automatic feathering system was first brought out into the open on the Martin 4-0-4 aircraft, which was a piston engine airplane. The system was made to automatically feather an engine that failed during takeoff or the initial climb of the plane to its cruising altitude.

[[Argus As 014]]

CATEGORIES: Pulsejet engines

The Argus As 014 was a pulse jet engine used on the German V-1 flying bomber of World War II.  This was meant to be a simple model that would have been easy to make a lot of for not very much money.  The engine was made from a sheet of steel that was rolled into a tube.  A shutter was placed at one of the ends of the tube, along with a fuel valve and an igniter (something that lights things on fire).

It was thought that this could become a good power source for some last ditch German fighters during the last few days of World War II.

[[Inductor]]

CATEGORIES: Electronic components

An inductor is an electrical device used in electrical circuits because of magnetic charge.

An inductor is usually made from a coil of conducting material, like copper wire, that is then wrapped around a core made from either air or a magnetic metal.  If you use a more magnetic material as the core, you can get the magnetic field around the inductor to be pushed in towards the inductor, giving it better inductance.  Small inductors can also be put onto integrated circuits using the same ways that are used to make transistors.  Aluminum is usually used as the conducting material in this case.

Edward, the Black Prince (Woodstock Palace, Oxfordshire, 15 June 1330 – Westminster Palace, 8 June 1376) was the eldest son of King Edward III of England.  

Edward was born at Woodstock Palace, near Oxford. He was made Prince of Wales in 1343, and followed his father into battle against France. He became a famous soldier, helping win the Battle of Crécy and commanding the Battle of Poitiers.  He was a founding member of the Order of the Garter.  In 1361, he married his cousin, Joan of Kent. They had two sons, Edward and Richard. The older son, Edward, died when he was only six.  

Edward of Woodstock has become known in history as "the Black Prince", but no one is quite sure of the reason for the nickname. He died at the age of 45, and was buried at the Canterbury Cathedral. As his father was still living, he never became king himself. He asked his father to give the title Prince of Wales to his son Richard, who later became King Richard II of England. .

[[Charles IV of France]]

Charles invaded Aquitaine, thus renewing the war with England. However, the peace of 1327 was the great triumph which gave him a generous land settlement and 50,000 marks.

During his six years as king Charles IV raised taxes. His expulsion of the Jews from France in 1323 was the culmination of centuries of persecution. They had long suffered from discriminatory taxes and other fiscal policies targeted at Jews, being scapegoated for the Black Plague, and multiple prior attempts to expel them from France. France's Jews were given only a little time to sell to their possessions before being escorted out of French lands. 

Charles died without a son so there were questions about who would be the next king. He had two daughters, but under Salic law, the basis of law in France, there was no inheritance through the female line.

Edward III of England then believed he had the right to become the new king of France, even though he was through the female line and therefore it was against Salic law. Thus he began the Hundred Years' War.

[[Fundamentalism]]

CATEGORIES: Theology, Philosophical movements and positions, Politics

Fundamentalism was used at first to describe some people in the Protestant community in the United States in the early 20th century. These people had a set of well-defined ("fundamental") values. These values were in opposition to more modern ideas. The group also said it was important to stick to what faith (and a more literal translation of the Bible) told them. When people look at religion this way they see the ideas in the religion as absolute. This means that it is not possible for them to change. When religion is seen as absolute it becomes fundamentalism.

Today, the term is used more generally. It is now often used to describe groups of people who are committed to behave or act according to their (mostly moral, and religious) values and beliefs even though these values may be criticised by many people or unpopular. Modern-day fundamentalists want to go back to the roots of certain ideological or religious positions. 

Religious fundamentalism has been prevalent in society since its beginnings in the late 19th- and early 20th-century. People today who study fundamentalism see it as a response to modern society. Today society is not as simple as it was: many people live in societies that can be difficult to understand. Changes in familiar things can make people feel unsafe. So some people look in their religion to see something that does not change. They also want rules about how to act that do not change. So they see their religion as this thing that does not change. 

See Reformation for an older historical precedent.

Fundamentalism is also a trademarked brand of belts "to Beat Children." Fundamentalism Leather Belts have been in countless art exhibits to satirize Fundamentalist Christians who think their God wants them to hit children. The artist and the only publicly recognized owner of Fundamentalism, Daniel Vander Ley, is a child-rights advocate who uses his brand "Fundamentalism America's Premier Child Abuse Brand" as a way to confront governments around the world about corporal punishment practices in schools and homes. Corporal Punishment still occurs in public schools in 19 American states.

[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]

CATEGORIES: Mythology, Literature, Mesopotamia

The Epic of Gilgamesh is an epic poem from ancient Mesopotamia. It is one of the earliest works of literary fiction known.

The most complete version that exists today was preserved on twelve clay tablets in the library collection of the 7th century BC Assyrian king Ashurbanipal.

A series of Sumerian legends and poems about the mythological hero-king Gilgamesh were probably gathered into a longer Akkadian poem some time before the 7th century BC.

The essential story is about the relationship between Gilgamesh, a king who has become distracted and disheartened by his rule, and a friend, Enkidu, who is half-wild and who undertakes dangerous quests with Gilgamesh. Much of the epic focuses on Gilgamesh's thoughts of loss following Enkidu's death. It is often credited as being one of the first literary works with emphasis on immortality.

The epic is widely read in translation, and the hero, Gilgamesh, has become an icon of popular culture.

[[Sorbian languages]]

CATEGORIES: Slavic languages, Sorbs, Languages of Germany

The Sorbian languages are Slavic languages, a branch of the Indo-European languages. 

They are the Sorbs' native languages, who are a Slavic minority in eastern Germany. The languages used to be known as Wendish or Lusatian. 

There are two languages: Upper Sorbian (hornjoserbsce), spoken by about 40,000 people in Saxony, and Lower Sorbian (dolnoserbski), spoken by about 10,000 people in Brandenburg. Both languages are spoken is an area known as Lusatia (Łužica in Upper Sorbian, Łužyca in Lower Sorbian and Lausitz in German).

In Germany, Upper and Lower Sorbian are officially recognized and protected as minority languages by the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. In the home areas of the Sorbs, both languages are officially equal to German.

The city of Bautzen, Upper Lusatia, is the centre of Upper Sorbian culture. Bilingual signs can be seen around the city, including the name of the city, "Bautzen/Budyšin".

The city of Cottbus (Chóśebuz) is considered the cultural centre of Lower Sorbian. Cottbuss also has bilingual signs.

Sorbian is also spoken in the small Sorbian (“Wendish”) settlement of Serbin in Lee County, Texas. Until recently newspapers were published in Sorbian there. The local dialect has been heavily influenced by surrounding speakers of German and English.

American and Australian communities often prefer to call themselves “Wends” or “Wendish” since think that “Sorb” and “Sorbian” are bad words.

[[YHWH]]

CATEGORIES: Biblical people, Gods and goddesses

For Jewish people YHWH is the most holy name of God, as written in the ancient Hebrew language. The written language showed no vowels, so the pronunciation is not agreed on. However, most academics agree that "Yahweh" is the most accepted way to say it.

It has also been pronounced as "Yehova" in Hebrew as a substitute word for the tetragrammaton. This is because Hebrew pointing, or vowel symbols, are often put under the YHWH, making יְהֹוָה. The vowels used come from the Hebrew word for Lord, "Adonai", which after the last captivity, was substituted and the vowels of "Adonai" forced into the tetragrammaton, incorrectly spelling God's Hebrew name as "YaHoVaH".

It was never meant to be anything more than a substitute to avoid pronouncing the tetragrammaton. 

Traditionally, religious Jews today do not often say this name aloud. This is because it is believed to be too holy to be spoken. However, they often use substitutes when referring to the name of their God. For example, they use HaShem ("The Name") or Shem HaMeforash (“the indescribable Name”). 

Today, the three Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity and Islam)  say that there is only one God, defined in the Judeo/Christian

Scriptures as Yahweh almost 7,000 times, with the general name "Elohim" a distant second at 2,500 times. Yahweh was spoken often by Jews. In

the New Testament, Yahweh is also present with the expanded name of Yahshua (Jesus), meaning "Yahweh(Yah) Saves(shua).

Sometimes the four letters are called the Tetragrammaton, which is Greek for four letters

The Hebrew languages has no vowels as was used in Latin or eventually, English. Therefore, the Tetragrammaton, translated from Hebrew to Latin was JHWH. Eventually, it was JHVH in English. Since it does not contain vowels, as does English, vowels were inserted to make the name pronouncable. Therefore JHVH became JEHOVAH.

These four letters are usually JHWH in German, French and Dutch, and either YHWH, YHVH, JHWH or JHVH in English. In some English language Bibles, it is written in all capital letters as "LORD," as in Jewish tradition. Others, such as the Jerusalem Bible use "Yahweh". The Holman Christian Study Bible uses

"Yahweh" when there is a reference to his name; God's Word Translation uses all of the Hebrew transliterations for the name of God.

The name Jehovah is used by the religious organisation of Jehovah's Witnesses based on early English Bible translations repeated by the KJV. They are not the only religious group to pronounce the holy name as Jehovah. When settlers of different religions arrived to settle lands in North America, the name Jehovah was widely used. It is still used by several regions besides Jehovah’s Witnesses. 

In 2008, the "Vatican" reiterated a directive that the full name YAHWEH should not be used in Catholic liturgy out of respect for the Jews who never pronounce the full word and YHWH was to be used instead.

Fra Angelico (c. 1395– February 18, 1455), was an Italian Early Renaissance painter. Giorgio Vasari, who wrote the Lives of the Artists said he had "a rare and perfect talent".

Fra Angelico has been known by many different names. When he was born, he was called Guido di Pietro. People who knew him when he was older called him Fra Giovanni da Fiesole (Brother John from Fiesole). When Giorgio Vasari wrote about him in Lives of the Artists, in the 1500s, he was already known as Fra Giovanni Angelico (Brother Giovanni who is like an Angel).

The Italians usually call him il Beato Angelico (the Blessed Angelico). He has been called this for a long time, because he was thought to be blessed by God who gave him the talent of painting, and also because he was such a good and holy man. The name "Blessed Angelico" has now been made official, because in 1982 Pope John Paul II "conferred beatification" which means that he is now on the way to being made a saint.

Vasari says about him: "It is impossible to think of enough good things to say about this holy father, who was so humble and modest in everything that he did and said, and whose pictures were painted with such cleverness and holy faith."

[[624 Hektor]]

CATEGORIES: Trojan asteroids

624 Hektor is the biggest of the Jovian Trojan asteroids. It was found in 1907 by August Kopff.

Hektor is a D-type asteroid, dark and reddish in colour. It lies in Jupiter's leading Lagrangian point, L4, called the 'Greek' node after one of the two sides in the legendary Trojan War. Ironically, Hektor is named after the Trojan hero Hektor, and is thus one of two Trojan asteroids that is "misplaced" in the wrong camp (the other being 617 Patroclus in the Trojan node).

Hektor is one of the most stretched bodies of its size in the solar system, being 370 × 200 km. It is thought that Hektor might be a contact binary (two asteroids joined by gravitational attraction) like 216 Kleopatra. Hubble Space Telescope sightings of Hektor in 1993 did not show an obvious stretched shape because of a limited angular resolution.  On July 17, 2006, the Keck-10m II telescope and its Laser guide star Adaptive Optics (AO) system indicated a stretched shape for Hektor. Additionally, since this AO system provides an excellent and stable correction (angular resolution of 0.060 arcsec in K band), a 15-km moon at 1000 km from Hektor was found. The moon's provisional designation is S/2006 (624) 1.  Hektor is, so far, the only known binary Trojan asteroid in the L4 point and the first Trojan with a moon. 617 Patroclus, another big Trojan asteroid in the L5, is made of two same-sized asteroids.

In 1882 certain monasteries formed a new order, called the Trappists. With time, they split completely from the Cistercians.

Langston Hughes (1902 – May 22, 1967) was an American poet, novelist, playwright and short story writer. Hughes was one of the writers and artists whose work was called the Harlem Renaissance.

Hughes grew up as a poor boy from Missouri, the descendant of African people who had been taken to America as slaves. At that time, the term used for African-Americans was "negro" which means a person with black skin. Most "negroes" did not remember or think about their link with the people of Africa, even though it was a big influence on their culture and, in particular, their music. Hughes was unusual for his time, because he went back to West Africa to understand more about his own culture. Through his poetry, plays, and stories, Hughes helped other black Americans to see themselves as part of a much bigger group of people, so that now the term "African-American" is used with pride.

Hughes became a famous writer, but all his life he remembered how he started out, and he helped and encouraged many other struggling writers.

[[Geographic coordinate system]]

CATEGORIES: Coordinate systems, Geocodes

A geographical coordinate system is a coordinate system. This means that every place can be specified by a set of three numbers, called coordinates.

Today, degrees are divided further. There are minutes, and seconds; 1 minute (or 1') in this context is 1/60 of a degree; 1 second (or 1") is 1/60 of a minute.

The third number is the height, altitude, or depth. This is given with respect to some fixed (usually easily calculable point). One of these is called mean sea level.

[[Weighing scale]]

CATEGORIES: Basic English 850 words, Measuring tools

Scales are used to measure the weight of an item. To use a scale, the item which needs to be weighed is put on one side of the scale. Then, weight stones are put on the other side. Once the scale balances (that is the indicator between the two scales is in the middle), the correct weight is chosen.

There are also modern scales, where the item is simply put on the scale. Its weight can then be read from an electronic or analogue display. 

Weighting Scales are used to measure the weight of an item. To use a scale, the item which needs to be weighed is put on one side of the scale. Then, usually stones are put on the other side to compare the weight of the stone with the weight of the object you have chosen. If both cups are in the middle, it means that the weights of the objects are equal. If one cup is more up while the other one is down, it means that the one that is down is the heavier one. For example:  If you place a small stone in one cup, and a watch in the other cup, and the cup with the watch goes down and the stone obviously goes up, it means that the watch has a greater weight than the stone.

[[New Horizons]]

CATEGORIES: NASA spacecraft

New Horizons is a space probe launched by NASA on 19 January 2006, to the dwarf planet Pluto and on an escape trajectory from the Sun. It is the first man-made spacecraft to go to Pluto. Its flight took nine years.  It arrived at the Pluto-Charon system on July 14, 2015.  It flew near Pluto and took photographs and measurements while it passed. At about 1 kilobit per second it took 15 months to transmit them back to Earth.

Instruments include a  Long-Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI), a Ralph telescope of 75 mm aperture, an Alice ultraviolet imaging spectrometer, a Particle Spectrometer Suite  to study solar wind and particles, a student dust counter (VBSDC), and a Radio Science Experiment (REX)

The primary mission of New Horizons is to study Pluto and its system of moons. The secondary mission is to study any objects in the Kuiper Belt, if something became available for a flyby.

The space probe set the record for the fastest man-made object ever launched, with the Earth-relative speed of about 16.26 km/s, although, arguably, the Helios probes got a faster Sun-relative speed. It used a gravity assist from Jupiter to get its high speeds without having to burn as much monopropellant (weak rocket fuel) as needed to fly directly to Pluto.

On January 1, 2019 the probe flew by 486958 Arrokoth, a small Kuiper Belt object also called 2014 MU69  and nicknamed "Ultima Thule". Propellant is now scarce, but a target for a third flyby might be found. It will continue to report about its environment.

[[Kharijite]]

CATEGORIES: Islamic denominations

Shurat Islam, formerly known as Kharijites, was a branch of Islam. It was one of the three main branches of Islam, along with Shia Islam and Sunni Islam. Though, the branch has no followers today, the Ibadi movement is seen as a moderate current demonization of Shurat Islam. However, Ibadis reject themselves being Shuratis.

Initially, Muslims were divided into two groups, Sunni Muslims and Shia Muslims. After caliph Uthman's death, Ali and Muawiya I were having a war. At this time, the Shurati Muslims emerged, who did not pledge allegiance to Ali or Muawiya I. Rather than allegiance, Shurati Muslims decided to attack Ali and Muawiya I's followers.

Sometimes, the term Kharijite (or Neo-Kharijite) is also used for some Islamic terrorist groups. Examples of such groups are the Groupe islamique armé in Algeria, or the Takfir wal-Hijra in Egypt.

The word paladin was also used in 19th century Hungary and in the German Empire and United Kingdom during the early 20th century.

The IC50 is a measure of how  effective a drug is.  It indicates how much of a particular drug or other substance is needed to inhibit a given biological process (or component of a process, i.e. an enzyme, cell, cell receptor or microorganism) by half. In other words, it is the half minimal (50%) inhibitory concentration (IC) of a substance (50% IC, or IC50). It is commonly used as a measure of antagonist drug potency in pharmacological research. Sometimes, it is also converted to the pIC50 scale (-log IC50), in which higher values indicate exponentially greater potency. According to the FDA, IC50 represents the concentration of a drug that is required for 50% inhibition in vitro.

It is comparable to an EC50 for agonist drugs. EC50 also represents the plasma concentration required for obtaining 50% of a maximum effect in vivo.

The Thousand Islands Bridge is an international bridge that goes over the Saint Lawrence River. It connects the north part of New York in the United States with south east part of Ontario in Canada. It was made in 1937. Builders added parts in 1959.  The bridge goes over the edge that Canada and United States share in the middle of the Thousand Islands area. It gets its name from the name of the area.  The bridge is governed by the Thousand Island Bridge Authority, an agency that works around the world.

The bridge is actually not a single bridge. It is really a lot of bridges that go across parts of the St. Lawrence River, eventually connecting both sides. The south end of the bridge connects with Interstate 81, an interstate.  The north side of the bridge connects to Highway 137, a highway in Ontario. There is also an intersection with the Thousand Islands Parkway, a mini highway on the Ontario side.

Thousand Island Bridge Authority is doing a study to find out when the bridge will get to its working limits and how to make no waiting time on the bridge.

The international border is actually between Wellesley Island in the United States and Hill Island in Canada.

The bridge is actually much taller than it appears in the photograph to the right. The highest point is 150 feet above the water.

[[Siege of Orleans]]

The Siege of Orleans (1428 – 1429) was an important event in the Hundred Years' War between France and England. This was Joan of Arc's first success and the first big success for the French since the Battle of Agincourt in 1415. 

The city of Orleans was at an important place on the river Loire. The English controlled large parts of France when they started the siege, and Orleans was the last thing stopping them from attacking the rest of France. There was not much south of the river to defend the people who served Charles VII of France, so the English came close to joining their northern lands in France with the land they controlled at Aquitaine.

The siege started on October 12, 1428 and its only major action until Joan of Arc arrived was the Battle of the Herrings. She initiated several attacks that ended the siege on May 8, 1429 - nine days after her arrival.

[[Battle of Agincourt]]

CATEGORIES: Battles of the Hundred Years' War, 1415, 15th century in England, 15th century in France, October events

The Battle of Agincourt was fought on 25 October 1415 and was a major win for England against France in the Hundred Years' War. It led to several later English victories. Henry V of England led the English army and Constable of France Charles d'Albret led a larger French army. King Charles of France didn't engage because he was mentally unwell. Henry V was involved in hand to hand combat and was struck by an axe but his helmet saved him.    

The English longbow was an important weapon for killing and winning this battle. It was more powerful than the French crossbow and they had more of them. The majority of the army were bowmen. The English army used sharp wooden archer's stakes to protect the archers from French mounted knights. 

The English took prisoners but killed all except those of high rank. Overall the French lost 8000 men and the English lost 100 but historians are unsure of the actual numbers. The French mainly lost because they wore heavy armour and got stuck in the sticky mud at Azincourt (Agincourt).

[[Variety show]]

CATEGORIES: Television programs

A variety show is a show that features a variety of performing acts. These may include actors, musicians and singers, acrobats and jugglers, animal trainers, magicians, comedians, puppeteers, and other kinds of performers.

Ed Sullivan hosted a long-running variety show on CBS, from the 1940s to the early 1970s. The Smothers Brothers hosted a comedy/variety show in the late 1960s. Other performers hosted successful variety shows through the years.

Variety shows were a good "breaking ground" for new acts, in the early years of television. They were also useful to established performers, to give them steady work and regular exposure to audiences.

Interest in the format lessened in the United States during the 1970s. Dolly Parton tried to start a new variety show in the 1980s, but it did not last. Performance competition shows, like The Gong Show, Star Search, and today American Idol became the new breaking ground for performers.

The variety show format is still sometimes imitated by ensemble comedy programs. Television talk shows carry much of the spirit of variety shows, in offering a variety of entertainers to appear.

[[Siegessäule]]

CATEGORIES: Buildings and structures in Berlin, Landmarks in Germany, Monuments and memorials in Germany

The Siegessäule.ogg or Victory Column is a famous sight in Berlin.

It was designed after 1864 to remember Prussia winning the Danish-Prussian war. By the time it was finished on 2 September 1873 Prussia had also beat Austria in the Austro-Prussian War (1866) and France in the Franco-Prussian War (1870/1871). A bronze sculpture of Victoria was added. Victoria was 8.3 high and weighed 35 tonnes. Berliners like to give nicknames to famous buildings. They call the statue Goldelse, meaning something like "Golden Lizzy". She also has the nickname of "Chick on a Stick".

The column was built in the Königsplatz, now the Platz der Republik, in front of the Reichstag building. It had three blocks of sandstone decorated by cannons taken from the enemies in the three wars. In 1938 the column was moved to its present location, and a fourth ring, decorated with golden garlands was added.

Around the base are four bronze reliefs showing the three wars and the winning army marching into Berlin. They were made by four Berlin sculptors:

These reliefs were taken away in 1945. The French occupying army did not want to remind Germans about old victories. French president François Mitterrand returned the reliefs in time for Berlin's 750th anniversary of Berlin.

The monument is now on the Großer Stern (Great Star). Many roads meet here, so there are four tunnels under the roads to the monument, and it is possible to climb the steps inside the column and look out over Berlin. If the Nazis had not moved the column it would probably have been destroyed in World War II.

The column is in Wim Wenders' film Wings of Desire. In the film it is the place where angels meet. The golden statue on the column was in the music video to U2's "Stay (Faraway, So Close!)" and inspired Paul van Dyk's 1998 trance music hit, "For an Angel".

"El Ángel" in Mexico City looks a lot like the Berlin victory column.

The Victory Column is open every day: April-October 9:30am-6:30pm November-March 9:30am-5:30pm.

[[Church music]]

CATEGORIES: Christian music

Church music is music that is intended to be part of Christian worship in churches, chapels,  cathedrals or anywhere Christians meet to worship.  Church music is sacred (religious) music, but not all religious music is church music.  Some music may be inspired by religion, but it may not be church music.  For example, some songs are about religion, but they may not be church music.  Although it uses the words of the Requiem mass,  Verdi’s Requiem, was composed for performance in a concert hall.  Britten’s War Requiem was written for performance in a cathedral, but it was not meant to be part of a service of worship, so it would not usually be thought of as “church music”.

Church music has varied enormously during the history of Christianity as different churches kept changing their ideas about what part music should have in religious worship.  Most church music is based on singing.  Music written for church choirs mostly used the words of the liturgy (the words used in services).  The organ is the most important musical instrument in church music, although from time to time many other instruments have been used as well.

During  many periods in history composers writing for the church used traditional music rather than the newest fashions.  This was particularly the case in the early 17th century when composers such as Claudio Monteverdi often wrote in two different styles: the old style for church music (which, at the time, they called “stilo antico”) and the new style for secular (non-religious) music (which they called “stilo moderno”).

[[Respiratory system]]

CATEGORIES: Physiology, Respiratory system

The respiratory system, also called the gas exchange system, is the body getting rid of carbon dioxide and taking in oxygen.  Carbon dioxide, a waste product, goes out of the body.  Oxygen, which the body needs, comes in. The lungs are the main organ to do this. In other words, the process in which oxidation of organic compounds occurs in cell and energy is released is called the Respiratory system. 

The first step in this process is breathing in air, or inhaling.  Inhalation means bringing air rich in oxygen into the body.  Exhalation means giving out air rich in carbon dioxide from the body.  The second step is gas exchange in the lungs where oxygen is diffused into the blood and the carbon dioxide diffuses out of the blood.  The third process is cellular respiration, which produces the chemical energy that the cells in the body need, and carbon dioxide. Finally, the carbon dioxide from cellular respiration is breathed out of body from the lungs.

[[Internal combustion engine]]

CATEGORIES: Propulsion, Engineering, Motors, Motorcycles

An internal combustion engine is an engine in which combustion, or the burning of fuel, occurs on the inside. There are many kinds but the term often means the machine that Niklaus Otto invented. In this kind, fire makes pressure increase inside a sealed box (cylinder). The pressure pushes a rod which is attached to a wheel. The rod pushes the wheel and makes it spin around. The spinning wheel is attached to other wheels, such as four car wheels, with a belt or a chain. The engine is very strong and can make all the wheels move. 

Engines need oil to make them slippery or the moving parts would grind together and stick. Parts of a car engine are measured to 0.01 of a millimeter and some engine parts fit together very tightly.

Internal differs from external combustion where the fire is outside the engine, such as a steam engine. 

Most road vehicles use the internal combustion engine today, and most of those use the four-stroke engine. Another type of internal combustion engine is the Wankel engine.

Gas turbines are internal combustion engines that work continuously, not by strokes. Rocket engines and guns are internal combustion engines but they do not turn wheels.

The term was coined in the 1920s with the advent of nationwide radio networks, mass-circulation newspapers and magazines, although mass media (like books and manuscripts) were present centuries before the term became common.

[[Adobe]]

CATEGORIES: Building materials

Adobe is a building material made from soil and often organic matter. Adobe means mudbrick in Spanish. It can also mean any kind of earth construction. 

Adobe is one of the earliest building materials ever used. It is found all over the world. The techniques used in adobe construction have not changed since the 16th century in the Southwestern United States. Because they are not fired in a kiln they never become hard. They shrink and swell as the water content in them changes. Also, as they get wetter, they become weaker.

Adobe does not permanently stick to wood, metal or stone because it moves more than they do. This causes cracks and seperation from other materials. Stone is sometimes used as a foundation and wood for the roof. These are usually held in place by their own weight or the weight of the adobe pressing down on them. But adobe construction is cheap and the materials are usually easy to find.

Interscope Records is an American major record label. It is owned by Universal Music Group. The label was founded by Jimmy Lovine and Ted Field as a joint venture with Atlantic Records. One of the main features of the company was weak control over the musicians, which allowed them to freely implement their ideas in creativity. Already in 1993, a year after its founding, the label's profits recouped the $20 million invested in its opening. Until May 2014, the CEO of the company was Lovine, after which he was replaced by John Yanick.  

In 1992, Interscope acquired the exclusive distribution rights for the releases of hip-hop-specialized label Death Row Records, whose artists were the then popular rappers Tupac Shakur, Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg. Subsequently, due to the distribution of the gangsta rap albums by the company, the label was embroiled in significant conflict with members of the public. As a result, in 1995 Time Warner, owner of Universal Music Group, severed ties with Interscope, selling 50% of the shares to Field and Lovine for $115 million. In 1996, 50% of the shares were bought for $ 200 million by MCA Music Entertainment Group, later known as Universal Music Group.

[[Lake Enriquillo]]

CATEGORIES: Lakes of North America, Geography of the Dominican Republic, Biosphere reserves

Lake Enriquillo is a lake in western Dominican Republic, near the border with Haiti. Its Taíno name was Hagueygagon but, in colonial times, it had the name Jaragua Lake. 

It is in the Hoya de Enriquillo valley, a long valley between the "Sierra de Neiba", to the north, and the "Sierra de Bahoruco", to the south.

The lake has an area of 265 km², and its surface is around 44 meters below sea level, the lowest point in the Caribbean. There are three small islands in the lake: Isla Cabritos, Barbarita, and La Islita.

Only small rivers flow into the lake. The rivers that flow from the Sierra de Neiba always have water. Those rivers that flow from the Sierra de Bahoruco sometimes do not have water.

It is a salt water lake with a higher concentration of salt than the sea water because the rivers that flow into the lake are small and the evaporation of its water is high.

Many water birds visit the lake to feed, including flamingos. There are also American crocodiles and some fishes as tilapia. Because it is an arid region, the vegetation around the lake is poor with cacti and small shrubs.

The lake is part of the "Lago Enriquillo e Isla Cabritos National Park" and of the "Jaragua - Bahoruco - Enriquillo Biosphere Reserve".

The Battle of Crécy happened on 26 August 1346 near Crécy in northern France, and was one of the most important battles of the Hundred Years' War. The smaller English army won against the much larger French army. New tactics and weapons make this an important battle in the history of warfare because the English used longbows to win against French knights. The longbow was a faster weapon to fire than the French and Genoan crossbow and could send arrows farther than the crossbow could and with more force. Before this battle during the Middle Ages, knights had been the most important part of an army. Because of this change some historians call this battle the beginning of the end of chivalry.

[[Coffea]]

CATEGORIES: Rubiaceae, Coffee

Coffea (coffee) is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. Out of about 120 species, we make coffee from only two, Coffea arabica and C. canephora.

Coffea are shrubs or small trees, native to subtropical Africa and southern Asia. The seeds are called "beans" in the coffee trade. Beans from the two productive species are widely cultivated in tropical countries. Coffee is one of the world's major commodity crops and is the major export product of some countries.

The caffeine in coffee "beans" protects the seeds of the plant. It is a form of natural plant defense against herbivory. The fruits and leaves also contain caffeine, and can be used to make a tea called 'Coffee cherry tea'. The fruit is also used in many types of soft drink.

Several insect pests attack the plants and affect coffee production. 

Coffee is used as a food plant by the larvae of some Lepidoptera (butterfly and moth) species.

[[Arthur Schlesinger Jr]]

CATEGORIES: 1917 births, 2007 deaths, American historians, Pulitzer Prize winners

Arthur Meier Schlesinger, Jr., born Arthur Bancroft Schlesinger (October 15, 1917 – February 28, 2007), was an American historian and social critic. He was awarded the Pulitzer Prize. His work explored the liberalism of American political leaders, especially that of Franklin D. Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy, and Robert F. Kennedy. He served as Special Assistant and Court Historian to the President in John F. Kennedy's administration. He wrote a lot about the Kennedy administration. These writings have the title A Thousand Days.  

When the United States thought about invading Cuba at the Bay of Pigs, he was one of only two people who opposed the invasion. The other was William Fulbright. Schlesinger sat silent, except for a private memorandum to the president. He did this, because he did not want to undermine the President's desire for a unanimous decision. 

When it had become clear the invasion had failed, Schlesinger later wrote: "In the months after the Bay of Pigs, I bitterly reproached myself for having kept so silent during those crucial discussions in the cabinet room ... I can only explain my failure to do more than raise a few timid questions by reporting that one's impulse to blow the whistle on this nonsense was simply undone by the circumstances of the discussion."

Schlesinger contributed many things to liberal theory. He was mostly for the kind of liberalism Kennedy did. He was admired for his wit, scholarship, and devotion to delineating the history and nature of liberalism. Since 1990 he had been a critic of multiculturalism.

He popularized the term "imperial presidency" during the Nixon administration by writing the book The Imperial Presidency.

[[Mendelian inheritance]]

CATEGORIES: Classical genetics

Mendelian inheritance is a set of rules about genetic inheritance.

The basic rules of genetics were first discovered by a monk named Gregor Mendel in the 1850s, and published in 1866. For thousands of years, people had noticed how traits are inherited from parents to their children. However, Mendel's work was different because he did experiments on plants, and designed those experiments very carefully.

In his experiments, Mendel studied how traits were passed on in pea plants. He started his crosses with plants that bred true, and counted characters that were either/or in nature (either tall or short). He bred large numbers of plants, and expressed his results numerically. He used test crosses to reveal the presence and proportion of recessive characters.

Getting rid of malware can be difficult, even when using programs designed to remove it.

The term "malware" only refers to software that is made for malicious purposes and works against users' expectations — and so does not include applications that may do unintended harm due to some deficiency.

Matrixism is a syncretic religion (a religion that joins together all religions).

Matrixism uses this fact to make a connection to the history of world religion but the three Matrix motion pictures are Matrixism's Bible (prime book).

Matrixism has four beliefs called "The Four Tenets (rules) of Matrixism". The four rules are; 1) Belief in the prophecy of the One. 2) Use of psychedelics (mind expansion medicine) as sacrament. 3) Seeing the relative nature of the world. 4) Acting by the rules of one of the world's religions. For Matrixism April 19th is a holiday (special day) named Bicycle Day. November 22nd is another holiday for Matrixism named the Day of Remembrance and Reflection. Aldous Huxley, John F. Kennedy and C.S. Lewis all died on this day in 1963.

The sign for Matrixism is 赤, the Japanese kanji for the word "red". This sign was used in the computer game Enter the Matrix. The color is a reference to the "red pill", from the motion picture The Matrix, which is representative of being able to see that which is true. The word (sign) 赤 is also a Chinese word (character). In fact, the Japanese kanji is from a Chinese character.

[[Carbon footprint]]

CATEGORIES: Ecology

The term carbon footprint is how much carbon goes into the air because of something done by people or that is not done by nature. Doing something that burns fuel will make carbon dioxide gas (CO2).  It is the total amount of greenhouse gases produced to directly and indirectly support human activities, usually expressed in equivalent tons of carbon dioxide.  Just as walking on the sand leaves a footprint, burning fuel leaves carbon dioxide in the air, which is called a carbon footprint.  Total carbon footprint/emission would include energy emissions from human activities - that is, from heat, light, power and refrigeration and all transport related emissions from cars, freight and distribution.  

The words "carbon footprint" are often seen in the news. They are used with the word sustainability, which means that we can keep doing something without making something bad happen. That is, if there is too much of a carbon footprint, then there is no sustainability. People and businesses are often asked to think about how much carbon they are putting into the air, and how this changes the environment and maybe causes global warming. This is often said about traveling by airplane or by car, because burning fuel makes carbon dioxide gas.

[[Louisiana Purchase]]

CATEGORIES: 1803 in the United States, Thomas Jefferson

The Louisiana Purchase was a land purchase made by United States president, Thomas Jefferson, in 1803.  He bought the Louisiana territory from France, which was being led by Napoleon Bonaparte at the time, for 15,000,000 USD. First, the men sent to France were allowed to spend up to 10 million USD in order to buy New Orleans and, if possible, the west bank of the Mississippi River.  But then the French government said that for 5 million more dollars they would sell all of the Louisiana territory.  Thomas Jefferson approved the deal and used his constitutional power to sign treaties to buy the land. However, France did not control most of the land that was purchased. Because of that, the United States had to make other agreements with and payments to other governments and groups. The total amount paid for the Louisiana Purchase and all of these other agreements was about 2.6 billion USD.

Napoleon Bonaparte sold the land because he needed money for the Great French War.  The British had re-entered the war and France was losing the Haitian Revolution and could not defend Louisiana.  Thomas Jefferson took the French offer as an opportunity to make America larger, even if it meant going against his Republican principles of small government (some would say he exceeded his constitutional power by accepting the deal on his own).

The purchase added 828,394 square miles and doubled the size of the U.S..  This included all of the states of Oklahoma, Nebraska, Kansas, Iowa, Missouri, and part of the states of Louisiana, Texas, Minnesota, Colorado, New Mexico, Wyoming, Montana, North Dakota, and South Dakota. It also included a small piece of land that is now part of Canada.

The Louisiana Purchase gave the U.S. control of the Mississippi River and the port city of New Orleans, both of which were used by farmers to ship their crops and get paid. It also ensured that France and other European countries would not try to take the land. France only controlled small bits of the territory, so the new owners still had to take the land from the Native American nations that lived there.

The Lewis and Clark expedition explored the Louisiana Purchase and the Oregon Territory. They started from St. Louis. Their route traced the Missouri River.

In 1831, Reuter started to study at the University of Rostock, and in 1832 went to the University of Jena. At Jena he joined a Burschenschaft (nationalist students' club). In 1833 he was arrested in Berlin by the Prussian government. They could only prove he had worn the club's colours, but he was condemned to death for high treason. King Frederick William III of Prussia changed this to imprisonment for thirty years. In 1838 he was sent to a prison in Mecklenburg-Schwerin, and he spent two years in the fortress of Dömitz. Reuter was set free in 1840, when Frederick William IV became king of Prussia.

After his release from prison, Reuter started studying law again at the University of Heidelberg but had to leave and go back to Stavenhagen and help to run his father's farm. When his father died, he gave up farming, and in 1850 became a private teacher in a little town then called Treptow-an-der-Tollense in Pomerania. Here he married Luise Kunze, the daughter of a Mecklenburg pastor.

Reuter's first book was written in Low German. It was published in 1853. Three years later Reuter decided to give up teaching to become a writer, so he left Treptow and moved to Neubrandenburg.

Ut de Franzosentid and Ut mine Stromtid are Reuter's best books. In them he describes the men and women he knew in the villages and farmhouses of Mecklenburg. Ut de Franzosentid is set at the time of the fight against Napoleon. Ut mine Stromtid describes the revolutionary movement of 1848.

Ashoka (or Asoka) was India's great emperor of the Mauryan Dynasty of India who ruled from 268-232 BC. His name means "He who is loved by the Gods and who is friendly to everyone".

Ashoka is often cited as one of India's greatest emperors. After a number of military conquests, he reigned over much of present-day India. He fought a war with the kingdom of Kalinga in which there was said to be 200,000+ casualties. He conquered Kalinga (present-day Odisha) around 261 BCE.

Afterwards, shaken by his brutal victory, he decided to become a Buddhist and lead with peace, not war. To do this, he set up hospitals for animals and humans, created shaded and rested areas along roads for weary travellers to rest, and dug wells in villages. We know these things about his life through various inscriptions (writing) on rocks and pillars. Asoka also convinced people to follow Buddhists paths.

The national emblem of India and the "Ashok Chakra" are created by Ashoka. It's in the flag to keep a remembrance of him.

[[Puritanism]]

CATEGORIES: Puritanism

The Puritans were a group of English-speaking Protestants in the 16th and 17th centuries. Puritans thought that the English Reformation had not gone far enough. They also did not agree with some of the things the Church of England did.

King Henry VIII separated from the Roman Catholic Church in 1534 and established the Protestant Church of England.  This Church remained until 1553. Queen Mary returned the Church to Roman Catholicism until 1558 when Elizabeth I of England became Queen.  Since she was a Protestant many people were happy, but thought that the Church had not changed enough and was still too much like Catholicism.

A Puritan was any person who tried to become purer through worship and doctrine. The Puritans' way of life and set of beliefs were called Puritanism.  The most important parts of Puritanism were piety (obeying religious rules), dressing simply, and living a modest life.

The Puritans believed some of the same things as Calvinists and Scottish Presbyterians. All of these groups were devoted to the Bible and to being morally pure.

One of the Puritans' most important beliefs was that every person needed to understand the Bible in his own way. (This belief is shared among most Protestants.) Puritans tried to live by the Bible's teachings in every way. They tried to be morally pure in even the smallest ways. They also tried to be spiritually pure in every way. They thought that man existed for the glory of God. They believed that man's most important job in life was to do God's will (what God wanted). By doing God's will, man would be rewarded with happiness in the future.

Because they did not agree with the way the Church of England did things, the Puritans made reforms, or changes, in their own churches and societies. Some of the Reformed churches in Europe made similar changes. The Puritans made preaching very important. They used as little ritual and decoration as possible. Very often, sermons talked about Hell. One famous sermon is "Sinners in the hands of an angry god", by Jonathan Edwards, an important Puritan preacher. The sermon talks about God being angry with people for sinful behavior, and throwing them into the fires of Hell as a punishment.

Many Puritan groups emigrated to New England so that they could start their own societies there and practice Puritanism the way they wanted. Puritan beliefs and writings became very important in New England. One important work was Puritan John Bunyan's "The Pilgrim's Progress".

[[Dependent territory]]

CATEGORIES: Dependent territories

A dependent territory is a territory that is not fully independent or sovereign. They belong to a sovereign state, and are dependent on that state to some degree. There are varying degrees and forms of such a dependence. They are commonly distinguished from subnational entities in that they are not considered to be part of the state. A subnational entity typically represents a division of the country proper, while a dependent territory is a legally separate territory that enjoys a greater degree of autonomy.

As an example, Greenland is a dependent territory of Denmark, and Saint Helena is a dependent territory of the United Kingdom.

Most of these dependent territories were originally colonies, which often had no autonomy.

[[SOCKS]]

CATEGORIES: Internet, Computer protocols

SOCKS is an Internet protocol that allows one client computer to connect to another computer via a third computer (SOCKS server). SOCKS is an abbreviation for "SOCKetS".

When a direct connection between two computers (clients) is not possible for some services (e.g. HTTP, FTP, or chat protocols like MSN and AOL), a user can use these services via a so-called SOCKS server (routing).

Example: Bill wants to chat with Jane. Bill has a bad service provider who limits internet access. Bill's computer then connects to the SOCKS server, which is able to "chat" with Jane's computer without restrictions.

An HTTP proxy works similar to a SOCKS server, but is limited on routing HTTP traffic only.

Corsican (Corsu or Lingua Corsa) is a Romance language spoken on the island of Corsica (France), together with French, which is the official language. Similar languages are also spoken on the nearby island of Sardinia (Italy), in the city of Sassari and the istorical region of Gallura. Corsican is similar to the dialects of Central Italy, particularly in Tuscany. Corsican is spoken by almost 35% of people in Corsica.

According to its UNESCO classification, the Corsican language is now in danger of becoming extinct. The language is separated into two dialects, "Northern Corsican", spoken in the Bastia and Corte areas, and "Southern Corsican", spoken around Sartene and Porto-Vecchio. The dialect of Ajaccio has been described as in transition. The dialects spoken at Calvi and Bonifacio are like the Genoa dialect, also known as Ligurian.

In the Sardinian region of Gallura, including the town of Tempio Pausania, and on the island of La Maddalena "Gallurese" is spoken. The Corsican language is very important for the Corsican culture, because it is really rich in proverbs.

[[Steeping]]

CATEGORIES: Cooking methods

Steeping may mean:

One example is the steeping of corn, part of the milling process. As described by the US Corn Refiners Association, harvested kernels of corn are cleaned and then steeped in water at a temperature of 50 degrees for 30 to 40 hours. In the process their moisture content rises from 15% to 45% and their volume more than doubles. The gluten bonds in the corn are weakened and starch is released. 

The corn is then ground to break free the germ and other components, and the water used (steepwater), which has absorbed various nutrients, is recycled for use in animal feeds.   

[[Gluten]]

CATEGORIES: nutrition

Gluten /gloot-en/ is a composite of the proteins gliadin and glutenin. These proteins are found in the endosperms of some grass-like grains such as wheat, rye and barley. Gliadin and glutenin make up about 80% of the protein contained in wheat seed. As they are insoluble in water, they can be got by washing away the starch in the grain. Worldwide, gluten is an important source of food protein, both in foods prepared directly from grains with gluten in them, and as an additive to foods that are low in protein.

[[Octal]]

CATEGORIES: Numbers

The octal numeral system is a base 8 numeral system. It uses the numerals 0 through 7. The system is similar to binary (base 2) and hexadecimal (base 16). Octal numerals are written using the letter o before the numeral, for example, o04 or o1242. Octal numbers are also sometimes written with a small 8 to the lower right, as in 12428.

At one time, the octal system was used mainly for work with computers. It provided an easier way to work with binary numbers. As computers changed from using 24-bit systems to 32- and 64-bit systems, hexadecimal replaced octal for most uses. Certain groups, for example, Native Americans using the Yuki language in California and the Pamean languages in Mexico, also use an octal numbering system. They do this because when they count, they use the spaces between their fingers instead of counting the actual fingers.

[[Rubiaceae]]

CATEGORIES: Rubiaceae, Flowers

Gardenia is a genus of about 250 species of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. Gardenia can be found in the tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, southern Asia, Australasia and Oceania.

The genus was named by Carl Linnaeus after Dr Alexander Garden (1730-1791), Scottish-born American naturalist.

They are evergreen shrubs and small trees growing to 1–15 m tall. The leaves are opposite or in whorls of three or four, 5–50 cm long and 3–25 cm broad, dark green and glossy with a leathery texture. The flowers are solitary or in small clusters, white or pale yellow. Flowering is from about mid-spring to mid-summer and many species are strongly scented.

[[Frangipani]]

CATEGORIES: Gentianales

From Mexico and Central America, Plumeria has spread to all tropical areas of the world, especially Hawaii, where it grows so abundantly that many people think that it is native there.

[[Religious conversion]]

CATEGORIES: Religious conversion

[[Radical (Chinese character)]]

CATEGORIES: Chinese language

A Chinese radical (Chinese: 部首; pinyin: bùshǒu; "section header") is the part of a Chinese character used to list the character in a Chinese dictionary.  

The radical is usually a semantic indicator: a piece that gives hints to the reader about what the whole character means. Later, the term was given a second meaning, the 部首 (Pinyin: bùshǒu, Japanese bushu, Korean busu). This means  "section header", which refers to the place where a character is listed in the dictionary. 

Radicals are typically simpler characters, or different variants of simpler characters, which combine with other radicals to make a more complex character. People can only make so many unique ideographs for the huge number of words and morphemes that make up a language. Combining already existing ideographs together to form a compound ideograph is a very convenient solution to make many more words. While there are thousands of Chinese characters (well over 45,000) that exist, it is said that nearly all characters used in daily life are made up of just 214 radicals. 

One example of simpler characters combining to form a more complex one is the complex character 明 míng meaning "bright" or "tomorrow", which is made up of the radicals 日 rì meaning "sun" or "day" and 月 yuè meaning "moon" or "month", both of which are simple characters that can exist by themselves, and the putting together of sun 日 and moon 月 to make one character show that either the sun and moon pass before tomorrow comes, or that they are the bright objects in the sky that shine light on the earth. An example of characters with radicals that don't exist by themselves is the complex character 休 xìu meaning "to stop", “to cease” or "to rest", which is made up of the radical 亻, which is a variant of the simple character 人 rén meaning "person" or "human", though the variant never exists as by itself must therefore attach itself to another character to form a complete character, and the radical 木 mǔ meaning "wood" or "tree", hinting what a person might want to do after he/she ceases working (like lying on a tree). 

A more complex is the character 媽 mā meaning “mother” (shown right), in which the left part 女 nǚ meaning "woman" or "female"  happens to be the semantic component, and also the section header under which dictionaries list the graph. However, not all section headers function in a particular character as the semantic component. Some are based on phonetics, or hint as the character's pronunciation, like the right part 馬 mǎ meaning "horse" of the character 媽. Although the meaning of the character 媽 has no clear, obvious connection to a horse, 馬 is included to help the reader remember its pronunciation. Other section headers are merely chosen for convenience of finding the character in a dictionary, and play neither a semantic nor a phonetic role, like 二 èr "two" in 亞 yà "second" or "inferior",亅 jué (no meaning) in 了 liào "past tense marker", and 一 yī "one" in 丁 dīng "fourth". These two meanings of “radical” are not synonymous, though they may coincide in a particular example, causing a lot of confusion. (For clarity, both semantic component and section header terms are used here.)

The equivalents in cuneiform and Egyptian hieroglyphics are called determinatives.

Chinese character components, whether semantic or phonetic in role, are the building blocks for all Chinese Hanzi as well as in the derived forms of Japanese Kanji, Korean Hanja, and Vietnamese Chữ nôm and Chữ nho.

Since the Kangxi dictionary of 1716 was indexed using the 214 

Zìhuì section headers, the standard list thereof has remained unchanged. Section headers are foundationally important for the organisation and use of Hanzi, Kanji, and Hanja dictionaries.

[[Household Cavalry]]

CATEGORIES: Military

The British Household Cavalry, is an army corps (pronounced "core") of two regiments  of soldiers. Cavalry regiments, until the end of World War I, were always "mounted" on horses. Nowadays cavalry regiments are mounted on tanks. The British Household Cavalry is unusual because half of them are also still mounted on horses. The two Regiments of Household Cavalry, the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment, which parades with horses and the Household Cavalry Regiment, which has light armoured vehicles, are manned by equal numbers of soldiers from The Life Guards and The Blues and Royals both of which are part of the "Household Division". In Britain the "Household Division" has the special privilege of guarding the Sovereign and the Royal Household.  The term "Household Division" is used in all Commonwealth countries. 

In many other countries there are similar highly-trained army corps which guard the head of state and have ceremonial duties as well as operational military roles. Regiments of this sort can be found in Australia, Brunei, Belgium, Canada, Denmark and many other countries. But when speaking in English of the "Household Cavalry", the term generally refers to the "British Household Cavalry".

==The Life Guards and The Blues and Royals== 

In Britain there are seven regiments in the Household Division. They are generally referred to as "The Guards". Five of the Guards regiments are "infantry", which means that they are "foot soldiers" and are Foot Guards, and the senior two regiments are "cavalry" meaning they are first and foremost armoured soldiers who also have a ceremonial role "mounted" on horses for ceremonial duty. 

The British Household Cavalry is made of two regiments: The Life Guards and The Blues and Royals. They are the senior regular regiments in the British Army, with traditions dating from 1660. The Horse Guards, (as they are known, for short), have their barracks in Hyde Park Barracks in Knightsbridge in London and perform their principal duty of forming daily The Queen's Life Guard at a building in London which was formerly the headquarters of the British Army. There are always mounted guards on duty ouside the "Horse Guards" building in front of which lies the famous Horse Guards Parade where The Queen's Birthday Parade takes place. There, the daily ceremony of the Changing of The Queen's Life Guard takes place. (This is a different Changing of the Guard to the one at Buckingham Palace.) 

The Colonel-in-Chief of both Regiments of Household Cavalry is Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. The Colonel of The Life Guards is General Lord Guthrie of Craigiebank GCB, LVO, OBE. The Colonel of The Blues and Royals is Her Royal Highness The Princess Royal KG, KT, GCVO, QSO. (See below) 

The motto of both regiments is Honi Soit Qui Mal Y Pense (Shame on him who thinks evil of it). 

As military regiments, The Life Guards and The Blues and Royals have served in these places:

Camillo Berneri (also known as Camillo da Lodi; 1877, Lodi–May 5 1937, Barcelona) was an Italian professor of philosophy, anarchist militant, propagandist and theorist.

Berneri, a World War I veteran, University of Florence professor of humanities, and a member of the Unione Anarchica Italiana, fought always Fascists, and he started to fight fascism until 1926, when he was forced to escape from Italy and he went in France, then Switzerland, Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg, and finally the Netherlands. In all these countries, Berneri was frequently placed under arrest, and then often expelled, because he was an anarchist. When he was in these countries he wrote lot of anti-clerical and anti-fascist articles.

With Carlo Rosselli, Berneri organized the first troop (column) of Italian volunteers to fight in the Spanish Civil War against Francisco Franco. After months he became highly critical of the involvement of Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (CNT) members in the Popular Front government, and he sent a letter to Federica Montseny (Anarchist minister for Health in the government against fascism).

During the Barcelona May Days, as troop of Communist Party of Spain members (apparently under orders from Joseph Stalin) searched  and then murdered him. His body, riddled with bullets, was found during the night, near the headquarters of the Generalitat de Catalunya.

He was married to Giovanna Berneri and was father of Marie-Louise Berneri and Giliane Berneri. The children were anarchists as the father Camillo.

[[Scenario]]

CATEGORIES: Theater, Planning

In context with theatre and movies a scenario (from Italian, that which is pinned to the scenery) is a description of an event or series of actions and events. In the Commedia dell'arte it was an outline of entrances, exits, and action describing the story of a play that was literally pinned to the back of the scenery. 

Surviving scenari from the Renaissance contain little other than character names, brief descriptions of action, and references to specific lazzi with no further explanation. It is believed that a scenario forms the basis of a fully improvisational performance though it is also likely that they were simple reminders of the plot for those members of the cast who were literate. 

In the creation of an opera or ballet, a scenario is often developed initially to indicate how the original source, if any, is to be adapted.  This sketch can be helpful in "pitching" the idea to a prospective producer, director, or composer.

Scenarios are also used in policy planning, and when trying out strategies against uncertain future developments. Here the key idea is for the scenario to be an overview, a summary, of a projected course of action, events or situations. Scenarios are widely used by organizations of all types to understand different ways that future events might unfold.

[[Idol]]

CATEGORIES: Religious objects, Gods and goddesses, Worship

An idol is a religious item that represents a god. It can also mean someone who is admired by many people, like a pop idol. Idolatry refers to the worship of idols.

Christians disagree about what idolatry is. Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy see Christian art and icons as good, because they see Christ's Incarnation as having made images of God lawful.  However many Protestants regard much Catholic art as idolatry.

This is due to differences in the understanding of the Ten Commandments. "You shall have no other gods before me. You shall not make for yourself a graven image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth; you shall not bow down to them or serve them; for I the Lord your God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third and the fourth generation of those who hate me, but showing steadfast love to thousands of those who love me and keep my commandments." (RSV Exodus 20:3-6)

Islamic art is often based on Geometric abstraction or calligraphy to avoid idolatry, but Jewish art is somewhat broader. Hindus have murtis, a term often translated as “idols”.

One introduced species is the tilapia.  It is a fish that comes from warm freshwater areas of Africa, North and South America, India and Sri Lanka.  It has been taken to other areas because it is good for fish farming, and it also is a good pet for an aquarium.  When the fish is released into other parts of the world, it quickly takes over from the native fish.  It can do this because it breeds quickly, eats all the available food, and eats the eggs and babies of native fish.  This can cause the water to become so muddy, that the native fish cannot live.  Tilapia has been listed as one of the 100 worst introduced species.  A person owning or selling one in Australia could be fined up to AU$11,000.

An introduced species may have a great advantage over the native species.  They usually come in without the predators and parasites which they suffer in their old environment.  This allows them to have young quickly. Fire ants and Africanized honeybees became invasive insects in the 20th century.

[[Bunker]]

CATEGORIES: Fortification

Bunkers were built during the Cold War for important political people and for the general public because of the scare of a nuclear war.

[[Over-harvesting]]

CATEGORIES: Environmental issues, Ecology

Over-harvesting means taking more from the land (or sea) than it can replace. It includes extreme farming, grazing, fishing, and using fresh water. 

Over-harvesting is harmful in the long term. Forests or wetlands are hard to replace. Damage to nature hurts animals and humans. Most wetlands are damaged by overuse as a source of drinking water, and are sometimes drained to make farmland or land for building. A thriving and diverse ecosystem is destroyed. 

Over-harvesting also applies to animals. Population numbers may drop as a result, and species may become extinct. Overfishing is a typical example. Nowadays, you can only fish, shoot deer or birds at certain times of the year. The season when they mate, reproduce and lay eggs or have the young are protected. Areas of especial natural beauty or scientific interest are also protected. Taking bird eggs is also now against the law, at least in the United Kingdom.

One thing which acts against conservation is the overpopulation of the world. The greatest single reason why the world loses forests is that some people want the land for other purposes. A few people gain, but everyone shares the cost. This is called the tragedy of the commons.

[[Habitat fragmentation]]

Christopher "Kit" Marlowe (1564–30 May 1593) was a major dramatist, poet, and translator of English Renaissance drama. Swinburne has written that: "Marlowe is a Father of English Tragedy and the creator of English blank verse and therefore also the teacher and guide of Shakespeare." He is the best Elizabethan tragedian. He was born the same year as Shakespeare, or at least baptised, but lived only to the age of 29, when he was murdered in a brawl.

Marlowe was the son of a shoemaker in Canterbury. His intelligence won him scholarships, to King's School in Canterbury at age 15, and two years later to the University of Cambridge. Marlowe was well-educated; he earned a bachelor's degree in 1584 and a master's degree in 1587. 

Marlowe's plays were both popular and controversial, in his own era and later. His plays deal with disturbing subjects like devil worship (Doctor Faustus), homosexuality (Edward II), and anti-Semitism (The Jew of Malta). Marlowe is generally regarded as master of blank verse.

In addition to seven plays, Marlowe wrote one long poem, Hero and Leander, and one famous shorter poem, "The Passionate Shepherd to His Love."

Marlowe's death was also highly controversial. He was killed in a tavern brawl, stabbed in the head. Yet there is some historical evidence that he was a secret agent. Marlowe also was, or sometimes claimed to be, an atheist, at a time when atheism was a crime that could be punished by death. Some people have wondered if his death was connected with these other issues.

Uncertainty about Marlowe's death has led some people to believe that Marlowe faked his death and continued to write plays using the name "William Shakespeare." This is called the "Marlovian theory." In modern times, the changes were attempted to rename the theory in  "Derogation of the king."

[[Bass clarinet]]

[[Stone circle]]

CATEGORIES: Stone circles

A stone circle is an ancient monument. It is made of several standing stones, usually menhirs that are arranged in a certain way. Very often those stones form circles or ellipses. The number of stones can vary between four and 60. Very often, burial sites are in the circle, or nearby. There are about 1,000 stone circles and 80 stone henges in the Great Britain and Ireland. Most likely stone circles were used for rituals. They might also have been used as calendars; some stone circles are arranged so that certain stones are lit on special dates, such as the summer solstice.

[[Standing stone]]

CATEGORIES: Europe, Prehistoric buildings and structures, Buildings and structures, Archaeological sites, Neolithic

Standing stones or menhirs  are stones set into the ground vertically. They were put there by Neolithic people in the British Isles and Brittany, and they also occur elsewhere in the world.

There may be single standing stones, circles, lines or groups of them. Their dates are mostly from 4000 BC to 1,500 BC. Since Neolithic peoples did not have writing, we know little about their use. It is generally thought they had both practical (meeting place) and ceremonial or religious uses. Pottery that has been found near some of these stones suggest some of them in Europe belonged to the so-called 'Beaker culture'.

Their shape is generally uneven and squared, often tapering towards the top. Menhirs can be found across Europe, Africa and Asia, but they are most numerous in Western Europe; in particular in the British Isles (Great Britain and Ireland), and Brittany. There are about 50,000 megaliths in these areas. Standing stones are usually difficult to date, but pottery found underneath some in western Europe connects them with the Beaker people. They were erected as part of a megalithic culture which flourished in Europe and beyond.

Where they appear in groups, often in a circular, oval, henge or horseshoe formation, they are sometimes called megalithic monuments. These are sites of ancient religious ceremonies, sometimes containing burial chambers. The developments of radiocarbon dating and tree-ring calibration have added to our knowledge of their timing. In some archaeological sites, the remains of wooden henges can be found. Woodhenge was a henge and timber circle monument in the Stonehenge World Heritage Site in Wiltshire, England. It is 2 miles (3.2 km) north-east of Stonehenge.

[[Feldspar]]

CATEGORIES: Minerals

Feldspar is the name of a group of rock-forming tectosilicate minerals that make up as much as 60% of the Earth's crust.

Feldspar forms crystals from magma in both intrusive and extrusive rocks, and they can also happen as compact minerals, as veins, and are also present in many types of metamorphic rock. Rock formed entirely of plagioclase feldspar is known as anorthosite. Feldspar is also found in many types of sedimentary rock.

Feldspar is typically reddish or pale pink in color, and has a hardness of 6 on the Mohs scale, making it roughly as hard to scratch as glass.

There are two groups of feldspar, both made out of silica and aluminum:

[[Jörg Haider]]

Jörg Haider (26 January 1950 – 11 October, 2008) was an Austrian politician who was often called to be off right-populism ("rechtspopulist"). He was born in Bad Goisern, Upper Austria, and died near Klagenfurt, Austria.

At the age of 29 he became the youngest member of the Austrian parliament and in 1989 the Governor of Carinthia for the first time.

Haider lead the Freedom Party to great success so that in 1999 the party reached the second most votes with 27% behind the SPÖ with 33% and could form a coalition with the Austrian People's Party ÖVP (having for the first time only the third most votes) making Wolfgang Schüssel Chancellor of Austria.

Haider passed his leading position to other party members so that a coalition could take place and returned to Carinthia to work as Governor again.

In 2004 Haider was re-elected as Governor of Carinthia. One year later the leading members of the FPÖ as well as there party members in the government together with Jörg Haider (as their new head) founded a new Party, the BZÖ. In 2006 the BZÖ party reached the 4% (that time lead under P. Westenthaler) in the Austrian elections and so became part of the Parliament with 7 representatives. For the snap elections in September 2008 he was voted unanimity in his party for the leading position and ran as candidate again for the elections like back in the nineties. Surprisingly the party gained 10.7% and therefore could rise its seats 3 times now having 21 representatives under the lead of Jörg Haider. However Haider promised before the votes toke place too remain Governor as he would have only changed as of becoming Chancellor. There were possibilities to build a government with Jörg Haider as chancellor (Haider already achieved to form a coalition where the ÖVP under Schüssel with the 3rd most votes got the Chancellor) or at least the BZÖ represented in the government. For this a coalition of BZÖ with FPÖ and ÖVP was necessary, however Haider never got into this position.

On 11 October 2008, Haider died in a traffic accident near the town of Klagenfurt. He was returning home after an event that had taken place earlier. Many people living in Carinthia in reaction to his death, left public offerings as flowers, candles, cards and personal messages, Austrian singer and intendant Harald Serafin called the tragic death even an "Austro-Lady-Diana-Story".

[[Yagan]]

Yagan (c. 1795–11 July 1833) was a Noongar warrior who played an important part in early  indigenous Australian resistance to European settlement and rule in the area of Perth, Western Australia. 

Yagan was the son of Midgigoroo, one of the elders of the tribe who lived in the Perth area. Yagan was blamed for spearing cattle near the Swan River. There were not many cattle in the new colony and food was scarce. Yagan's taking of the settlers animals and food supplies was seen as a very serious crime. After a European was killed, the military started a search for Yagan. He was found after four months and sent to Carnac Island. He escaped after six weeks. One of the soldiers who had got to know him on Carnac Island, compared him to William Wallace.

Yagan's brother was killed in April 1833 while trying to steal flour from a cart. Yagan, Midgigoroo and several others attacked another cart and killed the drivers. They were declared outlaws, which meant they had no legal rights and could be killed by anyone. A reward of £30 was offered for their capture. Midgigoroo was soon captured and executed. Two months later, on 11 July 1833 a shepherd, William Keates, shot and killed Yagan. Keates was killed soon afterwards in another fight with the Aborigines, and his brother claimed the reward for the capture of Yagan. Yagan's head was cut off and sent to England for display. 

After a long search his remains were rediscovered in an unmarked grave in Liverpool and returned to Australia in 1997. On 10 July 2010, Yangar was reburied in Perth, at a site now called the Yagan Memorial Park. The park is on the site where Yagan was killed in 1833.

[[Perspective (graphical)]]

CATEGORIES: Graphics, Art

In graphic arts, perspective is the representation of how an image is seen by the eye. It is about how the angle and distance of a three-dimensional object is represented on a flat surface. To create a real scene, objects are drawn smaller to show that they are farther away from the person looking at the artwork. The dimensions of an object are also drawn differently depending where the line of sight is. The size of an object's dimensions along the line of sight are usually drawn shorter than dimensions across the line of sight. This is called foreshortening, and is used to create the appearance of three dimensions on a flat surface.

Landscape paintings have a horizon line. This line represents objects that are infinitely far away. They have shrunk, in the distance, like objects on the Earth's horizon. Changing the height of the horizon level changes the view point for the picture. A person lying on the ground and looking up would have a different view to a person on a ladder looking down.

[[Critical density]]

CATEGORIES: Relativity, Cosmology

Critical density is the value at which the Universe is at balance, and expansion is stopped.  This value is estimated as (1~3)×10^-26 kg/m³ and it’s calculated when you take the matter-energy density of the universe and divide it by the matter-energy density of the universe that is required to achieve that balance.

This is related to the cosmic density parameter in many ways; this term describes the ratio of the actual density value of the Universe to the critical density value.  If the ratio is one, then the Universe is at balance, and the Universe is flat and will expand forever. If the ratio is greater than one, then the actual density of the Universe is greater than the critical density, and thus the Universe will eventually become closed and will ultimately end up collapsing in on it self.  If the ratio is less than one, then the actual density is less than the critical density, and the Universe is open and expands forever in every direction.

[[Non-Euclidean geometry]]

CATEGORIES: Geometry

Non-Euclidean geometry is a type of geometry. Non-Euclidean geometry only uses some of the "postulates" (assumptions) that Euclidean geometry is based on. In normal geometry, parallel lines can never meet. In non-Euclidean geometry they can meet, either infinitely many times (elliptic geometry), or never (hyperbolic geometry).

An example of Non-Euclidian geometry can be seen by drawing lines on a ball or other round object, straight lines that are parallel at the equator can meet at the poles

[[Fair trade]]

CATEGORIES: Trade

Fair trade is a social movement which tries to help people who make things in developing countries. The movement helps people to work in better conditions and helps them get more money for what they make. These things give workers the opportunity to improve their lives and plan for their future, and they help reduce poverty. The movement also tries to keep the environment the same or improve the state that it is in. it is a way to help poverty

Fair trade helps people in developing countries sell to people in developed countries. Things that are sold in international trade include handicrafts and other manufactured goods, agricultural products such as grains, coffee, cocoa, sugar, tea, bananas, honey, cotton, quinoa, fresh fruit, chocolate, wine and flowers, and minerals such as iron and petroleum.

Merchandise that has fair trade status must be given a fair trade certificate. This says it follows rules about fairness to workers and the environment. This will mean the product can put the Fairtrade symbol on their packaging if they earn the certificate.

[[Solenoid]]

CATEGORIES: Electronic components, Electromagnetism

A solenoid is a 3 dimensional structure of wire. When this wire is wrapped around a metallic block in a coil and electricity is passed through it, it has some special magnetic properties. Electromagnetic induction makes it an electromagnet that can be switched on or off. The side in which the current appears to be passing clockwise, is the South Pole, and the side in which the current seems to be passing anticlockwise is the Northern Pole. The solenoid works just like a bar magnet, and therefore has many uses.  

This principle is used to create valves, among other things. Where the solenoid operates an electric switch, it is a relay. 

Pinball machines, vehicles and traditional door bells use solenoids.

[[Electronvolt]]

CATEGORIES: Units of measurement, Physics

The electron-volt or electron volt, symbol eV, is used to measure energy. It is defined as the amount of energy an electron gains after being accelerated by 1 volt of electricity. Joules are used often for energy measurement, but it is sometimes useful to use electron-volts for very small amounts of energy, such as that carried by a single subatomic particle. To convert joules into electron-volts, divide joules by the charge of an electron, which is about 1.602−19 coulomb.

E.g. 5 J = 5/1.602−19  5 J = 3.125-19 eV.

The electronvolt is often used in atomic, nuclear and particle physics. For example, the energy of photons can be measured by the voltage necessary to overcome their photoelectric effect.

Appanage is important to the history of France during the Middle Ages. The law said that when a king dies, his oldest son becomes the next king. Kings who wanted to give a younger son some land too sometimes created an appanage. Appanage was one way to keep a civil war from happening, if two or more sons wanted to fight each other to be the next king.

The younger son controlled the appanage as a duke and ruled almost like a king, except he could not sell the land. The ruler of an appanage could give it to his sons and grandsons, but eventually that part of the family would run out of sons and the land would go back to the king.

[[Bourgeoisie]]

CATEGORIES: Society, Sociology

Bourgeoisie  means a social class of people who own the means of production, making them in the upper or merchant class. Hence, all employers are bourgeoisie. Their status or power comes from employment, education, assets, or wealth and not from aristocratic (political) origin, as a lowly café or factory owner is bourgeoisie. 

The term is widely used in many non-English speaking countries as an approximate equivalent of middle class.   

As the bourgeoisie are not its opposing counterpart proletariat, they don't have to be a labourer doing menial work for money. And if they do any work that gets them money, then it's only because of the many proletariat people beneath them, who generated their wealth through their labour, of which the higher up bourgeoisie person took a cut (commission).

[[Social class]]

CATEGORIES: Anthropology, Socialism, Sociology

In sociology, Social class refers to the hierarchical distinctions between individuals or groups in societies or cultures.

There are various ways to divide classes. The working class do hard work for others. Where money is used, they are paid for it, but they seldom have much money. Where money is used little, as in feudalism, or not at all, as in the Inca Empire there are still classes.

Historians usually see two other groups - people who are rich or have a lot of influence, called the upper class, and all the remaining people who are in between, called the middle class.

Not all societies have social classes. Scientists have found no proof for hierarchical power structures during the Stone Age.

[[Black bread mold]]

CATEGORIES: Moulds

Black bread mold (Rhizopus stolonifer) is a common type of fungus. 

It grows and reproduces the same way that most molds do. In asexual reproduction, the mold makes spores inside a sporangium. When the spores are ready to leave and spread more mold, the sporangium breaks open and lets the spores float out. In sexual reproduction its hyphae touch the hyphae of another Rhizopus mycelium. When they fuse, they make round balls called zygospores. After some time, the zygospore makes another sporangium, which then makes spores. During this sexual  process, genetic recombination takes place, as with all eukaryotes.

The spores land on a place where they can turn into a new mold, and begin to grow. They very quickly start making hyphae, small tendrils that look like roots. Hyphae are not roots, but part of the mycelium. The mycelium is the main part of the mold, and grows inside the bread. Black bread mold grows fast when the temperature is higher than 15 degrees Celsius and lower than 20oC.

Black bread mold is found in all countries of the world. It is often found growing on bread and on soft fruits such as bananas and grapes. Because the mold spores are airborne, the mold can spread easily.

Gymnasts manipulate one or two apparatus: rope, hoop, ball, clubs, and ribbon. Rhythmic gymnastics is a sport that combines elements of gymnastics, dance, and apparatus manipulation. The victor is the participant who earns the most points, determined by a panel of judges, for leaps, balances, pirouettes, flexibility, apparatus handling, execution, and artistic effect.

Rhythmic gymnastics developed from other sports. It is influenced by group gymnastics, classical ballet, German apparatus work, and the Swedish free exercise method.

International competitions are split between juniors, under sixteen by their year of birth; and seniors, for women sixteen and over again by their year of birth. The largest events in the sport are the Olympic Games, World Championships, and World Cups.

Rhythmic gymnastics was officially recognized by FIG in 1963. The first time rhythmic gymnastics was in the Olympics was in 1984 in Los Angeles. That year, a Canadian gymnast called Lori Fung won the individual competition. In 1996, rhythmic gymnastics group competitions were added to the Olympics.

Ernst Heinrich Philipp August Haeckel (16 February 1834 – 9 August 1919) was an influential German zoologist, naturalist, and artist. He was also a philosopher and physician, but in those fields he is not regarded as particularly notable. He was an atheist. He left the Lutheran church in 1910. He is regarded as a pioneer of eugenics and Nazi eugenics in Germany.

Haekel was professor of comparative anatomy at the University of Jena, where he worked for 47 years, from 1862 to 1909. Haekel discovered, described and named thousands of new species, mapped a tree of life relating all life forms. He coined many terms in biology, including ecology, phylum, phylogeny,  stem cell, and the kingdom Protista. Haeckel promoted and popularised Charles Darwin's work in Germany and developed the controversial recapitulation theory ("ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny"). This clained that an individual organism's biological development, or ontogeny, parallels and summarises its species' evolutionary development.

The published artwork of Haeckel includes over 100 detailed, multi-colour illustrations of animals and sea creatures. As a philosopher, Ernst Haeckel wrote Die Welträtsel (1895–1899, The Riddle of the Universe, 1901), and Freedom in Science and Teaching to support teaching evolution.

Haeckel was a member of the nationalist and antisemitic Pan-German League (German: Altdeutscher Verband) and of the peace organization Verband für internationale Verständigung.

[[Lunar eclipse]]

CATEGORIES: Astronomical phenomena, Eclipses, Moon, Earth

A lunar eclipse is an astronomical phenomenon. It happens when the moon passes through the shadow of the Earth which can only occur during a full moon. Lunar eclipses happen about twice a year, unlike total solar eclipses that are sometimes more than a year apart. They can be seen from a much larger portion of the Earth compared to solar eclipses. Lunar eclipses can last for a few hours, but total solar eclipses last only a few minutes. 

During a lunar eclipse, the Moon looks red-brown. It may be thought that the Moon is completely black because of the Earth's shadow, but no. The reddish-brown color is because some of the Sun's light bends through the Earth's atmosphere and shines on the Moon. Refraction is greater for red light rays than for others, so red is what strikes the Moon.

Like solar eclipses, there are different types of lunar eclipses. There are total eclipses, where the moon passes completely through Earth's shadow and all of the moon appears reddish-brown. A partial eclipse occurs when only part of the moon passes through Earth's shadow and so only part of the moon appears reddish-brown.

Lunar eclipses are safe to view with just your eyes and also with telescopes.

CATEGORIES: Forms of government, Systems, Democracy

A parliamentary system of government means that the executive branch of government has the direct or indirect support of the parliament. This support is usually shown by a vote of confidence.  A balanced relationship between the executive and the legislature in a parliamentary system is called responsible government.

The separation of powers between the executive and law making branches is not as obvious as it is in a presidential system. There are different ways of balancing power between the three branches which govern the country (the executive (or ministers), the law makers and the judges).

Parliamentary systems usually have a  head of government and a head of state. They change after their terms are over.  The head of government is the prime minister, who has the real power.  The head of state may be an elected president or, in the case of a constitutional monarchy, hereditary.

Examples of a few countries which practice parliamentary systems are India, Italy, Japan, and Latvia to name a few. Parliament is different in every country.

The United States Geological Survey (USGS) is a scientific agency of the United States government. The agency is a part of the United States Department of the Interior. 

The scientists of the USGS study the landscape of the United States, its natural resources, and the natural hazards that threaten it. The organization has four major science disciplines: biology, geography, geology, and hydrology. The USGS is a fact-finding research organization. It has no power to regulate.

The USGS science focus is on seven "Mission Areas", (1) Climate and land use change, (2) Core science systems, (3) Ecosystems, (4) Energy and minerals, (5) Environmental health, (6) Natural hazards, and (7) Water.  

Administratively, it is divided into a Headquarters unit and six Regional Units.  Other specific programs include:

[[Pyroclastic flow]]

CATEGORIES: Volcanology

A pyroclastic flow, pronounced pie-roh-class-tick, (also known as a pyroclastic density current) is a flow of "lava", as commonly associated with volcanic eruptions. The flows are currents of hot gas, or tephra, during an eruption that sometimes causes rock falls. A cloud forms over the river of hot rock. This boiling column of superheated gas, sand, tephra, obsidian, and pumice can reach soaring temperatures of 1,000ºC and is from 450-700 miles per hour.

They are extremely dangerous and can be deadly.  

[[Mudflow]]

CATEGORIES: Volcanoes, Natural disasters

A mudflow or mudslide occurs when mud travels down a slope very quickly. Mudflows, which are like giant moving mud pies, happen when lots of water mixes with soil and rock. The water makes the slippery mass of mud flow quickly down. Mudflows happen most in mountainous places where a long dry season is followed by heavy rains. 

Mudflows of volcanic eruptions are the most dangerous, and are called lahars. A lahar is a type of mudflow or debris flow composed of a slurry of pyroclastic material, rocky debris, and water. The material flows down from a volcano, typically along a river valley. Lahars can move as quickly as 80km/h and are as thick as liquid concrete.

Lahars have several possible causes:

Lahars can occur without volcanic activity, if conditions are right for the collapse and movement of mud from existing volcanic ash deposits.

[[Class (programming)]]

CATEGORIES: Computer programming

Class and object are basic building blocks in object-oriented programming languages. A class is written by a programmer in a defined structure to create an object (computer science) in an object oriented programming language. It defines a set of properties and methods that are common to all objects of one type.  

For example, a class could be a car, which could have a color field, four tire fields, and a drive method.

Another related class could be a truck, which would have similar fields, but not be exactly the same as a car. Both a car and a truck could be a kind of a third class which could be called a vehicle class. In this way, the programmer could create the parts of the program that are the same for both the car and the truck in programming the vehicle class, yet the programmer would be free to program how a car is different from a truck without duplicating all of the programming.

In this example, there are three classes: 1) a class called "car", 2) a class called "pick-up truck", and 3) a class called "vehicle". These classes would be used to make objects. Although there is only one class called "car", there could be many objects that are created from the class called "car". And, although there is only one class that is called "truck", many objects of type truck could be created from this class. The "vehicle" class is actually general and there would probably not be any objects that were only of the class "vehicle". But a car would be a kind of vehicle and a truck would also be a kind of vehicle. So, you could say that both cars and trucks are from the same class, vehicle.

Inside of classes are two kinds of things: methods and fields (or properties). Methods can store the code for doing actions; in this example you could have a drive method and a brake method, and maybe a turnRight and turnLeft method. Fields store data; you could have a color field, a speed field and a size field. You can call methods by first making an object of the Car or Truck class, and call it for example ferrari, and doing ferrari.methodName(). In this case, if we wanted to make the vehicle move, we could do ferrari.drive().

Some loggerheads also live near other countries like Chile, Greece, and Indonesia.

[[Islamic Golden Age]]

CATEGORIES: History of Islam, Periods and ages in history

The Islamic Golden Age, also sometimes known as the 

Islamic Renaissance, lasted from the 8th century AD to the 13th century. It is regarded as starting with the reign of Harun al-Rashid. Some scholars think one should count even the 15th and the 16th centuries to this period.

This period was called Golden Age, because engineers, scholars and traders in the Islamic world did much for the arts, agriculture, economics, industry, law, literature, navigation, philosophy, sciences, and technology in this time. They built upon earlier traditions and added inventions and innovations of their own. Howard R. Turner writes: "Muslim artists and scientists, princes and laborers together created a unique culture that has directly and indirectly influenced societies on every continent."

[[Alhazen]]

CATEGORIES: 935 births, 1039 deaths, Astronomers, Engineers, Mathematicians, Philosophers, Physicians, Scientists

Alhazen or Alhacen or ibn al-Haytham (965–1039) was a pioneer of modern optics. Some have also described him as a "pioneer of the modern scientific method" and "first scientist", but others think this overstates his contribution. Alhazen's Risala fi’l-makan (Treatise on Place) discussed theories on the motion of a body. He maintained that a body moves perpetually unless an external force stops it or changes its direction of motion. He laid foundations for telescopic astronomy.

He was an Arab Muslim polymath who made contributions to the principles of optics, as well as to anatomy, engineering, mathematics, medicine, ophthalmology, philosophy, physics, psychology, Muslim theology, visual perception. He is sometimes called al-Basri (Arabic: البصري), after his birthplace in the city of Basra in Iraq (Mesopotamia).

Alhazen lived mainly in Cairo, Egypt, dying there at age 74. Over-confident about practical application of his mathematical knowledge, he thought he could regulate the floods of the Nile. When he was ordered by Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah, the sixth ruler of the Fatimid caliphate, to carry out this operation, he realized he could not do it, and retired from engineering. Fearing for his life, he pretended to be mad, and was placed under house arrest. For the rest of his life he devoted himself entirely to his scientific work.

[[Weather balloon]]

CATEGORIES: Weather

A weather or sounding balloon is a balloon (specifically a type of high altitude balloon) which carries instruments in the sky to send back information on atmospheric pressure, temperature, and humidity by means of a small measuring tool called a radiosonde. To get wind data, they can be tracked by radar, radio direction finding, or navigation systems (such as the satellite based Global Positioning System). 

The invention of the weather balloon started the age of remote sensing, the ability to collect information where there are no people.  Weather balloons are a major tool of atmospheric research. High altitude balloons have also been used by astronomers and cosmologists to take readings of certain particle frequencies or gather light readings free of excessive disturbance from Earth's lower atmosphere (troposphere).

The first observation balloon was launched immediately before the first manned balloon flight by Frenchmen Jean-François de Rozier and the Marquis d'Aalandes on November 21, 1783, for a pre-flight wind reading. Later, French meteorologist Leon Teisserenc de Bort (1855-1913) pioneered the use of weather balloons, handily proving their utility. With balloon-acquired data, he determined the existence of a lower level of the atmosphere, which he termed the troposphere or "sphere of change," where weather takes place. Since the 1930s, when radio tracking systems were invented, balloons have been used as complete floating weather stations, using such instruments as thermometers, barometers, hygrometers, cameras, and telescopes.

Many agencies use weather balloon flights to model the atmosphere and to make more accurate weather predictions.  They collect such atmospheric information as temperature , pressure, and humidity that can then be plotted on weather maps. Three-dimensional atmospheric modeling is also possible using weather balloons because the instruments they carry are able to provide data collected from several different altitude points.  Since they started, the long bags of helium have been carrying aloft increasingly sophisticated observation devices.  The take the science of weather observation literally to the edges of outer space .

Einsatzgruppen were a paramilitary group in Nazi Germany.  They were part of the Schutzstaffel (SS).  They helped make The Holocaust happen by murdering about 12 million people throughout Europe.  Almost all of the people they killed were civilians.

Sometimes, the Einsatzgruppen would kill only a few people at once.  Other times, they would kill thousands of people in a few days.  For example, at Babi Yar, the Einsatzgruppen killed 33,771 Jewish people in two days.

Most of the people the Einsatzgruppen killed were Jews.  They killed between 5 and 6 million Jews.p. 257   However, they also killed hundreds of thousands of Polish people, Soviets, and Roma people in Eastern Europe.

After Nazi Germany lost World War II, 24 leaders of the Einsatzgruppen were put on trial for war crimes and crimes against humanity at the Nuremberg Trials.  Sixteen were convicted.  Fourteen were sentenced to death, and two were sentenced to life in prison.  Other countries later tried four other Einsatzgruppen leaders, convicted them, and sentenced them to death.pp=274–275

[[Martin van Heemskerck]]

CATEGORIES: 1498 births, 1574 deaths, Dutch painters

Marten Jacobszoon Heemskerck van Veen or Maarten van Heemskerck (1498, Heemskerck – 1 October 1574, Haarlem), was one of the best known Dutch portrait and religious painters of the 16th century (1500s). He became famous for a series of coloured prints of the Seven Wonders of the World.

Marten van Heemskerck was born in the town of Heemskerck, near Haarlem in Holland. His father was a farmer. Marten was apprenticed to two painters  in Haarlem, but was called home by his father to help with the farm work. Marten ran away from home, and in a single day travelled 50 miles to the town of Delft. He found another master to teach him painting, but soon left him as well. He then went to Haarlem where from 1527-29 he worked with a painter called Jan van Scorel.

One of the artists who influenced Marten van Heemskerck at this time was Jan Mabuse who had travelled to Italy and had seen the paintings of famous artists from Florence and Venice. Marten began to copy the style of Mabuse's paintings. In 1532 he went to Italy and spent several years going from town to town, looking at the artworks and making drawings of what he saw.

The city that was to have the most influence on Marten van Heemskerck was Rome. He was very interested in the ruins left from the time of the Ancient Romans. He made many drawings of the ruined buildings and other things that he saw. His sketchbooks, which are now in a museum in Berlin are very important evidence for showing what Rome was like in the 1500s. One important building that he drew was St. Peter's Basilica which had been begun, but never completed.

The most famous artist who was alive at this time was Michelangelo. He was mainly a sculptor but he had spent five years painting the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. Like everybody else, Marten van Heemskerck thought it was amazing. He was so influenced by the figures that Michelangelo had painted that he designed a series of pictures called "Twelve Panels showing Strong Men from Mythology and Biblical History". Like the series of the "Seven Wonders of the Ancient World" they are well known as prints made from "engravings" (they are printed from a metal plate with the design cut into it).

When van Heemskerck was in Rome in 1536, he got work as a "scene-painter". This is like a person who paints the scenery in a theatre. Charles V had coming to Rome and was going to have a "triumphal procession". The streets of the city were decorated with archways for the emperor to pass under. Van Heemskerck worked with Antonio da San Gallo, Battista Franco and Francesco Salviati. The writer Giorgio Vasari saw some battle scenes that he painted and wrote that they were well composed and boldly painted.

He returned to the Netherlands and lived at Haarlem where he settled down and married twice. After that, he only left Haarlem for a short time, in 1572, to go to Amsterdam because the Spanish had invaded Haarlem. In 1540 became president of his Guild of Painters. He became a rich and well-known painter. When he died, he left some money in his will to be paid to a bridal couple who would get married on his tomb. This custom was believed to bring peace to the dead person. He also left some land to help an orphanage in the city.

Many works by Marten van Heemskerck can still be seen. They include "Adam and Eve", "St. Luke painting the Madonna and Child"  and a painting of Jesus in the museum in Ghent, Belgium. These pictures were done before he went to Italy. In the 1550's he painted several altarpieces which can be seen in the museums of Delft, Haarlem and Brussels, as well as lives of St. Bernard and St. Benedict.

[[Currywurst]]

CATEGORIES: German food, Sausage

Currywurst is a German dish.  It is made from a pork sausage (wurst), sliced and covered in a curry sauce (usually ketchup or tomato paste blended with curry) and generous amounts of curry powder. 

Currywurst is often sold as a take-out/take-away food, Schnell-Imbisse, at diners or "greasy spoons," on children's menus in restaurants, or as a street food.

thumb|Plaque at the site of Herta Heuwer's stallBerlin legend says that Herta Heuwer, from Königsberg, invented the currywurst sauce by experimenting at her stall in Berlin-Charlottenburg in 1949.

People from the Ruhr-area say that the sauce was accidentally invented by a sausage stall owner in Essen, who dropped a can with curry powder into some ketchup. 

Early in his career German pop singer Herbert Grönemeyer, raised in Bochum, wrote a song, in the Ruhr dialect, to currywurst.

Although Berlin claims currywurst as its invention and "national dish", all over Germany, there are more than 20 different types of currywurst.

[[Nuclear power plant]]

CATEGORIES: Nuclear power plants, Power plants, Nuclear energy

A nuclear power plant is a type of power station that generates electricity using heat from nuclear reactions.  These reactions take place within a reactor.  The plant also has machines which remove heat from the reactor to operate a steam turbine and generator to make electricity.  Electricity made by nuclear power plants is called nuclear power. 

Nuclear power plants are usually near water to remove the heat the reactor makes. Some nuclear power plants use cooling towers to do this. Nuclear power plants use uranium as fuel.  When the reactor is on, uranium atoms inside the reactor split into two smaller atoms.  When uranium atoms split, they give off a large amount of heat.  This splitting of atoms is called fission.  

The most popular atoms to fission are uranium and plutonium.  Those atoms are slightly radioactive.  The atoms produced when fuel atoms break apart are strongly radioactive.  Today, fission only happens in nuclear reactors.  In nuclear reactors, fission only happens when the reactors parts are arranged properly.  Nuclear power plants turn their reactors off when replacing old nuclear fuel with new fuel.  

There are about four hundred nuclear power plants in the world, with many in the United States, France, and Japan. Some famous accidents at nuclear power plants were the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan, 1986 Chernobyl disaster in Ukraine, and the 1979 Three Mile Island accident in the United States.  An Anti-nuclear movement in Australia opposes the making of any nuclear power plants in the country.

Quack is also the name for someone who is a phony. One way that people use this word is a "quack doctor". A quack doctor sells people bad medicine that does not make people feel better.

A quack can also mean a fake doctor who tries to sell his medicine to people when they do not really make you better which means they are fake.

[[American Airlines Flight 77]]

CATEGORIES: September 11 attacks, 2001 aviation disasters

American Airlines Flight 77 was American Airlines' transcontinental flight from Washington Dulles International Airport, in Dulles, Virginia to Los Angeles International Airport in Los Angeles, California. The flight flew every day in the morning on this route.  On September 11, 2001, the aircraft flying this route—a Boeing 757-223—was hijacked by five al-Qaeda terrorists.  The hijackers crashed the plane into the Pentagon on purpose.  The crash was part of the September 11 attacks.

The hijackers went into the cockpit and made the passengers move to the back of the plane less than 35 minutes into the flight. Hani Hanjour, one of the hijackers who was trained as a pilot, took over the flight. Passengers on the plane were able to make telephone calls to loved ones.  They also called people to tell them what was happening on the plane.  The hijackers did not know that passengers were doing this.

Barbara Olson, wife of U.S. Solicitor General Theodore Olson, was one of the passengers.

The aircraft crashed into the western side of the Pentagon at 09:37 EDT. All 64 people on board the aircraft, including the hijackers, died. 125 people in the building died as well. Dozens of people saw the crash. News sources began reporting on the incident within minutes. The impact damaged an area of the Pentagon and started a large fire. Part of the Pentagon collapsed. Firefighters spent days trying to stop the fire. The damaged areas of the Pentagon were rebuilt in 2002.  The fixed areas were able to be used again starting on August 15, 2002.

The 184 victims of the attack are honored in the Pentagon Memorial next to the Pentagon. The 1.93 park contains a bench for each of the victims.  The benches are put in order of the victim's years of birth.  These years range from 1930 (aged 71) to 1998 (aged 3).

[[Shoulder rest]]

CATEGORIES: String instrument construction

A shoulder rest is something which is used by people who play the violin or the viola. It may be made of wood, aluminium, carbon fiber or plastic. It appeared around the middle part of the 20th century. Usually, the shoulder rest attaches to the edge of the violin with "feet" padded with rubber tubing or made of soft plastic.

The purpose of a shoulder rest is to help the player to be comfortable holding the violin, which is held between the chin and the shoulder. It is a relatively recent invention, and though it is quite commonly used among modern violinists and violists, it is not universally used. Depending on body type and style of clothes, some musicians prefer no more than a thin sponge, a cloth or sometimes nothing at all under the instrument. It is important that the player can shift his left hand easily and freely to play in the higher positions without being afraid that he will drop the instrument, and without feeling the need to squeeze the instrument between his chin and shoulder as this will make the muscles in his neck very tight.

The shoulder rest must not be confused with the chinrest, which is the bit on which the player rests his chin.

[[The Quibbler]]

CATEGORIES: Harry Potter, Magazines

The Quibbler is a fictional magazine of the Harry Potter world. 

The Quibbler is written by Xenophilius Lovegood, father of Luna Lovegood. The magazine is meant to cause shock, and contains the strange opinions of Xenophilius. Luna believes in everything her father says and during the "Order of the Phoenix" she had lots of arguments with Hermione Granger about it.

The Quibbler often has articles about creatures that other characters believe to not exist. In Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, it published an interview between Rita Skeeter and Harry Potter. In this interview, Harry said that he had seen Lord Voldemort.

For most of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, The Quibbler writes positive views on Harry, and tells people to support him. However, after Luna is taken by the "Death Eaters" (supporters of Voldemort), Xenophilius turns against Harry and begins posting wanted signs for him in The Quibbler. When Harry visits him for information on the Deathly Hallows, Xenophilius turns him in to the Death Eaters. Harry narrowly escapes.

[[Camera obscura]]

CATEGORIES: Optics, Photography

Camera obscura is Latin for "dark chamber." It is the name given to a simple device used to produce images that would lead to the invention of photography. The English word for today's photographic devices is merely a shortening of this name to "camera".

At its most basic, the camera obscura is a simple box (which may be room-sized) with a small hole in one side, (see pinhole camera for details on how to build one). Light from only one part of a scene will pass through the hole and strike a specific part of the back wall. (The projection can be made on paper on which an artist can copy the image.) As the pinhole is made smaller, the image gets sharper, but the light-sensitivity decreases. With this simple apparatus, the image is always upside-down. By using mirrors, as in the 18th century overhead version, it is also possible to project a "right-side-up" image.

[[Camera obscura (disambiguation)]]

Camera obscura means "darkened chamber" to describe early devices for projecting an image on a screen, by use of a lens or a pinhole.

Camera obscura can also mean

[[Pinhole camera]]

CATEGORIES: Cameras

A pinhole camera is a camera without a conventional glass lens.  An extremely small hole in a thin material can create an image when all light rays from a scene go through a single point. In order to produce a reasonably clear image, the aperture has to be about 1/100th the distance to the screen, or less.  The shutter of a pinhole camera usually consists of a hand operated flap of some light-proof material to cover and uncover the pinhole.  

A common use of a pinhole camera is to capture the movement of sunlight over a long period of time. This type of photography is called Solargraphy. 

Pinhole cameras require much longer exposure times than conventional cameras because of the small aperture; typical exposure times can range from 5 seconds to hours or days.  

The image may be projected on a translucent screen for real-time viewing (popular for viewing solar eclipses; see also camera obscura).

Like other cameras, pinhole cameras make the picture upside-down.

== Invention of pinhole camera == 

Very early in history (as far back as 500 B.C.), Greeks such as Aristotle and Euclid wrote on naturally-occurring rudimentary pinhole cameras, for example light may travel through the slits of wicker baskets and the crossing of leaves  The ancient Greeks, however, believed that our eye emitted rays which enabled us to see. What enabled a much better understanding of the pinhole camera was the discovery that light enters the eye rather than leaving it. It was the 10th-century Muslim mathematician, astronomer and physicist Ibn al-Haytham who published this idea.
