[[Silhouette]]

CATEGORIES: Art

A silhouette is an image in outline only, usually filled in as black on a white background.

The inside of a silhouette is featureless.It differs from an outline. That shows the edge of an object in line form, but a silhouette is a solid shape. Silhouette images may be made in any visual artistic medium. The word was first used to describe pieces of cut paper, which were then stuck to a backing in a contrasting colour, and often framed.

Cutting portraits, generally in profile, from black card became popular in the mid-18th century. They were a cheap alternative to the portrait miniature. Skilled specialist artists could cut a high-quality bust portrait in a matter of minutes. Other artists, especially about 1790, drew an outline on paper, then painted it in, which could also be done quickly.

From its original graphic meaning, the term silhouette has been extended to describe the sight or representation of a person, object or scene that is backlit, and appears dark against a lighter background. Anything that appears this way, for example, a figure standing backlit in a doorway, may be described as "in silhouette".

[[Mental capacity]]

CATEGORIES: Medicine, Health, Law

Mental capacity in law is a term used to describe a person's ability to make decisions for themselves and to understand what those decisions will mean for them.

Sometimes, people who are unwell, such as those with illnesses which affect their memory (Alzheimer's disease or Dementia), those with learning difficulties, or who have mental health problems, may find themselves in a position where their ability to make decisions for themselves is questioned.  This may be because they do not understand that what they are doing is not good for them; they do not realise that it might make them ill or get them into trouble.

People can also lack capacity if they are unable to communicate in any way; for example, if they're in a coma or if they have severe brain damage.  In this case, it may be necessary for someone else, such as an advocate or a Judge to make decisions for them by making a court order.

In some countries, like the United Kingdom, laws exist which tell those working with people whose capacity might be in doubt, what they must do and how to decide if someone is capable of making their own decisions.  In the UK, this law is called the Mental Capacity Act (2005).  It lists 5 rules which must be used as a guide; in simple terms, they are:

This law also allows people who have capacity, to pick someone else to make their decisions for them, in the case that they can't do it themselves.

Supposing a person is unable to make decisions for themselves, what happens then? In the UK (and many other countries) there is a legal framework to make sure no-one takes advantage of the said person. It often consists of a physician or psychiatrist dealing with the person in question, a solicitor representing the person, and a solicitor representing the "public interest" (the state). Meetings are held at agreed times, say once every three months. The purpose is to make sure that decisions taken are in the person's interest.

[[Buruli ulcer]]

CATEGORIES: Infectious diseases

Buruli ulcer is an infectious disease caused by bacteria. These bacteria are related to the ones that cause leprosy and those that cause tuberculosis. The disease can be found in tropical regions, but is not limited to the tropics. It is common in Africa, Southeast Asia and Australia. Currently, it is unknown in what way the disease spreads. It often occurs in rural areas close to swamps, rivers, or lakes.  For this reason, vector organisms such as mosquitoes appear likely. 

There are different forms of thearpy: the most common one consists of a combination two or three different drugs, and removing the affected tissue. Simple tissue removal looks promising, when no ulcers have formed yet. The bacterium does not support temperatures above 40 °C. For this reason, some forms of therapy have included heating the affected skin parts above 40°C. This will kill the bacteria. First attempts suggest that after killing the bacteria, the ulcer will heal in several cases. Even 18 months after the treatment, the disease no longer shows. This means that the method can be tested on more people.

[[Special Operations Executive]]

CATEGORIES: Organisations based in the United Kingdom

The Special Operations Executive (SOE) was a British World War II organisation. It was officially formed on 22 July 1940 under Minister of Economic Warfare Hugh Dalton. It was formed by combining three existing secret organisations. Its purpose was to conduct espionage, sabotage and reconnaissance in occupied Europe  against the Axis powers, and to aid local resistance movements. Later there were also reconnaissance missions in  occupied Southeast Asia.

One of the organisations from which SOE was created was also involved in the formation of the Auxiliary Units, a top secret "stay-behind" resistance organisation which would have been activated in the event of a German invasion of Britain.

Few people were aware of SOE's existence. Those who were part of it or liaised with it sometimes referred to as the "Baker Street Irregulars", after the location of its London headquarters. It was also known as "Churchill's Secret Army" or the "Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare". Its various branches, and sometimes the organisation as a whole, were concealed for security purposes behind names such as the "Joint Technical Board" or the "Inter-Service Research Bureau", or fictitious branches of the Air Ministry, Admiralty or War Office.

SOE operated in all countries or former countries occupied by or attacked by the Axis forces, except where demarcation lines were agreed with Britain's principal Allies (the Soviet Union and the United States). It also made use of neutral territory on occasion, or made plans and preparations in case neutral countries were attacked by the Axis. The organisation directly employed or controlled just over 13,000 people, about 3,200 of whom were women.

After the war, the organisation was officially dissolved on 15 January 1946. A memorial to SOE's agents was unveiled on the Albert Embankment by Lambeth Palace in London in October 2009.

[[Piccolo trumpet]]

CATEGORIES: Musical instruments

The Picolo trumpet is a smaller version of the trumpet, that is also tuned an octave higher than the regular trumpet. Since the 19th century, regular trumpets have three valves. The piccolo usually has four valves. Note also that the piccolo trumpet is different from the pocket trumpet. A pocket trumpet has the same tonal range as a regular trumpet; it is just built differently (to be smaller). 

A piccolo trumpet has another characteristic tone, which can easily be distinguished from that of a regular trumpet. 

The piccolo was developed in the first quarter of the 20th century, mostly by Julius Kosleck. Kosleck used it to make it easier to play baroque music. Note however, that at the time of Johann Sebastian Bach, the trumpets had no valves; these were added in the 19th century. 

Piccolo trumpets could not establish themselves in Jazz music, but they are often used to play classical trumpet.   

The trumpet is a "noble instrument"; it is often used to play high-pitched notes. Such notes are easier to play with a Piccolo. Because of its construction, the piccolo cannot play the first octave of the classical trumpet.  

Like the regular trumpet, the piccolo is a transposing instrument.

[[Procoptodon]]

CATEGORIES: Macropods, Extinct species

Procoptodon is a genus of giant short-faced kangaroo living in Australia during the Pleistocene epoch.

P. goliah  was the largest kangaroo known to have  existed. It stood about 2 tall. They weighed about 200. Other members of the genus were smaller. Procoptodon gilli was the smallest of the genus, only about 1 tall.

They were browsers, not grazers like kangaroos today. They ate leaves from trees and shrubs. Their weight makes it likely that they did not hop as their relatives do today. A combination of climate change (cooling and shrinking of forest areas) would have reduced their natural habitat. Predation (hunting) by aboriginal humans probably happened.

Saltbushes were their main food source, so Procoptodon goliah relied on free-standing water to help process its salt-laden diet.

[[Microatoll]]

CATEGORIES: Ecology

A microatoll is a circular colony of corals, near the surface of the ocean. Because the top is not in the water all the time, the corals at the top are dead.

They are named for their resemblance to island atolls formed during the subsidence of volcanic islands, as originally suggested by Darwin (1842).

They have been used to monitor sea levels, in response to global warming. They have also been used to quantify and date changes in sea level in seismically active areas. Using microatolls, scientists were able to provide information about the water temperature at the surface of the sea.

[[Inupiat language]]

CATEGORIES: Alaska

Inupiaq or Inpuiat language is a group of dialects spoken by the Inuit. It is also called Alaskan Inuit. The name also refers to the people who speak the language. Outside Alaska, it it is also spoken on the Diomede Islands. People on Little Diomede speak it; people on Big Diomede spoke it. Big Diomede Island belongs to Russia, and is uninhabited since the end of World War II. The other speakers live in northern and northwestern Alaska, and part of the Northwest Territories. The Inupiat language is closely related to Inuit languages of Canada and Greenland. There are roughly 2,000 speakers in Alaska, and about 24.000 speakers in Canada. It is considered a threatened language with most speakers at or above the age of 40. Iñupiaq is an official language of the State of Alaska.

The name is also rendered as Inupiatun, Iñupiatun, Iñupiaq, Inyupiaq, Inyupiat, Inyupeat, Inyupik, and Inupik.

The main varieties of the Iñupiaq language are Northern Alaskan Iñupiaq and Seward Peninsula Iñupiaq. 

There are differences in the three big dialects, both regarding the sounds and the words used. Speakers of two of the three dialects usually understand each other, even though the forms and words used are different. As an example: tupiq means tent in the North Slope dialect, and house in Malimut. The north slope dialect uses iglu to mean house. Sometimes the difference is mostly in spelling: dog is written as qimmiq in North Slope and qipmiq in Malimut. The dialect on the Seward peninsula  is quite different, and speakers need some training to understand the two other dialects. 

The Iñupiaq language has been in decline since contact with English in the late 19th century. After Alaska became part of the US, many people from other parts moved there.  The children of Inuit families were often put in boarding schools far away: There they learnt English, but they lost most of  the Inuit languages their parents spoke, and the Inuit culture. This has led to a situation where only a small minority of Inupiat speak the Iñupiaq language. Several communities try to revive the language, though.

[[Leaf miner]]

CATEGORIES: Insects, Parasitism, Plant tissues

A leaf miner is the larva of an insect which lives inside a leaf and eats it. Most leaf-mining insects are moths (Lepidoptera), sawflies (Symphyta, a type of wasp) and flies (Diptera). Some beetles also do this.

Like woodboring beetles, leaf miners are protected from many predators and plant defences by feeding inside a leaf, eating its tissues. It eats only the layers that have the least cellulose. Also, when attacking Quercus robur (English oak), they feed on tissues with lower levels of tannin. Tannin is a chemical produced in abundance by the tree. It is not edible.

The pattern of the feeding tunnel and the layer of the leaf being mined shows what insect is responsible, sometimes even to the exact species. The mine often contains frass, or droppings, and the pattern of frass deposition, mine shape, and host plant identity show the species and instar of the leaf miner. A few mining insects feed in other parts of a plant, such as the surface of a fruit.

It has been suggested that some patterns of leaf variegation may be part of a defensive strategy used by plants. It deceives adult leaf miners into thinking that a leaf has already been preyed upon.

CATEGORIES: Establishments in Syria, 2012 establishments in Asia

Al-Nusra Front or Jabhat al-Nusra (جبهة النصرة), known as Jabhat Fatah al-Sham (جبهة فتح الشام) is one of the organizations fighting in the Syrian Civil War. Since July 2016, it has also been known as  Jabhat Fateh al-Sham (جبهة فتح الشام, transliteration: Jabhat Fataḥ al-Šām). It has also been called al-Qaeda in Syria or al-Qaeda in the Levant. They are a Salafist organization and want to create an Islamic state in the country.

The group announced its formation on 23 January 2012. The United States designated Jabhat al-Nusra as a foreign terrorist organization, followed by the United Nations Security Council and many other countries. It was the official Syrian branch of al-Qaeda until July 2016, when it became a separate organization. In early 2015, the group became one of the major components of the powerful jihadist joint operations room named the Army of Conquest, which took over large territories in Northwestern Syria. It also operates in neighbouring Lebanon. In November 2012, The Washington Post described al-Nusra as the most successful arm of the rebel forces.

In July 2016, al-Nusra formally separated from al-Qaeda and re-branded as Jabhat Fateh al-Sham ("Front for the Conquest of the Levant").

On 28 January 2017, following violent clashes with Ahrar al-Sham and other rebel groups, Jabhat Fateh al-Sham merged with four other groups to become Tahrir al-Sham.

According to spokesmen of a moderate wing of the Free Syrian Army (FSA),  in November 2012 Nusra had between 6,000 and 10,000 fighters, which was 7–9% of the FSA's total fighters. Commentator David Ignatius for The Washington Post described Nusra then as the most aggressive and successful arm of the FSA. The United States Department of State stated likewise: "From the reports we get from the doctors, most of the injured and dead FSA are Jabhat al-Nusra, due to their courage and fact they are always at the front line". On 10 December 2012, the U.S. designated Nusra a foreign terrorist organization and an alias of Al Qaeda in Iraq. That decision made it illegal for Americans to deal financially with Nusra. Days earlier, the American ambassador to Syria, R. Ford, had said: "Extremist groups like Jabhat al-Nusra are a problem, an obstacle to finding the political solution that Syria's going to need".

[[Marshosaurus]]

CATEGORIES: Theropods

Marshosaurus is a genus of medium-sized carnivorous theropod dinosaur. It was from the Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation of Utah and perhaps Colorado. This carnivore operated in the same territory as the larger and more famous Allosaurus. It was about 4.5 metres long and weighed 200 kg.

The Morrison Formation is a sequence of shallow sea and river delta sediments between 156.3 million years ago at its base, to 146.8 mya at the top. That puts it in the later Jurassic period. The area would have been rather dry, with distinct wet and dry seasons. The Morrison Basin where dinosaurs lived, stretched from New Mexico to Alberta and Saskatchewan. It was formed when the early Rocky Mountains started pushing up in the west. The deposits from their east-facing drainage basins were carried by streams and rivers and deposited in swampy lowlands, lakes, river channels and floodplains. This formation is similar in age to the Solnhofen Limestone Formation in Germany and the Tendaguru Formation in Tanzania. In 1877 this formation became the center of the Bone Wars, a fossil-collecting rivalry between early paleontologists Othniel Charles Marsh and Edward Drinker Cope.

[[Coherence (physics)]]

CATEGORIES: Optics, Electromagnetic radiation

Coherence in advanced physics is a phenomenon of electromagnetic waves.

In physics, two wave sources are perfectly coherent if they have a constant phase difference and the same frequency, and the same waveform. In such a case the waves plot as identical: their peaks and troughs occur at the same time, and they have the same amplitude.

Coherence is an ideal property of waves. It produces stationary (i.e. temporally and spatially constant) interference.

The idea has several distinct concepts. These are limiting cases which never quite occur in reality.  However, they allow an understanding of the physics of waves, and have become an important concept in quantum physics.

More generally, coherence describes all properties of the correlation between physical quantities of a single wave, or between several waves or wave packets.

[[Sovereign (British coin)]]

CATEGORIES: British currency, Gold, Coins

The sovereign is a gold coin of the United Kingdom, with a nominal value of one pound sterling. 

It has been struck from 1817 until the present day. it was originally a circulating coin accepted in Britain and elsewhere in the world. Now it is a bullion coin and is sometimes mounted in jewellery. 

A bullion coin is a coin struck from precious metal and kept as a store of value or an investment, rather than used in day-to-day commerce. The United Kingdom defines investment coins as "coins that have been minted after 1800, have a purity of not less than 900 thousandths and are, or have been, legal tender in their country of origin".

In most recent years, it has the well-known design of Saint George and the Dragon on the reverse—the initials (B P) of the designer, Benedetto Pistrucci, is to the right of the date.

The British government promoted the use of the sovereign as an aid to international trade. The Royal Mint took lightweight gold coins out of circulation. From the 1850s until 1932, the sovereign was also struck at colonial mints, initially in Australia, and later in Canada, South Africa and India. They have been struck again in India since 2013 for the local market. The sovereigns issued in Australia initially carried a unique local design, but by 1887, all new sovereigns bore Pistrucci's George and Dragon design. Strikings there were so large that by 1900, about 40 per cent of the sovereigns in Britain had been minted in Australia.

With the start of the First World War in 1914, the sovereign vanished from circulation in Britain, replaced by paper money, and it did not return after the war, though issues at colonial mints continued until 1932. The coin was still used in the Middle East, and demand rose in the 1950s, which the Royal Mint eventually responded to by striking new sovereigns in 1957. It has been struck since then both as a bullion coin and, beginning in 1979, for collectors. Though the sovereign is no longer in circulation, it is still legal tender in the United Kingdom.

[[Laban movement analysis]]

CATEGORIES: Dance, Notation

Laban movement analysis (LMA) describes human movement. It is based on the original work of Rudolf Laban, and many others helped to develop it. Its main and original purpose was to be a dance notation. Before film and video were developed, there was no way to record dance moves so that later dancers could use those moves. The transmission of dance from one generation to the next depended on older expert dancers teaching young dancers.

The problem was especially notable in modern dance, where the vocabulary of classical dance figures was expanded with almost no limits. Towards the end of his life, Laban extended his ideas into the movements workers made during physical work.

LMA draws from many fields including anatomy, kinesiology and psychology. It is used by dancers, actors, gymnasts and many other groups. However, it is fair to say that it is now largely replaced by video recordings. Also, it is not the only kind of dance notation, and not the only way human movement can be written down as a record for later generations. And, it was not the first such system. For example, in the 1680s Pierre Beauchamp had a dance notation system for baroque dance, and in 1887/8 Eadweard Muybridge started to use film to record human and animal movement. It is film and video which has transformed our understanding of motion, rather than dance notation. But in its field the Laban notation was notable.

Dance which has been reliably recorded on notation and perhaps backed up by video recording, can be and has been used to copyright choreography.

[[Ice planet]]

CATEGORIES: Types of planet

An ice planet is a theoretical type of exoplanet where everything is frozen. None has been found so far, but astronomers think they do exist.

They might have an icy surface of substances which are volatile on Earth, such as water, ammonia, and methane. Ice planets consist of a global cryosphere. They are bigger versions of the small icy worlds of the Solar System, like the moons Europa, Enceladus, and Triton, the dwarf planets Pluto and Eris.

Some ice worlds might have subsurface oceans, warmed by internal heat or tidal forces from another nearby body. Liquid subsurface water might provide habitable conditions for life. Microorganisms can produce nutrients using specific chemicals (chemosynthesis) that may provide food and energy for other organisms. Some planets, if conditions are right, may have strong atmospheres and surface liquids like Saturn's moon Titan, which could be habitable for exotic forms of life.

[[Rice flour]]

CATEGORIES: Flour, Rice

Rice flour is made from either white rice or brown rice. To make the flour, the husk of rice or paddy is removed. The raw rice is then ground to flour. 

Rice flour is a particularly good substitute for wheat flour, which some people believe irritates their digestive system. Rice flour is also used as a thickening agent in recipes that are refrigerated or frozen.

Many dishes are made from rice flour, including rice noodles and desserts like Japanese mochi and Filipino cascaron. Vietnamese banh canh uses rice flour and it is also used in making General Tso's chicken. In Chinese, it is called mifen (Chinese: 米粉; pinyin: mǐ fěn) Also it can be used in cooking, steamed, fried (fried rice noodlesChinese: 炒米粉; pinyin: chǎo mǐ fěn). Also it is used in other cuisine, such as galapong in Ilokano/Filipino, and pirinç unu in Turkish cuisine. It can also be used to make rice bread.

Brown rice flour can be combined with vermiculite for the cultivation of mushrooms. Hard cakes of colonised substrate can then be fruited in a humid container. This method is often (though not always) employed by growers of edible mushrooms. It is a very simple and low-cost method of growing mushrooms.

[[Ice giant]]

CATEGORIES: Astronomical objects, Solar System, Types of planet

An ice giant is a huge planet made mostly of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium, such as oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur. There are two known ice giants in the Solar System, Uranus and Neptune.

In astrophysics and planetary science the term "ice" refers to volatile chemical compounds with freezing points above about 100, such as water, ammonia, or methane, with freezing points of 273, respectively.

In the 1990s, it was realized that Uranus and Neptune are a distinct class of giant planet, separate from the other giant planets, Jupiter and Saturn. They have become known as ice giants. Their constituent compounds were solids when the planets were stuck together during their formation. Today, little of the water in Uranus and Neptune is in the form of ice. Instead, the water is a supercritical fluid at the temperatures and pressures inside them.

Ice giants consist of only about 20% hydrogen and helium in mass, as opposed to the Solar System's gas giants, Jupiter and Saturn, which are both more than 90% hydrogen and helium in mass.

[[English Chess Federation]]

CATEGORIES: Chess organizations

The English Chess Federation (ECF) is the governing chess organisation in England and is affiliated to FIDE. The ECF was formed in 2004, and took charge in 2005. It replaced the British Chess Federation (BCF), the governing body of chess in England from 1904 until 2005. 

It was suggested that the BCF should change its name because only England came under its jurisdiction. It did not administer chess in the other countries of the UK. The BCF did have a British dimension, since it ran the British Chess Championship. This is one of two important tournaments held each year in Britain (the other is the annual international tournament at Hastings).

From the 1990s there was a campaign for the BCF to become a company limited by guarantee, to bid for more sponsorship money.

At the start of the 2005/6 season the English Chess Federation was created, inheriting the BCF's assets and personnel. The former BCF still exists for legacy purposes, but its website was inherited by the ECF. The Scottish and Welsh Federations hold their own championships every year as they did before. Therefore the change does not make much difference to most players.

The situation in Ireland is more complicated. The Irish Chess Union since 1912 was the governing body for both the Republic and Northern Ireland. In 2005 the Ulster Chess Union broke away from the Irish Chess Union. These two groups were part of the original British Chess Federation, but are not in any way connected to the new English Chess Federation. All groups except the Ulster Chess Union are members of the International Chess Federation FIDE, and the European Chess Union.

In the game, players can earn "badges", each of which correspond to common techniques used in the production of fake news, such as polarization, conspiracy theories, discrediting, trolling, and invoking emotion. The goal is to build your own fake news empire and gain as many followers as possible while maintaining credibility. The game is loosely based on a psychological concept known as inoculation theory, where prior exposure and familiarity with common fake news tactics is thought to help confer resistance or mental immunity against fake news.

[[1811-12 New Madrid Earthquake]]

CATEGORIES: Earthquakes in the United States, 1810s in the United States, 1811, 1812, Articles on pre-1900 earthquakes

A number of earthquakes that happened near the town of New Madrid, in late 1811, and early 1812 are known as the 1811–12 New Madrid earthquakes today. The first of these happened December 16, 1811. It probably had a magnitude of 7.5-7.9 on the Richter scale. There also was an aftershock of magnitude 7.4 on the same day. Until 2018, they are the most powerful earthquakes to hit the contiguous United States east of the Rocky Mountains in recorded history. The earthquakes and the seismic zone of occurrence are named for the Mississippi River town of New Madrid. The town was part of the Louisiana Territory at the time. Today, it is in the US state of Missouri.

There are estimates that these stable continental region earthquakes were felt strongly over roughly 130000, and moderately across nearly 3 million square kilometers (1 million square miles). The 1906 San Francisco earthquake, by comparison, was felt moderately over roughly 16000.

Different American Indian tribes interpreted these earthquakes, and came to a consensus: the powerful earthquake had to have meant something. For many tribes in Tecumseh's pan-Indian alliance, it meant that Tecumseh and his brother the Prophet must be supported.

Even today, earthquakes happen in this area, known as New Madrid Seismic Zone (or NMSZ). Scientists estimate, that until 2050, there is a chace of over 90%, that quake with a magnitude of over 7.0 on the Richter scale occurs there. Arthur C. Clarke has written a story, called Richter 10, where he describes this scenario.

CATEGORIES: Cities in California, Settlements in Monterey County, California

Monterey is a city in Monterey County in the U.S. state of California. It is on the southern edge of Monterey Bay on California's Central Coast.  

It stands at an elevation of 26 above sea level, on a land area of 8.466. The 2010 census recorded a population of 27,810. Monterey had a big herring industry, which went bust because of overfishing. Cannery Row in Monterey was where the fish were packaged. 

Cannery Row was the setting of John Steinbeck's novels Cannery Row (1945) and Sweet Thursday (1954). Both were the basis for the 1982 movie Cannery Row, starring Nick Nolte and Debra Winger. It is also mentioned in Bob Dylan's song "Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands". Sea otters still dive for abalone shellfish

Pacific Biological Laboratories, a biological supply house, was located at 800 Ocean View Avenue (now 800 Cannery Row) from 1928 to 1948. It was operated by Edward F. Ricketts. He was the inspiration for several characters in Steinbeck novels. The laboratory is still preserved.

There is a variety of natural habitats in Monterey: the closed-cone pine forest has pines whose cones only open after a fire (this is called "seroteny"). The idea is that the seeds drop onto ground with few occupants, so have the best chance of developing into trees. Coast live oaks often grow nearby.

[[Swanscombe Heritage Park]]

CATEGORIES: Archaeological sites in England, Hominins, Tools

Swanscombe Heritage Park or Swanscombe Skull Site is a 3.9 geological Site of Special Scientific Interest Swanscombe in north-west Kent. The site has two Geological Conservation Review sites, and a National Nature Reserve.

The park is in a former gravel quarry, Barnfield Pit. The area was already famous for numerous Palaeolithic-era handaxes—mostly Acheulean and Clactonian artifacts, some as much as 400,000 years old.

In 1935/1936 work at Barnfield Pit uncovered two fossilised skull fragments. These fragments were the remains of Swanscombe Man. The bones were later found to have belonged to a young woman. The Swanscombe skull were early Neanderthal, dating to the Hoxnian Interglacial around 400,000 years ago.

They are one of only two sites in Britain which have yielded Lower Palaeolithic human fossils, together with the 500,000-year-old Homo heidelbergensis leg bones and teeth at Boxgrove.

The skull fragments were found in the lower middle terrace gravels at a depth of almost eight metres beneath the surface. Further excavations, carried out between 1968-1972 uncovered more animal bone and flint tools, and established the extent of a former shoreline that the bones were found on.

Most of the bone finds are now in the Natural History Museum in London, and the stone finds are at the British Museum. The other key paleolithic sites in the UK are Happisburgh, Pakefield, Pontnewydd, Kents Cavern, Paviland, and Gough's Cave.

Happisburgh, pronounced "Hazeborough", is a village and civil parish in the English county of Norfolk. The village is on the coast, to the east of a north-south road, the B1159. Its population is under 1,000.

This small place became a site of national archaeological importance in 2010. Flint tools over 800,000 years old were unearthed. This is the oldest evidence of human occupation anywhere in the UK. In May 2013, a series of early human footprints were discovered on the beach at the site, providing direct evidence of early human activity at the site. Rough seas had eroded the sandy beach. This uncovered some elongated hollows.

Sultan Firuz Shah Tughlaq (1309 – 20 September 1388) was a Turkic Muslim ruler of the Tughlaq Dynasty, who reigned over the Sultanate of Delhi from 1351 to 1388. His father's name was Rajab (the younger brother of Ghazi Malik) who had the title Sipahsalar. He succeeded his cousin Muhammad bin Tughlaq following the latter's death at Thatta in Sindh, where Muhammad bin Tughlaq had gone in pursuit of Taghi the ruler of Gujarat. For the first time in the history of Delhi Sultanate, a situation was confronted wherein nobody was ready to accept the reins of power. With much difficulty, the camp followers convinced Firuz to accept the responsibility. In fact, Khwaja Jahan, the Wazir of Muhammad bin Tughlaq had placed a small boy on throne claiming him to the son of Muhammad bin Tughlaq, who meekly surrendered afterwards. Due to widespread unrest, his realm was much smaller than Muhammad's. Tughlaq was forced by rebellions to concede virtual independence to Bengal and other provinces.

[[Alpine orogeny]]

CATEGORIES: Geography of Europe, Orogenies

The Alpine orogeny (sometimes Alpide orogeny) is the building of mountain ranges in central and southern Europe and west Asia.

This mountain-building phase started in the later Mesozoic era. It happened as the two large continents Africa and India (plus a smaller plates) moved north and collided with Eurasia. This happened at the end of the Mesozoic era, and is slowly continuing today.

So this slow collision sqeezed the Eurasian plates, and caused mountains to build from the western edge far into Asia. These are the mountain ranges of the Alpide belt. They include (from west to east) the Atlas, the Rif, the Baetic Cordillera, the Cantabrian Mountains, the Pyrenees, the Alps, the Apennine Mountains, the Dinaric Alps, the Hellenides, the Carpathian Mountains, the Balkan Mountains, the Taurus, the Armenian Highlands, the Caucasus, the Alborz, the Zagros, the Hindu Kush, the Pamir, the Karakoram, and the Himalayas.

The Alpine orogeny also led to more distant and smaller geological features such as the chalk hills in southern England and northern France (the 'Weald–Artois Anticline'). The remains of this can be seen in the chalk ridges of the North and South Downs in southern England. Its effects are visible on the Isle of Wight, where the chalk and overlying Eocene strata are folded to near-vertical, as seen at Alum Bay and Whitecliff Bay, and on the Dorset coast near Lulworth Cove.

The Alpine orogeny was the last of the three major phases of orogeny in Europe that made its geology. The Caledonian orogeny which formed the Old Red Sandstone continent was the first. The second was the Variscan orogeny. That was when Pangaea formed as Gondwana and the Old Red Sandstone continent collided in the middle to late Palaeozoic.

The 2018 lower Puna eruption, which began May 3, 2018 is an ongoing volcanic event on the island of Hawaii on Kīlauea while at the time day, faced a 6.9 earthquake. It caused outbreaks of lava fountains up to 300 high, lava flows and volcanic gas in the Leilani Estates on the island of Hawaii. 

As of May 6, 2018, the eruption has caused in the destruction of 26 houses. This volcanic event is the 62nd episode of the ongoing east rift zone eruption that began in January 1983.

On May 3, 2018, after a 5.0 earthquake earlier in the day, steaming ground cracks opened in Leilani Estate and began to spew lava, causing evacuations of the Leilani Estates and Lanipuna Gardens areas. The next day, May 4, the first two homes were reported destroyed in Leilani Estates from three erupting vents.

The Civil Defense Agency reported extreme levels of sulphur dioxide gas in the area, and Talmadge Magno, the Civil Defense Administrator for Hawaii County, stated that power lines had melted off the poles due to heat.

By May 25, 2018, over 20 fissures had erupted lava in or near the Leilani Estates and Lanipuna Gardens subdivisions, resulting in the destruction of at least 82 structures in lower Puna. The eruption forced the evacuation of about two thousand residents. 

The fissures had sent lava rivers that on May 19 buried part of Hawaii Route 137 and began flowing into the ocean. On May 29 the approach of lava forced closure of Hawaii Route 132.

By July 12, over 12.4 of land had been covered by lava flows. About 655 of new land has been created in the ocean. The official number of houses destroyed by the ongoing eruption reached 700 on July 9. The eruption was said to have stopped near August 15, 2018.

[[Long Valley Caldera]]

CATEGORIES: Calderas, Geography of California

Long Valley Caldera is a depression in east California next to Mammoth Mountain. The valley is one of the Earth's largest calderas, the result of a gigantic volcanic explosion. The valley is about 20 long (east-west), 11 wide (north-south), and up to 3000 deep.

Long Valley formed 760,000 years ago when a supervolcanic eruption released very hot ash that later cooled to form the Bishop tuff that is common to the area. The eruption emptied the magma chamber under the area to the point of collapse. The second phase of the eruption released pyroclastic flows that burned and buried thousands of square miles. Ash from this eruption blanketed much of the western part of what is now the United States. It is not expected to explode again in  such a manner.

The explosion released 600 cubic kilometres (140 cu mi) of material from vents inside the margin of the caldera. By way of comparison, the 1980 Mount St. Helens eruption released 1.2 cubic kilometres (0.29 cu mi). 

In April 2006, three members of the Mammoth Mountain Ski Area ski patrol died while on duty. All three died from suffocation by carbon dioxide when they fell into a fumarole on the slopes of the mountain while attempting to fence it off.

Panphagia is one of the earliest known dinosaurs. It is an important find which may mark the change of diet in early sauropodomorph dinosaurs.

[[Temptation of Christ]]

CATEGORIES: Gospels, Jesus Christ

The temptation of Christ is detailed in the Gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke.

After His baptism, Jesus went into the desert where he didn't eat for 40 days. Then He was temped by Satan who told him to change stones into bread. Jesus didn't do it even though he must have been hungry. He said that Man does not live by bread alone, but by the words that come from the Father's (God's) mouth. The devil then told Jesus to jump off the highest part of the Temple to show his power, since the Bible said that God would send angels to save Him.  Jesus replied that the Bible also says not to "test the Lord your God".  Then the Devil offered to give Jesus all of the World's kingdoms if Jesus would worship him.  Jesus replied that we should worship only God.  

All three temptations are recorded in each of the three Synoptic Gospels.  But the order in which they were told is different between the accounts.  Some scholars think the Gospel authors chose the order of the three temptations to make a particular point, not just because they were careless in telling the story.

[[Arc welding]]

CATEGORIES: Electricity, Metals

Arc welding is the most effective way of permanently joining metals. It melts the two metals being joined and fuses them together, effectively turning them into one solid unit.

Arc welding uses electricity to melt the metals and the welding filler by creating an electrical arc. An electrical arc is like a tiny lightning bolt that passes between two metals, generating intense heat that melts the two metals and the filler material, fusing them together.

Commonly used for ship building in WWII, this method of welding has become common for creating steel structures.

[[Colour theory]]

CATEGORIES: Color

Colour theory or color theory is a guide colour mixing and the visual effects of colour combinations. 

There are also definitions (or categories) of colours based on the colour wheel: primary colour, secondary and tertiary colours. Colour theory principles first appeared in the writings of Leone Battista Alberti (c. 1435) and the notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci (c. 1490).

The foundations of pre-20th-century colour theory were built around "pure" or ideal colours, as sensory experiences rather than the physical world. This has led to a number of inaccuracies in the colour theory principles.

There is a difference between the behaviour of light mixtures, called additive color mixing, and the behavior of paint, ink, dye, or pigment mixtures, called subtractive color mixing. The absorption of light by material substances follows different rules from the perception of light by the eye.

A second problem is the failure to describe the important effects of strong light. The appearance of colours reflected from a surface (such as paints or inks) is not the same as mixed colours of light. "Colours" such as browns or ochres cannot appear in mixtures of light. A strong lightness contrast between a mid-valued yellow paint and a surrounding bright white makes the yellow appear to be green or brown, while a strong brightness contrast between a rainbow and the surrounding sky makes the yellow in a rainbow appear to be a fainter yellow, or white.

Another problem is the tendency to describe colour too simply, for example as a contrast between "yellow" and "blue". Most colour effects are due to contrasts on the attributes that define all colours:

Thus, the visual impact of "yellow" vs. "blue" hues in visual design depends on the relative lightness and saturation of the hues.

Many colour theorists have said that three "pure" primary colours can mix all possible colours. They think any failure of paints or inks to match this ideal performance is due to the impurity or imperfection of the colourants. But any three real "primary" colours of light, paint or ink can mix only a limited range of colours, which is always smaller than the full range of colours we can see.

[[Shark finning]]

CATEGORIES: Fishing

Shark finning is the act of removing fins from sharks. It is mostly done when shark is still alive. The sharks are sometimes thrown back to the ocean after removing their fins but they are still alive. since they are unable to swim properly, they sink to the bottom of the ocean and die of suffocation or are eaten by other predators. Shark finning at sea helps fishing vessels in increasing their profit. It also helps to increase the number of sharks harvested, as they only have to store and transport the fins, which is the most profitable part of the shark; the shark meat is bulky to transport. Some countries have banned this practice and require the whole shark to be brought back to port before removing the fins.

Shark finning increased since 1997 largely due to the increasing demand for shark fins. It is used in shark fin soup and traditional cures, particularly in China and its territories. The International Union for Conservation of Nature's Shark Specialist Group say that shark fin trade is causing a serious danger to the shark population. It estimates of the global value of the shark fin trade range from US$540 million to US$1.2 billion (2007). Shark fins are among the most expensive seafood products, commonly sold at US$400 per kg. In the United States, where finning is not allowed, some buyers regard the whale shark and the basking shark as trophy species, and pay $10,000 to $20,000 for a fin.

[[List of twin towns and sister cities in Switzerland]]

CATEGORIES: Cities in Switzerland

This is a list of places in Switzerland having standing links to local communities in other countries. In many cases, these completely ceremonial associations, especially when formalized by the local governments, are called by the fallacious name of "town twinning" – though other terms, such as "sister city" and "partner town" are far more accurate. While most of the places included in this list are cities or towns, the list also contains villages, districts, counties, cantons, provinces, etc. with similar links.

The list includes twin towns and sister cities (Partnergemeinden, Partnerstädte, villes ou communes jumelles) of towns in Switzerland linked by a sister-city agreement (Städtepartnerschaft or Gemeindepartnerschaft; jumelage de villes) or friendship agreements (Freundschaft or amitié).

A few Swiss municipalities participating in projects arranged by the Swiss organizations Patenschaft für Berggemeinden (Parrainage suisse pour communes de montagne) are included. The program arranges sponsorships of municipalities in the Swiss Alps by other Swiss municipalities. The twinning may be a private initiative (e.g. between Zürich and San Francisco) or an initiative of the city  authorities.

In Nikah, both husband and wife are asked three times for consent to intercourse with witnesses so later on no one can claim rape.

[[Cuckoo bee]]

CATEGORIES: Bees, Parasitism

Cuckoo bees lay their eggs in the nests of other bees, rather like cuckoo birds. They are kleptoparasites, a term which means parasitism by theft. In this case the theft is of food stored for the host larvae.

Females of cuckoo bees lack the special long hairs which collect pollen. Also, they do not make their own nests. They often have reduced body hair, thick exoskeleton, and saber-like mandibles.

They enter the nests of pollen-collecting species, and lay their eggs in cells made by the host bee. When the cuckoo bee larva hatches it eats the host larva's pollen ball. If the female has not already done so, it kills and eats the host larva. In a few cases the invading female stays in the host nest and lays many eggs. Sometimes it kills the host queen and replaces her. Species like that are often called 'social parasites'. Some are referred to as 'brood parasites'. There is a whole subfamily of bees which do this, the Nomadinae (nomad bees).

The behaviour has evolved many times in bees. 16 times parasitism of social species has evolved (mostly in the family Apidae), and there are 31 lineages which parasitize solitary bees. Altogether there are several thousand species of kleptoparasites, a large proportion of overall bee diversity.

The House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC, or House Committee on Un-American Activities, or HCUA) was an investigative committee of the United States House of Representatives. 

The HUAC was created in 1938 to investigate alleged activities on the part of private citizens, public employees, and those organizations suspected of having communist ties. In 1969, the House changed the committee's name to "House Committee on Internal Security". When the House abolished the committee in 1975, its functions were transferred to the House Judiciary Committee.

The committee's anti-communist investigations are often associated with those of Joseph McCarthy who, as a U.S. Senator, had no direct involvement with this House committee. McCarthy was the chairman of the Government Operations Committee and its Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the U.S. Senate, not the House.

[[Orrery]]

CATEGORIES: Scientific modeling, Machines, 1704

An orrery is a mechanical model of the Solar System. It shows the relative positions and motions of the planets and moons. It is usually a heliocentric model.

The Greeks had working planetaria. The first orrery that was a planetarium of the modern era was produced in 1704.  One was presented to Charles Boyle, 4th Earl of Orrery – hence the name. They are usually driven by a clockwork mechanism. The globe in the centre represents the Sun, and a planet is at the end of each arm.

The first known orrery was the  Antikythera mechanism, variously dated from 60 to 150 BC.

[[Clockwork]]

CATEGORIES: Motors, Clocks

Clockwork means the inner workings of mechanical machines clocks (where it is also called a "movement". Also other similar mechanisms with a complex series of gears.

A clockwork mechanism usually has a clockwork motor. This has a mainspring, a spiral of metal ribbon.  Energy is stored in the mainspring by winding it up, turning a key attached to a ratchet which twists the mainspring tighter.  Then the force of the mainspring turns the clockwork gears, until the stored energy is used up.  The adjectives wind-up and spring-powered refer to mainspring-powered clockwork devices. These include clocks and watches, kitchen timers, music boxes, and wind-up toys.

[[Analogue computer]]

CATEGORIES: Computing, Engineering

Analogue computers are mechanical or electronic devices which solve problems. some are used to control machines. They were once the only way a machine could be controlled, and are still used in cases where digital computers are not the best choice. The abacus, a digital device also sometimes called a computer, was used by Babylonians in c. 2500 BC.

The earliest known analogue computer in metal was the Antikythera device. However, this was certainly not the first in other forms. Some people think that mental inventions count as analogue computers, such as the invention of the zero (Ancient Egypt 1700 BC). But in that case almost every invention by mankind would count as an analogue computer, and that is not really how the term is used.

Certainly the invention of the slide rule was important for calculations. They were developed in the 17th century by William Oughtred, after John Napier's work on logarithms. Slide rules are definitely mechanical calculating machines. They were the most commonly used tools in science and engineering before the 1960s/1970s.

For the industrial revolution the invention of James Watt's governor was critical, because it was a negative feedback control for large pumps and engines. In fact most analogue computers work with continuous data rather that discrete or digital data. They are like abstract models of the real world. An analogue engine models the critical aspects of the real engine.

[[Antipyretic]]

CATEGORIES: Analgesics, Biochemistry, Pharmacology

Antipyretics (æ, from the words anti- meaning 'against' and pyretic meaning 'feverish') are substances that reduce fever. Antipyretics cause the hypothalamus to ignore increases in temperature caused by prostaglandin. The body then works to lower the temperature, which results in a reduction in fever. These elevations alter the firing rate of neurons that control thermoregulation in the hypothalamus. Although fever benefits the nonspecific immune response to invading microorganisms, it is also viewed as a source of discomfort and is commonly suppressed with antipyretic medication. Antipyretics such as aspirin have been widely used since the late 19th century, but the mechanisms by which they relieve fever have only been characterized in the last few decades. It is now clear that most antipyretics work by inhibiting the enzyme cyclooxygenase and reducing the levels of PGE2 within the hypothalamus.

Most antipyretic medications have other purposes. The most common antipyretics in the United States are ibuprofen and aspirin. These are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) used mainly as analgesics to relieve pain, but which also have antipyretic properties. Acetaminophen or (paracetamol), is an analgesic with weak anti-inflammatory properties.

There is some debate over using medication to control fever. Fever is part of the body's immune response to infection. A study by the Royal Society found controlling fever causes at least 1% more influenza cases of death in the United States, which results in at least 700 extra deaths per year.

[[Heavy water]]

CATEGORIES: Water, Nuclear physics

Heavy water (deuterium oxide, 2, D) is a form of water based on deuterium.

It has a larger than normal amount of the hydrogen isotope called deuterium (2 or D, also known as heavy hydrogen). Ordinary water has the common hydrogen-1 isotope (1 or H, also called protium). This makes up most of the hydrogen in normal water. The presence of deuterium gives the chemical different nuclear properties, and the increase of mass gives it different physical and chemical properties compared to normal "light water". Heavy water is used as a neutron moderator in some nuclear reactors, such as CANDU reactors. It is a more efficient neutron moderator than regular water, allowing the use of unenriched uranium as fuel. Pure heavy water is not radioactive, because deuterium is a stable isotope, but heavy water that has been through a nuclear reactor is slightly radioactive.

The chemistry of heavy water is different enough that people, and most living things, cannot survive with heavy water in place of ordinary water. Small amounts are not toxic to people. It is common for people to drink several grams of heavy water for metabolic experiments without causing illness.

[[Racial profiling]]

CATEGORIES: Police, Law, Race

Racial profiling is a term which originated in the United States. The usual context is police stopping and searching citizens on the suspicion that they may have committed a crime. It is controversial because it is usually black citizens who are stopped and searched. In other countries  (for example the Middle East) religious and cultural differences may be the basis of police profiling. 

Int the USA profiling has been tested in the courts a number of times. Terry v. Ohio was the first challenge to racial profiling in the United States in 1968. This case was about African American people who were thought to be stealing. The police officer arrested the three men, searched them and found a gun on two of the three men. One of the men searched was convicted and sentenced to jail. The sentence was challenged on the grounds that the arrest violated the search and seizure clause of the Fourth Amendment. In an 8-1 ruling, the Supreme Court decided that the police officer acted in a reasonable manner, and with reasonable suspicion, under the Fourth Amendment. The decision in this case allowed the police to have discretion in identifying suspicious or illegal activities.

Darwinsaurus (meaning "Darwin's lizard") is an ornithopod dinosaur once wrongly described as Iguanodon.

In the early nineteenth century dinosaur remains were discovered near Hastings in East Sussex. These were first reported by Richard Owen in 1842. In 1889 they were referred to Iguanodon fittoni by Richard Lydekker. They were then assigned to Hypselospinus fittoni by David B. Norman in 2010.

In 2012 Gregory S. Paul named them as a separate genus and species. The type species is Darwinsaurus evolutionis. The generic name honours Charles Darwin for his theory of evolution. The first fossil described as Darwinsaurus is known from a partial skeleton.

Paul's decision is being challenged, and the present account may need be changed.

[[Arrow's impossibility theorem]]

CATEGORIES: Economics

Arrow's impossibility theorem, Arrow's theorem, or Arrow's paradox is a statement from social choice theory, named after economist Kenneth Arrow, who first described it in 1950: Suppose there is a vote, and voters have at least three different options to choose from. Each voter will then rank the options according to his or her preference. Arrow said, that in such a case, there is no way to convert these rankings into a  community-wide complete and transitive ranking while also meeting certain criteria.

Arrow demonstrated the theorem in his doctoral thesis. He  popularized it in his 1951 book Social Choice and Individual Values.  The original paper was titled "A Difficulty in the Concept of Social Welfare".

In short, the theorem states that no rank-order electoral system can be designed that always satisfies these three "fairness" criteria:

The Chicago Outfit (also known as the Outfit, the Chicago Mafia, the Chicago Mob, or The Organization) is an Italian-American organized crime syndicate based in Chicago, Illinois, which dates back to the 1910s. It is part of the American Mafia originating in Chicago's South Side.

The Outfit rose to power in the 1920s, under the control of Johnny Torrio and Al Capone and the period was marked by bloody gang wars for distribution of illegal alcohol during Prohibition. 

The Outfit did not have a monopoly on organized crime in Chicago, but they were by far the most powerful, violent and largest criminal organization in the Midwest. The Outfit's influence, at its peak, stretched as far away as California and Florida. Higher law enforcement attention and general attrition led to the Outfit's gradual decline since the late 20th century. 

From 1997 until his death in May 2018, the Chicago Outfit was believed to be led by John DiFronzo.

[[Pontiac's War]]

CATEGORIES: 1760s in the Thirteen Colonies

Pontiac's War (also known as Pontiac's Conspiracy or Pontiac's Rebellion) was an uprising of  Native American tribes against English rule in America. A few tribes, mainly  from the Great Lakes region, the Illinois Country, and Ohio Country started it in 1763. The cause of the war was that these tribes were dissatisfied with British poltics in the region. Warriors from other tribes joined the uprising, to help drive the English soldiers and settlers out of the region.  The war is named after the Odawa leader Pontiac, the most prominent of many native leaders in the conflict.

The British were among the winners of the French and Indian War, which lasted from 1754 to 1763. As a result, large territories in the region that were controlled by the French came under English rule. French and English politics were very different. 

The war began in May 1763 when Native Americans  attacked a number of British forts and settlements. They attacked, because they had been offended by the policies of British General Jeffrey Amherst. Eight forts were destroyed, and hundreds of colonists were killed or captured. Many people fled from the region. Hostilities came to an end after British Army expeditions in 1764 led to peace negotiations over the next two years. Native Americans were unable to drive away the British, but the uprising prompted the British government to change the policies that had provoked the conflict.

Warfare on the North American frontier was brutal: Prisoners were often killed. Civilians were often targeted.  Other atrocities were widespread. The population of Native Americans and British settlers had very little in common. In this conflict, this fact showed as ruthlessness and treachery. Contrary to popular belief, the British government did not issue the Royal Proclamation of 1763 in reaction to Pontiac's War. Because of the conflict,  the Proclamation's Indian clauses were applied more often, though. This proved unpopular with British colonists, and may have been one of the early contributing factors to the American Revolution.
