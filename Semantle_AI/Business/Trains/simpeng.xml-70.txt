Childress was later involved in social causes. She formed an off-Broadway union for actors.

When Childress' stage play Trouble in Mind was produced at Stella Holt's Greenwich Mews Theatre in 1955, it won an Obie Award for best Off-Broadway play in the 1955-56 season. That made Childress the first African American woman to win the honor.

Her next dramatic work, Wedding Band: A Love/Hate Story in Black and White, was completed in 1962. Its setting was South Carolina during World War I. It dealt with a forbidden and interracial love affair. For the scandalous nature of the show and the major realism it had, it was impossible for Childress to get any theater in New York City to stage the play. It wasn't until 1972 that it played in New York at the New York Shakespeare Festival. It was later filmed and shown on television, although many stations didn't want to play it.

Childress was born in Charleston, South Carolina. She later moved to New York. She died there of cancer at age 77.

Newar (n; नेवार; endonym: Newa:; नेवा:, Prachalit Script: 𑐣𑐾𑐰𑐵𑑅), or Nepami, are the historical inhabitants of the Nepal Mandala which consists of Nepa Valley and its surrounding areas in Nepal and the creators of its historic heritage and civilization.

Newar people have developed a division of labor and a sophisticated urban civilization not seen elsewhere in the Himalayan foothills.  Newar people have continued their age-old traditions and practices and pride themselves as the true custodians of the religion, culture and civilization of Nepal.  They are the historical inhabitants of the Kathmandu Valley and its surrounding areas in Nepal and the creators of its historic heritage and civilisation. Newars form a linguistic and cultural community of primarily Indo-Aryan and Tibeto-Burman ethnicities following Hinduism and Buddhism with Nepal Bhasa as their common language.  

The Kathmandu Valley and surrounding territories constituted the former Newar kingdom of the Nepal Mandala. Unlike other common-origin ethnic or caste groups of Nepal, the Newar people are regarded as an example of a nation community with a relic identity, derived from an ethnically-diverse, previously-existing polity. Newar civilization within it consists of various strands of ethnic, racial, caste and religious heterogeneity, as they are the descendants of the diverse group of people that have lived in Nepal Mandala since prehistoric times.

[[Earliest known life forms]]

CATEGORIES: Biology, Earth sciences, Evolutionary biology, Molecular biology, Prokaryotes

The earliest known life forms found on Earth are fossils of microorganisms in 3.46 billion year old rocks in Western Australia.  Life forms, as microorganisms, may have lived much earlier. The earliest time that life forms first appeared on Earth is unknown. Such life forms may have lived as early as 4.28 billion years ago, not long after the oceans were formed 4.41 billion years ago, and not long after the formation of the Earth 4.54 billion years ago.

A life form, or lifeform, is an organism that is living. Estimates of the number of species of life forms on Earth range from 14 million, to as many as 1 trillion species. More than 99% of all species of life forms that have ever lived on Earth are thought to be extinct. Life forms may be found everywhere on Earth. This includes underground, possibly at least 12 miles deep underground, and the deepest parts of the oceans. Life can be found at least 47 miles high in the atmosphere and, under test conditions, it survives the vacuum of outer space.

According to one researcher, "You can find microbes everywhere — are extremely adaptable to conditions, and survive wherever they are".

[[Mutation breeding]]

CATEGORIES: Botany

Mutation breeding or variation breeding is the process of exposing seeds to chemicals or radiation. This will increase the number of mutations in the seed. These seeds can then be crossed with other cultivars to get desirable traits. Plants created using mutagenesis are sometimes called mutagenic plants or mutagenic seeds. From 1930 to 2014 more than 3200 mutagenic plant varieties were released. 70 precent of these plants are direct mutants,thirty percent are the offspring of direct mutants. Crop plants account for three quarters of released mutagenic species with the remaining quarter are ornamentals or decorative plants.  Even though the   FAO/IAEA reported in 2014 that over 1,000 mutant varieties of major staple crops were being grown worldwide, it is unclear how many of these varieties are currently used in agriculture or horticulture around the world, as these seeds are not always identified or labeled as a mutagen or having a mutagenic provenance.

[[Theory of forms]]

CATEGORIES: Philosophy

The Theory of forms is a philosophical idea held by the famous Greek philosopher Plato. Plato believed that behind every single thing in our world there is a form, which is the true eternal essence of that thing. We can explain this view with an example. In the world there are many different horses: big horses and small horses, grey horses and white horses, old horses and young horses and so forth.  According to Plato each horse is an imperfect copy of the horse 'form', the one true horse. In other words, they are all imitations of the perfect horse. Plato uses shadows as an analogy: Like a tree forms a shadow, so is the tree itself a shadow of the 'form', the one true tree. The Theory of forms applies not only to physical objects but also to abstract concepts such as beauty, anger, good and evil.

Plato also explains that it is impossible for us to perceive these forms through our senses, like our sense of hearing or sense of seeing. The only way we can truly understand a form is through the use of logic and mathematics. Through mathematics, we have discovered the form of the triangle: a polygon with 3 sides. However we will never be able to truly see with our eyes such a triangle. Even if we tried to draw it on a whiteboard with a ruler, it's lines will never be perfectly straight and two-dimensional.

[[Transclusion]]

CATEGORIES: Computer programming

Transclusion is a way to use content from one electronic document, in another document without having to copy the content from one to the other. If the original content is changed, the change will automatically show in the article that is using the trancluded content. The two documents are connected by hypertext. The word is a combination of trans, meaning across and inclusion, so it means including something that is brought across from another place.

On Wikipedia, this is usually used for putting content from a special article called a template into other articles, but the method also works for other kinds of article.

When you put the double braces  around a page name, the program reading the wiki source code and converting it to HTML so it will display on a browser. Software will see that you wish to add the content of the named page at that point, and will go read it, convert it to html and add it at that point before continuing with converting the rest of the source code of the original page to html. That is transclusion. You refer to the page to be transcluded by naming it in braces, which is called referencing. 

There are ways to exclude parts of the transcluded page, and ways to transclude part of a page, like just a section, but that does not change the basic concept. 

A transcluded page may also include transclusions of other pages. This is called nesting. It can be done a moderate number of times, with one page transcluding others, which may each tranclude others, again and again. There is a limit to how many levels of transclusion are allowed to prevent accidental or intentional infinite loops, which will cause the translating program to get stuck.

[[Bootleg recording]]

CATEGORIES: Property crimes, Copyright

A bootleg recording is an audio or video recording of a performance or song by an artist which was not officially released by the artist. The process of distributing or making such recordings is called bootlegging. 

Recordings may be copied and traded between fans of an artist without profit. But some bootleggers have sold recordings for profit. They sometimes add professional-quality sound engineering and/or packaging to the raw material.

Bootlegs are usually made of either unreleased studio recordings, live performances or interviews with a level of quality that can't be predicted.

Bootlegging dates back to the 16th and 17th centuries, around the time of William Shakespeare.

In the early 20th century, movie soundtracks were often bootlegged. One example was a bootleg of Judy Garland. She performed Annie Get Your Gun. That was before Betty Hutton replaced her early in production. It happened after a full soundtrack had been recorded.

Bootlegging increased between the 1960s and 2000s. One of the most praised bootlegs in the 1980s is Prince's studio album The Black Album. In December 1987, Prince ordered the album taken down because of a few advance copies being used to make bootlegs.

The rise in popularity of the video sharing website YouTube caused it to be a major carrier of bootleg recordings. Its owner, Google, believes that under the "safe harbor" rule of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), it cannot be held responsible for content. That allows bootleg media to be hosted on it without any fear of a lawsuit. In 2010 Youtube removed a 15-minute limit on videos. That allowed entire concerts to be uploaded by fans and bootleggers.

[[Khas Rajput]]

CATEGORIES: History of India, Rajputs

Khas Rajput (Devanagari: खस राजपूत) is a Rajput (warrior-ruler) community among Khas people. The term is popularly denoted to Khas people who follow Hindu Kshatriya tradition in the Indian state of Uttarakhand. It is used very less in Nepal and is replaced by the term  Kshetri.

They have been connected to the  Khasas mentioned in the ancient Hindu literature. Historian Bal Krishna Sharma and Dor Bahadur Bista speculates that the Khas people were of Indo-European origin. Historian Baburam Acharya speculates that Khas are a sub-clan of Aiḍa, an Arya clan originated at Idavritt (modern day Kashmir).  Khas were living in the Idavaritt in the 3rd millennium B.C.E. and the original meaning of the term Khas was Raja or Kshatriya (Yoddha). He further speculates that Kashmir has been named from its local residents Khas as Khasmir. In the 2nd millennium B.C.E., one group of Khas migrated towards Iran while the other group migrated east of Sutlej river settling only in the hill regions up to Bheri River. Historian Balkrishna Pokhrel contends that Khas were not the Vedic Aryans but Aryans of latter period like the Gurjara, Darada, Shaka, Pallava and Pisacha. He further asserts that post-Vedic Aryans were akin to Vedic Aryans in terms of language and culture.

It was basically a longer version of Douglas’s earlier airplane, the DC-2. It was revolutionary to the airplane market when the DC-3 started being built in 1936, as it could fly farther than most aircraft at the time.

During WW2, a military version of the DC-3 known as the C-47 “Skytrain” was the primary transport of the US Military. It was used in major events like D-Day.

[[Vowel length]]

CATEGORIES: Linguistics

Vowel length is a feature in languages when how long a vowel is spoken in a word can create a completely different word. Although this is a feature in many languages like Japanese, Arabic, Hawaiian, Classical Latin, and Thai, there are also many languages that do not have this feature. 

An example of this would be the Japanese words chizu, which has a short vowel (a vowel spoken for a short time), and chīzu, which has a long vowel (a vowel spoken for a long time). The only difference that can be heard is how long the vowel "I" is spoken. The amount of time the vowel is spoken could create two entirely different words. Chizu means "map", while chīzu "cheese". 

When using IPA, the colon (:) is used to show that the vowel before it is a long vowel. For example, chizu in IPA is written as /t͡ɕizɯ/, but chīzu is written as /t͡ɕi:zɯ/.

While Old English had vowel lengthening, most modern dialects of English do not. For example, the words God and good used to have the same vowel sound, but the vowel in good (/go:d/), which was a long vowel, was said longer than it was in God (/god/), which was a short vowel. Although the vowel sounds in Modern English are very different than in Old English, readers can often get an idea of how vowels used to sound like based on an English word's spelling, which often shows words' historical roots rather than their current pronunciation. Long vowels in Old English could be written with a bar on top of the vowel like in gōd (good). Later, during the days of Middle English, spellings used to spell long vowels included spelling with two vowels together like in book or break and putting a silent "E" at the end of the word like in hate. These vowels were all long vowels until the Great Vowel Shift in English, in which the vowel sounds in English changed to sound very differently from before.

Classical Latin had both vowel and consonant lengthening, and long vowels had a macron, or a straight horizontal line, written above them. In Classical Latin, ānus (/ˈaː.nus/), annus (/ˈan.nus/), and anus (/ˈa.nus/) were all different words. Ānus means "buttocks", annus means year, and anus means old woman. Today, none of the Romance languages, the languages that are daughter languages of Latin, can distinguish words by vowel length, though Italian can distinguish words by consonant length: /anno/ "year", /ano/ "anus". Italian also has vowel lengthening in accented syllables ending in a vowel, but vowel length cannot make the difference between two words as it could in Latin.  

[[Great Vowel Shift]]

CATEGORIES: English language, Linguistics

The Great Vowel Shift is a sound change in the English language when all the long vowel sounds in English changed. This took place from the late Middle English period to the Early Modern English period. This is the main reason why English words often sound different from how they are spelled.

[[Sound change]]

CATEGORIES: Linguistics

A sound change in a language is when the sounds of the language become different overtime. Since people of different languages or dialects often talk to each other, the way people talk becomes more like the way the others talk. Because of this, it is natural for languages to sound differently overtime. Sometimes it happens slowly, while in other times it happens quickly.

An example of a sound change in English is the Great Vowel Shift, when all of the long vowel sounds in Middle English changed into what they are today. This is why the way English is spelled is so differently from how it is spoken. 

Spelling systems that do not change with the sound changes of a language are often more difficult for a learner to learn how to read in that language. These kinds of spellings are called fossilized spellings. These include spelling systems like English, French, Mongolian script, and Thai. All of these spelling systems have changed little for the past few hundred years, even though their spoken languages sound very different from how they used to sound. Spelling systems that change with the sound changes are often easier for a  learner to learn how to read. These languages include Japanese, Turkish, and German.

Another much smaller sound shift in many dialects of English is the cot-caught merger, where words with lower back vowels like in cot and caught sound exactly the same to native speakers of certain English dialects and are spoken without any difference between the two sounds.

[[Mongolian script]]

CATEGORIES: Writing systems, Alphabets

Mongolian script was the first writing system to be used to write the Mongolian language. It is similar to the Arabic alphabet in that it is a cursive writing system, or a writing system where all the letters in a word always touch each other and change depending on if the letter is at the beginning, middle, or end of a word. It is a vertically written system, meaning that it is written top-to-bottom, and it is the only vertical writing system to be read left-to-right (all other vertical systems, like Chinese and Korean, are left-to-right). It is one of the two writing systems used to write the Mongolian language, alongside Cyrillic, in the independent country of Mongolia (which is sometimes called Outer Mongolia to distinguish it from Inner Mongolia) and the only writing system used to write the language in the Chinese autonomous region of Inner Mongolia. Unlike Arabic, and Old Uyghur, the Traditional Mongolian script and it's variants are an abugida and brahmic script. It is also used to write several other Mongolic and Tungustic languages such as Buryat, Kalmyk, Oirat, Manchu, and Xibe.

It is believed that the reason why Mongolian script is vertical is so that it could easily be written on the neck of a horse, which horses were a very important part of Mongolian culture. In the year 1208, Genghis Khan captured a Uighur scribe named Tatar-Tonga and forced him to make the alphabet of his native language, the Old Uyghr alphabet, be used to write the Mongolian language. It did not fit the Mongolian language well, and it was difficult to learn even for native Mongolian speakers.

In 1941, a few decades after Mongolia became a communist state, the Cyrillic alphabet replaced Mongolian script likely due to influence from their communist ally, the Soviet Union. After the fall of communism,  Mongolia made Mongolian script official alongside Cyrillic to revive Mongolian culture. However, Cyrillic is still more common due to the lack of education in Mongolian writing, the lack of money to support it, and the difficulty of typing Mongolian on a computer. Also, more Mongolians can read Cyrillic than Mongolian script.  In Inner Mongolia, on the other hand, most ethnic Mongols do not know Cyrillic and can only read Mongolian in the Mongolian script.

[[Autonomous regions of China]]

CATEGORIES: Autonomous regions of China

Autonomous regions of China are areas with very large numbers of ethnic minorities living in them. Their local government is similar to a province, but unlike provinces, minority languages are often co-official alongside the Chinese language, and some laws are written to meet the needs of the minority groups. China's five autonomous regions are the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the Tibet Autonomous Region, the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region (East Turkestan), and the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. Their shortened names are Guangxi, Inner Mongolia, Tibet, Xinjiang, and Ningxia respectively. The largest minority group in each region are the Zhuang, the Mongol, the Tibetan, the Uighur, and the Hui people respectively.

[[Manchu language]]

CATEGORIES: Languages of China

The Manchu language is a Tungustic language and it was the native language of the Manchu people before and during the Qing dynasty. The Manchus are the ethnic minority in China that overthrew the Ming dynasty in 1644 and took over the country. When they ruled, they formed the Qing dynasty. Manchu uses a version of the Mongolian script that was changed to better suit the language. For the first 200 years, it was the official language in the courts, although commoners still spoke Chinese. However, during the mid-1800s, it became more common for the Manchu nobles to speak Chinese as their first language. As a matter of fact, China's last emperor, Aisin Gioro Puyi, knew very little Manchu and spoke Chinese as his first language. Nonetheless, Manchu was still written alongside Chinese in official documents until the end of Imperial China. Even though China today has 10 million Manchus, only 20 people speak Manchu today. This makes Manchu a critically endangered language. Almost all Manchus today speak Mandarin Chinese as their first language.

[[Early Modern English]]

CATEGORIES: English language

Early Modern English is the period of the English language when both the written and the spoken English language begins to be familiar to English speakers today, or speakers of Late Modern English. That is the period in which William Shakespeare wrote his plays. What sets Early Modern English apart from Middle English is the Great Vowel Shift, when all long vowel sounds changed to their current sounds.

[[Arch Rivals]]

CATEGORIES: Sports video games, 1989 video games, Game Gear games, Sega Genesis games, Nintendo Entertainment System games

Arch Rivals is an American basketball arcade game from Midway Games. The game was released by Midway in 1989. It was billed by Midway as "A Basket Brawl". It has two-on-two full court basketball games in which players are allowed to punch other players and steal the ball from them.

Arch Rivals allows players to select from a variety of fictional teams. But arcade operators can change the team names to reflect real ones. Home versions of the game were put out for the Sega Genesis, Sega Game Gear and Nintendo Entertainment System.

The game was considered a precursor to the popular arcade basketball game NBA Jam.

Basketball games generally follow standard rules: a full basketball game has four quarters with four minutes each. Both teams have two players each. A player can call for his teammate to pass him the ball or shoot it.

The difference between Arch Rivals and other basketball game titles is the ability to punch an opponent without any penalty and steal the ball away. The referee will only call shot clock violations.

Also in Arch Rivals are hazards, such as candy wrappers and soda cans thrown onto the floor. If a ball handler steps on these, he falls on the floor. He then allows his opponent to steal the ball from him.

[[OpenVPN]]

CATEGORIES: Software

OpenVPN is a VPN protocol that utilizes an open-source code. This means the source code is openly available for anyone to access and develop.

An active community has formed around the OpenVPN project, which has kept it up-to-date and provided regular security audits to ensure it’s viability.

It is particularly known for its security and privacy as well as its adjustability.

OpenVPN typically works on any port and has five encryption algorithms to such as SSL, IPSec or SSH

For the best security and privacy, you should use AES 256-bit encryption, which is essentially unbreakable and should also use a TCP 443 port.

The TCP 443 port will make your connection similar to an https connection. It is essentially a secure connection which can help prevent website blocking and can help you bypass censorship.

For greater speed, it is recommended to use UDP ports, and you can select the default, Blowfish-128 cipher.  This isn’t the absolute highest level of security, but for most people, it will suffice and will operate significantly faster than AES 256 on TCP.

[[Islam in Europe]]

Islam is the second-largest and fastest-growing religion in Europe. Most Muslim communities in Europe formed recently, but certain areas on the Balkans have a long Muslim history. 

Islam entered southern Europe through the invading "Moors" of North Africa in the 8th–10th centuries. Many kingdoms and duchies in Spain, Portugal, Southern Italy and Malta have existed for centuries. After a series of conflicts and wars known as the Reconquista, these areas became Christian.   Islam expanded into the Caucasus through the Muslim conquest of Persia in the 7th century. The Ottoman Empire expanded into southeastern Europe; it conquered large parts of the Byzantine Empire in the 14th and 15th centuries. Later, the power of the Ottoman empire faded, and it lost most of its territories in Europe. It collapsed in 1922.   The countries of the Balkans still have large populations of native Muslims. Many of these Muslims have become secular. 

The term "Muslim Europe" is used for the Muslim-majority countries of Albania, Kosovo and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Transcontinental countries, such as Turkey, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan have large Muslim populations, as does Russia in the North Caucasus.

In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, large numbers of Muslims immigrated to Western Europe. By 2010, an estimated 44 million Muslims were living in Europe (6%), including an estimated 19 million in the EU (3.8%). They are projected to be 8% by 2030.October 2017 They are often the subject of intense discussion and political controversy created by events such as terrorist attacks, the cartoons affair in Denmark, debates over Islamic dress, and ongoing support for populist right-wing parties that view Muslims as a threat to European culture. Such events have also fueled growing debate regarding the topic of Islamophobia, attitudes toward Muslims and the populist right.

The country where most Muslims live in western Europe today is France, where they account for 12.5% of the population. In the European Union, Bulgaria probably has the largest Muslim population, about 15 % of Bulgarians said they were Muslims.

Anthracyclines  are a class of antibiotic drugs. They are obtained from Streptomyces  bacteria. They are used as a form of chemotherapy, to treat a number of cancers, inclusing blood cancer.  The most important clinically are doxorubicin and daunorubicin. They act to inhibit cellular processes around DNA metabolism which results in the death of rapidly dividing cells. Most anthracyclines are administered directly into the blood. Common side effects include decreased immune cell production, nausea, vomiting and hair loss. The greatest potential side effect is dose related damage to heart tissue and modern treatment regimens are designed to minimise this risk. Research continues around new anthracycline variants and formulation with several clinical trials currently underway around the world.

The Pacers–Pistons brawl was a violent fight. It took place at a National Basketball Association (NBA) game between the Indiana Pacers and Detroit Pistons on November 19, 2004.

With 45.9 seconds left in the game, Pistons center Ben Wallace went up for a layup. He was fouled by Pacers small forward Ron Artest. Wallace was mad for being fouled when the game had been already decided. He pushed Artest. A fight took place on the court between several players. When the fight was broken up, a fan threw a drink at Artest while he was lying on the scorer's table. Artest then went after the fan. That caused a massive fight between players and spectators. The fight went from the seats to the court. It lasted several minutes.

After the game, the NBA didn't allow nine NBA players a total of 146 games. That led to $11 million in salaries being lost by the players.

Ron Artest, Jermaine O'Neal, Ben Wallace and Stephen Jackson were taken from NBA basketball playing for a time on November 20, 2004.

Artest was taken from NBA basketball playing for the rest of the 2004–05 season. He lost almost $5 million in salary. Jermaine O'Neal also lost more than $4 million for his part in the fights. The players who were removed lost a total of $11 million in salary.

[[Passive-aggressive behaviour]]

CATEGORIES: Psychology, Psychiatry, Language

Passive-aggressive behaviour is indirect aggression that pretends to be innocent. This means someone pretends to be nice, but is actually being mean. It can happen when people do what others want to stop direct confrontation, but they do not agree with what is ordered or suggested. A passive-aggressive person tries to hide their anger. For example, "I would have had a good day if I hadn't been cleaning up someone's mess". This sounds okay when someone first reads it, but it is actually them being mad at the person who made the mess.

This is not a psychological problem. It is just a way of behaving. In the workplace it occurs when people do not want to do what the employer wants them to do. The behaviour was first defined during World War II. Men were not openly defiant. They used "passive measures, such as pouting, stubbornness, procrastination, inefficiency, and passive obstructionism" to show their feelings.

[[Memoization]]

CATEGORIES: Computer science

Memoization (or memoisation) is a technique from computer programming to optimize a computer program. Computer programs call functions. Each function calculates a result it will return. Memoization  is simple: before the value is returned from the function call, it is stored in a table (or associative array). Like a cache, this array will only be able to store a limited number of results. The function can then be changed so it tries to look up the value of the input in its lookup table. This lookup is much less expensive than doing the calculation again. Also like a cache: the data table will be cleaned periodically, for examples the values that have not been lookued up for a given time are removed.

Although related to caching, memoization refers to a specific case of this optimization, distinguishing it from forms of caching such as buffering or page replacement. In the context of some logic programming languages, memoization is also known as tabling; see also lookup table.

In January 2019, she announced the formation of an exploratory committee to think about running for the Democratic nomination in the 2020 United States presidential election. She made the announcement on January 15, 2019, in an appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.

In a Twitter video post on March 17, 2019, Gillibrand announced that she was officially running for president.

They are small and compact, making them easy to handle even for children. Dutch have short, glossy fur. They come in these colors: black, blue, chocolate, gray, steel, and tortoise. They grow to be 3 1/2 to 5 1/2 pounds. The Dutch rabbit breed originated in the Netherlands. Very early in their development the rabbits with Dutch markings were called Petite Brabicons. When they came to England they were called Hollanders. Later they came to be known as Dutch. Dutch are generally friendly, gentle, and hardy. Because of their small size and social temperament, they are an excellent choice for children.

Dutch are commonly used for showing, and make challenging show rabbits because of their unique markings.

CATEGORIES: Polymers, Waste

Plastic waste describes plastic objects which have not been recycled properly.  Between one and eight million tons of plastic waste enters the Earth's oceans every year, and the World Economic Forum predicts this will double by 2030 if no action is taken.  Thin plastic objects such as plastic bags can be accidentally blown away by the wind.  This can cause drainage problems on land and pollution at sea.

[[Know-Nothing Party]]

CATEGORIES: Political parties in the United States

The American Party, commonly known as the Know-Nothing Party, was an American nativist political party that operated in the mid-1850s. It was originally anti-Catholic, prejudiced against other nationalities, and against immigration. The movement was briefly a major political party in the form of the American Party. Followers of the movement were to reply "I know nothing" when asked about its specifics by outsiders, thus providing the group with its most common name.

The Know-Nothings believed a "Romanist" conspiracy was in progress, trying to undermine the power and authority of civil and religious liberty in the United States and wanted to politically organize native-born Protestants in a defense of their traditional religious and political values. It is remembered for this theme because of fears by Protestants that Catholic priests and bishops would control a large amount of voters. In most places, Know-Nothingism lasted only a year or two before disintegrating because of weak local leaders, few publicly declared national leaders and a deep split over the issue of slavery. In the South, the party did not focus on anti-Catholicism, but was the main alternative to the dominant Democratic Party.

The collapse of the Whig Party after the Kansas–Nebraska Act passed left an opening for a new major party in to oppose the Democrats. The Know-Nothings elected congressman Nathaniel P. Banks of Massachusetts and many others in the 1854 elections and created a new party known as the American Party. Particularly in the South, the American Party served as a party for politicians who disagreed with the Democratic Party. Many also hoped that it would seek a middle ground between the pro-slavery positions of many Democratic politicians and the anti-slavery positions of the emerging Republican Party. The American Party nominated former President Millard Fillmore in the 1856 presidential election, although he kept quiet about his membership. Fillmore received 21.5% of the popular vote in the 1856 presidential election, finishing behind the Democratic and Republican nominees.

The party quickly declined after the 1856 election. The 1857 Dred Scott v. Sandford decision further aroused opposition to slavery in the North, where many Know Nothings joined the Republicans. Most of the remaining members of the party supported the Constitutional Union Party in the 1860 presidential election.

On January 23, 2019, Pete Buttigieg, then-mayor of South Bend, Indiana, announced the formation of an exploratory committee to run for President of the United States in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries. He formally announced his candidacy on April 14, 2019 in South Bend.

He had been speculated as a potential candidate, visiting the early caucus state of Iowa in December 2018, where he announced he would not run for reelection in 2019. He would be the first openly gay elected official to run for president.

Early on, Buttigeg would solidify himself as a candidate ready to "turn the page". He made every debate and proved he could hang with the bigger names such as Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden & Elizabeth Warren. He gained points in the polls, and during the Iowa Caucuses, he declared himself victorious before results came in during his speech. He seemed to have been right, as Buttigeg earned 14 delegates in Iowa. He earned 9 in New Hampshire the following week. However, Buttigeg only earned 3 in Nevada despite his efforts with the Latino/Mexican community. He earned none in South Carolina, where the black population is high.

Buttigieg ended his campaign after losing the South Carolina primary on March 1, 2020. He endorsed Joe Biden.

CATEGORIES: Government

A polity is a group of people who are brought together by any form of political agreement and who consider themselves as forming an autonomous unit. The political agreement uniting the group may be of different types: it can be a written constitution or even the unwritten recognition and respect of a hierarchy within the group. Depending on the size of the polity, it can be organized by a government or other, simpler forms of hierarchy. It is important to realize that the term polity can be used to refer to big entities like states, empires, and kingdoms, but also to smaller units like chiefdoms. What counts in calling a given group "a polity" is not its size nor the form of government it has. To be called "a polity" a group must be an organized and autonomous group that has exclusive rights of use of a specific portion of land.

[[Test match (cricket)]]

CATEGORIES: Cricket

Test matches in cricket are the orignal and main form of international competition. They last five days, and are thought to be the highest standard of play.

Test matches were invented in the 19th century as a competition between England and Australia. The first officially recognised Test match took place on 15–19 March 1877 and was played between England and Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG).   Australia won by 45 runs. A Test match to celebrate 100 years of Test cricket was held in Melbourne on 12–17 March 1977, in which Australia beat England by 45 runs—the same margin as that first Test. That first tour match was followed by a second test match, which was won by England. There were also a few games played against local teams, a tradition which continues today.

South Africa became the third team to play Test cricket in 1888–89, and there was a long period before other countries played test cricket. The West Indies ('Windies') were the fourth test country: they played against England in London 1928 at Lords cricket ground.  New Zealand first played against England in 1930 in Christchurch. The first Indian test side played England in 1932 in London at Lords.

When British India was partitioned, the new nation Pakistan was given test status in 1952, on the recommendation of India. Their first test match was against India in Delhi. They were followed by Sri Lanka in 1982.

There are also four more countries who have full test status: Zimbabwe (1992), Bangladesh (2000), Ireland  the Irish team represents both parts of Ireland – (2018), and Afghanistan (2018). Of these only Bangladesh has played regularly against the longer-established nations.  There is a real gulf in playing standards between the top teams and the newcomers. This explains why there have been no test series between the stronger test countries and the weaker countries. A test series must be competitive for it to be commercially viable. Television rights need to be sold, and spectators attracted to the matches. Also, a country must be able to keep some cricket grounds to test standards.

It is clear that the sport of cricket spread mostly to countries of the former British Empire, with the notable exception of Canada (where cricket is just a minor sport). On the other hand, it is a truly international sport, played by nations in Europe, Africa (parts of), the Caribbean, the Indian subcontinent and Oceania.

[[Wadati–Benioff zone]]

CATEGORIES: Plate tectonics, Earthquakes

A Wadati–Benioff zone is an area within the Earth's crust where earthquakes frequently occur. The frequency of earthquakes in these areas is due to the convergence and subduction of tectonic plates.

According to the theory of plate tectonics lithospheric plates move towards each other along convergent plate boundaries. When two plates collide, one is often submerged below the other. They are referred as downgoing and overriding plates respectively.

When a downgoing plate (usually composed of oceanic lithosphere) submerges beneath an overriding plate shallow earthquakes occur at the plate boundary and deeper earthquakes occur in the downgoing plate as it sinks into the Earth. The deep earthquakes caused by the downgoing plate form the Wadati–Benioff zone. The deepest recorded earthquakes come from Wadati–Benioff zones and can extend to depths as much as 650 km (400 mi) deep.

[[Selective Service System]]

CATEGORIES: Law

The Selective Service System is an independent agency of the United States government. It has information on those subject to the U.S. military draft. All male U.S. citizens and male immigrant non-citizens between ages 18 and 25 are required by law to register within 30 days of their 18th birthdays. They must also contact the Selective Service within ten days of any changes of any information they gave, like a change of address. Females, on the other hand, are not required to register.

Registration with Selective Service is also required for several federal programs and benefits, including job training, federal employment, naturalization, Pell grants and student loans.

On July 2, 1980, then-President Jimmy Carter signed Proclamation 4771 (Registration under the Military Selective Service Act). That was in response to the Soviet war in Afghanistan the previous year. It re-established the Selective Service registration requirement for all 18-to-26 year old men born on or after January 1, 1960.

The first registrations began on July 21, 1980 at various post offices across the United States, starting with men born in 1960. Men born in or after 1963 were required to register within 30 days of their 18th birthday.

On April 27, 2016, the Armed House Services Committee voted to add an amendment to extend the authority for draft registration to females. If the bill had passed, it would have authorized then-President Barack Obama to order young women as well as men to register with the Selective System.

[[Superpermutation]]

CATEGORIES: Pages with unreviewed translations, Mathematics

In combinatorial math, a superpermutation is a list of numbers that contains each different arrangement of symbols it is made up of inside of it. While superpermutations can simply be made up of every arrangement listed side by side, it can also be shorter. Sometimes, the arrangements may overlap. For example, when there are 2 different symbols, the superpermutation 1221 contains all possible arrangements, 12 and 21. The list 121 also contains both permutations, 12 at the beginning and 21 at the end.

As the number of symbols increases, the length of the superpermutation increases, too. The superpermutation with only 1 symbol is only 1 long (1), while the 2nd superpermutation is 3 long (121). The 3rd superpermutation is 9 long (123121321), and the 4th one is 33 long (123412314231243121342132413214321). The length of the superpermutation with 5 symbols is 153, and it looks like this:

123451234152341253412354123145231425314235142315423124531243512431

So far, mathematicians have not been able to find the smallest length superpermutation that uses 6 or more symbols. They are slowly getting closer to finding it out.

[[War of the Austrian Succession]]

CATEGORIES: War, History of Austria

The War of the Austrian Succession (1740–1748) involved most countries in Europe. It was fought over Archduchess Maria Theresa's succession to the Habsburg Monarchy. The war included other events such as King George's War in British America, the War of Jenkins' Ear (which formally began on 23 October 1739), the First Carnatic War in India, the Jacobite rising of 1745 in Scotland, and the First and Second Silesian Wars.

Maria Theresa was not allowed to succeed to the various crowns of her father, Charles VI, because Salic law would not let a woman inherit them. That gave an opportunity for France and Prussia, joined by Bavaria, to challenge Habsburg power. Maria Theresa was supported by Great Britain, the Dutch Republic, Sardinia, and Saxony.

Spain had been at war with Britain over colonies and trade since 1739 to re-establish its influence in northern Italy. Austria had taken control of northern Italy because of the War of the Spanish Succession in the early 18th century.

The war ended with the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748. Maria Theresa was confirmed as Archduchess of Austria and Queen of Hungary, but Prussia kept control of Silesia. The peace did not last, however, because of Austria's desire to recapture Silesia and the political upheaval in Europe, and soon came the Seven Years' War (1756–1763).

CATEGORIES: Cattle breeds

The Highland cattle (Bò Ghàidhealach; Heilan coo) is a Scottish cattle breed. They have long horns and long, wavy, woolly coats. The long oily outer hair covers a downy undercoat. This makes them well suited to conditions in the Highlands, which have a high annual rainfall and sometimes very strong winds.

Highlands are raised primarily for their meat. They originated in the Scottish Highlands and the Outer Hebrides. They were first mentioned in the 6th century AD.  They have since been exported worldwide.

They are a hardy breed. Their long hair gives them the ability to overwinter in the valleys. Bulls can weigh up to 800 kilograms (1,800 pounds) and cows can up to 500 kilograms (1,100 pounds). Their milk generally has a high butterfat content.  Their meat, which is of the highest quality, is lower in cholesterol than other varieties of beef.

[[Phlogiston theory]]

CATEGORIES: History of science, Chemical reactions, Thermodynamics

The phlogiston theory once put forward the belief that there was a fire-like element called phlogiston inside combustible bodies which was released during combustion. When the substances burned, the phlogiston escaped leaving a solid ash called calx. This theory explained why the mass after burning fuels was less than the original mass.

The theory was first suggested in 1667 by Johann Joachim Becher, but was dismissed at the end of the 18th century following further experiments by Antoine Lavoisier and others.

Careful experiments that measured the masses of gasses showed that the phlogiston theory was wrong. This led to the discovery of oxygen. However, some scientists continued to believe in phlogiston. They thought this explained the heat and light given off in combustion reactions. Today we see this as evidence of the transfer of energy to the surroundings.

[[Romanization of Greek]]

CATEGORIES: Romanization, Greek language

Romanization of Greek is a way to write the Greek language (either Ancient or Modern Greek) with the Roman alphabet. That can be done by mapping either letters (called transliteration) or sounds (called transcription. The Greek name Ἰωάννης can be transliterated as Johannes, which became John in Modern English. In Modern Greek, it is generally written Γιάννης, which transliterates to Yannis. The masculine Greek word Ἅγιος or Άγιος might variously appear as Hagiοs, Agios, Aghios or Ayios, or it might simply be translated as "Holy" or "Saint" in English forms of Greek placenames.

Traditional English renderings of Greek names originated from Roman systems that were established in antiquity. The Roman alphabet was a form of the Cumaean alphabet, which was itself developed from the Euboean script, which used Χ as /ks/, Η as /h/, and variant forms of Λ and Σ that later became L and S. When the Euboean script was used to write the classical Greek alphabet, ⟨κ⟩ was replaced with ⟨c⟩, ⟨αι⟩ and ⟨οι⟩ became ⟨æ⟩ and ⟨œ⟩, and ⟨ει⟩ and ⟨ου⟩ were simplified to ⟨i⟩ (more rarely, corresponding to an earlier pronunciation, to ⟨e⟩) and ⟨u⟩. Aspirated consonants like ⟨θ⟩, ⟨φ⟩, initial-⟨ρ⟩, and ⟨χ⟩ simply wrote out the sound: ⟨th⟩, ⟨ph⟩, ⟨rh⟩, and ⟨ch⟩. Because English orthography has changed so much from the original Greek, modern scholarly transliteration now usually renders ⟨κ⟩ as ⟨k⟩ and the diphthongs ⟨αι, οι, ει, ου⟩ as ⟨ai, oi, ei, ou⟩. Modern scholars also increasingly render ⟨χ⟩ as ⟨kh⟩.August 2015 Gteek sounds greatly changed, and Modern Greek sounds quite different from Ancient Greek. That also has had an influence on the terms used in English and other languages and had led to a number of different romanizations for names and placenames in the 19th and the 20th centuries. The Hellenic Organization for Standardization (ELOT) issued its system in co-operation with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1983. The system was adopted (with minor modifications) by the United Nations' Fifth Conference on the Standardization of Geographical Names at Montreal in 1987, by the United Kingdom's Permanent Committee on Geographical Names for British Official Use (PCGN) and by the United States' Board on Geographic Names (BGN) in 1996, and by the ISO itself in 1997. Romanization of names for official purposes, as with passports and identity cards, were required to use the ELOT system within Greece until 2011, when a legal decision permitted Greeks to use irregular forms (such as "Demetrios" for Δημήτριος) provided that official identification and documents also list the standard forms (as, for example, "Demetrios OR Dimitrios"). Other romanization systems are the BGN/PCGN's earlier 1962 system and the system employed by the American Library Association and the United States' Library of Congress.

Deltarune is a role-playing video game created by American indie developer Toby Fox. The player controls a human, Kris, in a world where monsters live on the surface of the Earth. Kris and a classmate named Susie fall from Earth into a place called the “Dark World” where they meet Ralsei, who tells them that they are heroes destined to restore balance to the world. The players meet various beings who call themselves "Darkners" during a quest to seal the dark fountain. Mainly through the combat system, the player encounters multiple enemies who attack with a bullet hell system, which can be resolved peacefully or by fighting them. The first chapter of the game was released on October 31, 2018 for Microsoft Windows and macOS for free, with a later Nintendo Switch release on February 28, 2019, with a PlayStation 4 port also in the works. The game's graphics are similar to 16-bit Japanese role-playing games such as EarthBound, Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga and Chrono Trigger.

As of December 2018, Chapter 2 is planned, but no release date has been announced yet.

CATEGORIES: NASA spacecraft, Planetary rovers

Opportunity, also known as MER-B (Mars Exploration Rover – B) or MER-1, and nicknamed Oppy, was a robotic rover that was active on Mars from 2004 to 2018.

It was launched on July 7, 2003, as part of NASA's Mars Exploration Rover program, it landed in Meridiani Planum on January 25, 2004, three weeks after its twin Spirit (MER-A) touched down on the other side of the planet Mars.

With a planned 90-sol duration of activity (slightly more than 90 earth days), Spirit functioned until getting stuck in 2009 and stopped communications in 2010.  Opportunity was able to stay operational for 5352 sols after landing, maintaining its power and key systems through continual recharging of its batteries through solar power.

Opportunity was active for 2004 (in Earth Time), 55 times more than its lifespan. By June 10, 2018, when it last contacted NASA, the rover had traveled a distance of 45.16.

Due to the massive dust storms on Mars in 2018, Opportunity stopped communications on June 10, 2018. It was hoped it would reboot once the atmosphere cleared. However it did not, as it either suffered a catastrophic failure or that a layer of dust has covered its solar panels.

On February 13, 2019, NASA officials declared that the Opportunity mission was complete, after the spacecraft failed to respond to repeated signals sent since August 2018.

[[Prime factorization]]

CATEGORIES: Number theory, Prime numbers

Prime factorization of any given number is to breakdown the number into its factors until all of its factors are prime numbers. This can be achieved by dividing the given number from smallest prime number and continue it until all its factors are prime.

Example: Prime factorization of number 1729

You should see if the number is divisible by smallest prime numbers, since 1729 isn't divisible by 2, move to next smallest prime number, that is 3, but the remainder is still non zero, next prime numbers are 5,7 and so on, dividing by 7 gives a zero remainder. 

1729 = 7*247, further check if 247 is a prime or not , if its not prime, continue the same steps of prime factorization for 247.

1729 = 7*247 = 7*13*19, Notice that all the factors for the 1729 at this point are prime and no further factors are possible except 1, so further factorization should be stopped.

La Belle Époque (bɛlepɔk; French for "The Beautiful Era") was a period of Western history. It lasted from the end of the Franco-Prussian War in 1871 to the outbreak of World War I in 1914. 

It was a period of optimism, peace, economic prosperity. The colonial empires were well established. There were many technological, scientific, and cultural innovations. The arts flourished in  Paris and elsewhere. Many masterpieces of literature, music, theatre, and visual art were created. 

The Belle Époque was named after the event. It was considered a "Golden Age" in contrast to the horrors of World War I. The Belle Epoque was a period in which, according to historian R.R. Palmer, "European civilization achieved its greatest power in global politics, and also exerted its maximum influence upon peoples outside Europe".

In the United Kingdom, the Belle Époque overlapped with the late Victorian era and the Edwardian era in a period known as Pax Britannica. In Germany, the Belle Époque coincided with the reigns of William I, Frederick III and Wilhelm II. In Italy, with the reigns of Victor Emmanuel II, Umberto I and early of the reign of Victor Emmanuel III. In Russia, with the reigns of Alexander III and Nicholas II. 

In the United States,  after the Panic of 1873, the same period was called the Gilded Age (1870s1900s). In Brazil, it started with the end of the Paraguayan War. In Mexico, the period was known as the Porfiriato, and in Japan, it coincided with the Meiji period.

[[Electronic signature]]

CATEGORIES: Law, Computing, Internet

An electronic signature is an electronic record of an agreement.

Contracts have been used for a long time to show that two parties agree on something. Often these parties will then write a document that they both sign to show this agreement. In the times of the internet, many of these documents are transmitted in digital form, but showing agreement is still needed. That is where an electronic signature comes in. 

The concept of electornic sgnature itself is not new. Common law jurisdictions have recognized telegraph signatures as far back as the mid-19th century, and faxed signatures since the 1980s. 

Electronic signatures exist in different forms. All forms can show that somebody agreed with something.  Some forms can also protect the data the person agreed with from being changed easily, or they can legally identify the person that agreed. To do this, ideas from public-key cryptography are used: digital signatures, certificates, and hash codes. An electronic signature often includes a timestamp to show when the signature was made. Much like cryptography, electronic signatures can be used for any kind of data, there is no requirement that the data signed has a specific format. 

Even though cryptography is often used, the term electronic signature has a legal meaning. This is different from the technical term digital signature used in cryptography. Many countries have made regulations so that  some electronic signatures   are equivalent to a handwritten signature for many purposes. 

There are different ways in which an electronic signature can be done. Many countries have  standards as to what such a signature must look like. Examples for such regulations are eIDAS in the European Union, NIST-DSS in the United States or ZertES in Switzerland.

[[Phase-locked loop]]

CATEGORIES: Science, Electronics, Technology

In electronics, a phase-locked loop is a type of circuit that guarantees that the output keeps a known phase relationship with the input. If the output begins to lose this relationship, then the electronics will correct it until the output is returned to the correct phase again. When the phase of an output is steady, then the phase is locked. Each time the phase is measured, the electronics will correct any deviation of the output. Hence, a loop is created which continually corrects the signal.

[[Premarital sex]]

CATEGORIES: Human sexuality

Premarital sex is sexual activity performed by people before they're married. In the past, premarital sex was called a moral issue. It was taboo in many cultures. It was also called a sin by many religions. Since about the 1960s, however, it has become more accepted, especially in the Western world.

Until the 1950s, "premarital sex" meant having sexual relations between two people before they married each other.

Beginning in the 1920s, and especially after World War II, premarital sex became more common, especially with women. By the end of the 20th century, 75 to 80 percent of Americans had performed vaginal intercourse before age 19.

A 2011 study looked at young adults. It found that men said they had fewer negative and more positive emotional reactions. Women said condom use had fewer positive and more negative reactions. But cohort studies over 23 years found that in later years, women had greater pleasure and less guilt.
