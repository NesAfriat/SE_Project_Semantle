[[Sniper Elite series]]

CATEGORIES: Video games, Types of video games

The Sniper Elite series is a series of stealth-based World War II third-person shooter video games with special attention placed on long-distance bullet physics. In these games, players need to pay attention to how far their enemies are, the effective range of their sniper rifles, and how hard the wind is blowing, since all of these will affect where the player's bullets will hit. Most of the levels are about the player going to the vantage point (the best place for a sniper to kill his or her target), killing or destroying his or her target, and evacuating the area.

Players will need to use stealth throughout the levels, since the player can die with just a few hits. If players fire their rifles when there are loud noises in the background, the player can kill enemy soliders without other soldiers noticing. However, the player must be careful to hide dead bodies or shoot when no one is watching, since dead bodies will alert other enemy soldiers and make them harder to hit. If the player holds his or her lungs, the in-game time will slow down and there will be a marker that shows where the bullet will hit. The games have an X-ray feature that shows where the bullets hit the enemy and how the bullets injure enemies. Points are awarded based on how far the player is, where the player hits the enemy, and whether other enemy soldiers notice the player killing them.

Along with a sniper rifle, the player can also carry a pistol, a submachine gun, and explosives. Some pistols have a suppressor so that the player can kill enemies without being heard, others do not, so the player must be careful when choosing his or her weapons. Submachine guns are best used in emergency close-quarters firefights, but the player must be careful not to waste ammo. Explosives can be used to lay traps for the enemy or protect the player from being flanked.

In some of the games, there are DLC levels where the player is sent to assassinate Adolf Hitler.

CATEGORIES: 2019 Pacific typhoon season

Typhoon Lekima, known in the Philippines as the Typhoon Hanna, was the second-costliest typhoon in Chinese history, only behind Fitow in 2013. The ninth named storm of the 2019 Pacific typhoon season, Lekima originated from a tropical depression that formed east of the Philippines on July 30. It gradually organized, became a tropical storm and was named on August 4. Lekima intensified under favourable environmental conditions and peaked as a Category 4–equivalent super typhoon. However, an eyewall replacement cycle caused the typhoon to weaken before it made landfall in Zhejiang late on August 9, as a Category 2–equivalent typhoon. Lekima weakened subsequently while moving across the East China, and made its second landfall in Shandong on August 11.

Lekima's precursor enhanced the southwestern monsoon in the Philippines, which brought heavy rain to the country. The rains caused three boats to sink and 31 people died in this accident. Lekima brought catastrophic damage in mainland China, with a death toll of 89 people and more than CN¥53.7 billion (US$7.6 billion) in damages. The system also caused minor damage in Ryukyu Islands and Taiwan.

[[Lever-action firearms]]

CATEGORIES: Firearms, Rifles

Lever-action firearms are guns that hold multiple bullets and are loaded by pulling and pushing a lever at the bottom of the gun.

Lever-action rifles first became important weapons during the American Civil War. Two rifles made during this time were the Henry and Spencer rifles. They fired much more quickly and could be loaded much faster than muzzleloading rifles. However, their use was limited because many generals felt that the ability to shoot many bullets without reloading would cause soldiers to shoot with less accuracy. However, after the Civil War, lever-action guns became much more popular. They were popular with not just soldiers, but also with hunters and even civilians. They were so popular that the most famous lever-action rifle, the Winchester Model 1873, was called "the gun that won the West".

Both the militaries of the United States and the Russian Empire used lever-action guns often until the beginning of the 20th century. Even though lever action guns can fire much faster than bolt-action rifles (lever-actions can fire 2 rounds a second in skilled hands,) the bolt-action rifle was chosen to be the main gun for most infantry. This was because bolt-action rifles could easily be fired when soldiers are lying on the ground, but lever-actions cannot do so easily.

Lever-action guns were made for many different types of bullets, both pistol and rifle bullets. Most lever-action guns are rifles, but there are also lever-action shotguns as well. The most famous of these are the Winchester Model 1887.

[[Winchester Model 1887]]

CATEGORIES: Shotguns

The Winchester Model 1887 is a lever-action shotgun invented by John Browning. It was one of the first successful repeating shotguns. When the repeating rifle became more popular in the decades after the American Civil War, the need for a shotgun that could hold more than just two shotgun shells at a time also grew. Using the same lever action used in repeating rifles, John Browning created the Model 1887. While it was popular at the time it was first made, its popularity quickly went away after John Browning invented the first pump-action shotgun a few years later.

Even though it quickly lost its popularity in the real world, it is still a popular gun shown in movies and video games. It was the gun of choice for characters Kyle Reese and the T-800 in the Terminator movies. It was also one of the most popular guns used in the video game Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2.

[[Gatling gun]]

CATEGORIES: Machine guns

The Gatling gun is a machine gun that has many barrels that fire bullets by turning the barrels around in a circle. It was the first machine gun ever made. It was first used by the Union Army during the American Civil War. Although it was very powerful, it was not much used because it cost a lot of money and was heavy.  It was used more often in other wars during the second half of the 19th century. It was used in the Anglo-Zulu War, the Boshin War, and the Spanish-American War. Early in the 20th century armies stopped using it because other machine guns were better.   

The Minigun is based on the Gatling gun. The Gatling gun is a machine gun, but it is not called an automatic weapon because a user must continue to crank it instead of merely holding down the trigger. Still it was very useful in the wars.

[[Consumer Reports]]

CATEGORIES: Non-profit organizations of the United States, 1936 establishments in the United States

Consumer Reports (CR) is a nonprofit organization focused only on unbiased product testing, investigative journalism, consumer-focused research, public education, and consumer advocacy. 

Founded in 1936 as Consumer Union, CR was created to serve as a information source that consumers could use to help assess product performance and safety. Since that time, CR has continued its testing and analysis of products and services, and advocate for the consumer in legislative and rule-making areas. Consumer Reports helped advocate for seat belt laws, the dangers of cigarettes, and recently,  the growth of consumer finance protection and the growth of consumer access to better health care. The organization has also expanded its scope to a set of digital platforms.

The organization’s headquarters, including its 50 testing labs, is in Yonkers, New York, while its cars are tested at a track site in East Haddam, Connecticut. CR is funded by subscriptions to its magazine and website, as well as through independent grants and donations. Marta L. Tellado is the current CEO of Consumer Reports. She joined the organization in 2014, with the goal of expanding its engagement and advocacy efforts.

Consumer Reports' website and magazine writes reviews and comparisons of consumer products and services based on reporting and results from its in-house testing laboratory and survey research center. CR accepts no advertising, and has no shareholders as a nonprofit organization. It also publishes general and targeted product/service buying guides. Consumer Reports pays for all the products it tests through common ways citizens buy products and services. They do this through secret, anonymous shoppers. 

Only paid subscribers can access its website ConsumerReports.org, in its entirety. ConsumerReports.org writes updates on product availability, and adds new products to already existing test results. In addition, the online data includes features that is not in the magazine; for example, vehicle reliability (frequency of repair) tables online show the full 10 model years reported in the Annual Questionnaires, but the magazine has only a six-year history of each model.

Consumer Reports also allows the creators of the product to improve its product before Consumer Reports publishes its final results.

[[Break-open shotgun]]

CATEGORIES: Shotguns

A break-open shotgun is a type of shotgun that loads shotgun shells by opening up the barrels, taking out the spent shells, placing a new shell in each chamber, then closing the barrels. Most are either single- or double-barrel. Triple- and quadruple-barrel (four barrel) shotguns also exist, but single- and double-barrel shotguns are easier to make and less likely to jam. 

Most double-barrel shotguns are made with their barrels touching side-by-side. However, there are also shotguns where one barrel is on top of the other. Over-and-under shotguns are easier to aim than side-by-side shotguns because you do not need to aim a little to the left or right.

Since the metal cartridge was invented in 1845, most shotguns were break-open shotguns until the repeating shotgun was invented. However, break-open shotguns are still popular with civilians because they are easier to use and less likely to jam than repeating shotguns. Nonetheless, they hold fewer shells than repeating shotguns.

This happens in the central nervous system (usually cerebral AVM), but may appear in any location. The disease can cause intense pain or bleeding or lead to other serious medical problems such as cerebral hemorrhages or strokes.

AVMs are usually congenital. The genetic patterns of AVMs are incomplete, but there are known genetic mutations.

The general symptoms of a cerebral AVM include headaches and epileptic seizures. More specific symptoms occurring that normally depend on the place of the malformation.

[[Cerebral arteriovenous malformation]]

CATEGORIES: Brain, Diseases

The 2019 Brazil wildfires is the result of at least 75,336 wildfires occurred in the country since January 2019.

As of August 20, there are fires burning in the Amazon rainforest in four Brazilian states: Amazonas, Rondônia, Mato Grosso and Pará. At least 39,194 fires have been detected in Amazonas, which is the largest state in Brazil by area, and which has the "largest standing tracts of unbroken rainforest" in the world.

A state of emergency was declared by the government of Amazonas on August 11.

The federal government and President Jair Bolsonaro claims that the data on the numbers are "fake" and refuses to help end the fires or allow other countries to help.

In August, Bolsonaro said no one was allowed to set fires in the Amazon for 60 days.  When someone wants to change rainforest land into a farm or other thing, first they cut down the trees and leave them there.  Then they allow the land to dry.  Then they set it on fire.  So many of the trees were still killed because people could cut them down and wait to burn them until later.

Wildfires were also a problem on the Cerrado grassland, a place with many rare plants and animals.  40% of its animals do not live in any other place on Earth.

Hamilton Howard "Albert" Fish (May 19, 1870 – January 16, 1936) was an American serial killer, child rapist and cannibal.  He was also known as the Gray Man, the Werewolf of Wysteria, the Brooklyn Vampire, the Moon Maniac, and The Boogey Man.  Fish once boasted that he "had children in every state", and at one time stated his number of victims was about 100. However, it is not known whether he was referring to rapes or cannibalization, nor is it known if the statement was truthful.  Fish was a suspect in at least five murders during his lifetime.  Fish confessed to three murders that police were able to trace to a known homicide, and he confessed to stabbing at least two other people. He was put on trial for the kidnapping and murder of Grace Budd, and was convicted and executed by electric chair at Sing Sing.  His last words were, "I don't even know why I'm here."

Fish was known to stab himself with pins, as could be seen from X-rays.  He was also known to eat his own feces.  Fish supposedly ate the penis of at least one of his victims.

Due to modus operandi, his crimes were sometimes confused with those of nearby serial killer Peter Kudzinowski.

[[Mac OS X Public Beta]]

CATEGORIES: MacOS

Mac Os X Public Beta is a Operating System of Apple Computers which are Developed by Apple Inc. Which is later on Updated to the version Mac OS X 10.0

The Mac OS X Public Beta was an early, test version of the Mac OS X operating system released to the public in late 2000 for USD $30. Hardcore Macintosh fans could therefore get a taste of the upcoming operating system before its final release. It was named Kodiak internally by Apple. The name was not publicly used.

The Public Beta was the first time people could use the Aqua interface. Virtually everything was new in the operating system: fonts, the Dock, even the menu bar (with an Apple logo at the centre, which was later repositioned). The icons exploded in size, and new OS eye candy was all the rage.

As it was a public beta, this version was not without its bugs and inconveniences. Apple used user feedback to improve upon the OS, so that a vastly improved Golden Master version of Mac OS X was ready for release by March 2001.

The Public Beta version came with a price tag, and a time limit (set for May 15, 2001). In spite of all these shortcomings, it was still welcomed by the Mac community, with people eager to test drive the new OS.

The Public Beta was superseded by Mac OS X 10.0.0, the first final release of Mac OS X.

[[Lecompton Constitution]]

CATEGORIES: Bleeding Kansas, 1857

The Lecompton Constitution (1857) was one of four proposed constitutions for the state of Kansas. It was written by pro-slavery people. It included parts to allow slavery in the state. It also had parts to not include free blacks from its bill of rights. It was defeated on January 4, 1858 by a majority of voters in the Kansas Territory. The rejection of the Lecompton Constitution, and the admission of Kansas to the Union as a free state, showed the unusual and fraudulent voting practices. These practices had been used in earlier efforts by bushwhackers and border ruffians to create a state constitution in Kansas that allowed slavery.

The Topeka Constitution was written before the Lecompton Constitution. The Leavenworth and Wyandotte Constitutions were written after the Lecompton Constitution. The Wyandotte Consitution became the Kansas state constitution. The document was written in response to the anti-slavery 1855 Topeka Constitution. That constitution was written by James H. Lane and other free-state people. The territorial legislature was filled mostly with slave owners. They met at the chosen capital of Lecompton in September 1857. They met there to write a document that would compete against the other constitutions. Most actual settlers were anti-slavery. They boycotted the vote. Territorial governor of Kansas, Robert J. Walker, was very pro-slavery. However, he was against the obvious unfairness of the Constitution. He quit being governor so he did not have to enforce it.

President James Buchanan was very pro-slavery, so he supported the Lecompton Constitution when it was sent to Congress. The president received the support of the Southern Democrats. However, many Northern Democrats, led by Stephen A. Douglas, voted with the Republicans to be against the constitution.

[[Dalmatian language]]

CATEGORIES: Romance languages

Dalmatian was a Romance language, which was spoken in Dalmatia, on the Eastern Adriatic Sea.  The language became extinct in the Middle Ages.  In places it was used until the 18th or 19th century.  Today, few sources are left.  Only the dialect of Veglia (Krk) and Ragusa (Dubrovnik) have enough sources so they can be studied.  From the other dialects, there are only isloate words, or short phrases. 

In 1897, the scholar Matteo Bartoli, himself a native of nearby Istria, visited postman Tuone Udaina (Antonio Udina), nicknamed burbur ('barber' in Dalmatian) the last known speaker of any Dalmatian dialect, to study his language.  Bartoli wrote down approximately 2,800 words, stories, and accounts of his life, which were published in a book in German (Das Dalmatische) in 1906.  That book has provided much information on the vocabulary, phonology, and grammar of the language. 

One year after the interview, on 10 June 1898, Tuone Udaina was accidentally killed at 74 in a roadwork explosion.

It is a spinoff of the Sonic the Hedgehog series. It takes place in the universe of the Sonic the Hedgehog animated series. Players control Sonic the Hedgehog, who must stop Doctor Robotnik from enslaving the population in a big pinball-like machine.

Sonic Spinball was created by the American staff of Sega Technical Institute. This was because the Japanese staff was busy with making Sonic the Hedgehog 3 and Sonic & Knuckles. When Sega management realized that Sonic 3 would not be finshed in time for the 1993 holiday shopping season, they created another Sonic game. The game was quickly designed. It had short time constraints. Most of the work happened in two months. Sonic Spinball was released for the Sega Genesis in November 1993 and for the Game Gear and Master System in 1994.

Sonic Spinball got good and bad reviews. People liked the idea and graphics. They didn't like the controls. A second pinball game, Sonic Pinball Party, was created in 2003. A Sonic Spinball spinning rollercoaster was built in Alton Towers, a British theme park, in 2010.

[[Sexagesimal]]

CATEGORIES: Numerals

Sexagesimal (base 60) is a number system with sixty as its base. It was invented by the ancient Sumerians in the 3rd millennium BC. It was passed down to the ancient Babylonians, and it is still used—in a modified form—for measuring time, angles, and geographic coordinates.

The number 60 is a composite number. It has twelve factors, namely 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, and 60, of which 2, 3, and 5 are prime numbers. 

Therefore, using sexagesimal numbers, fractions are simplified. For example, one hour can be divided evenly into sections of 30 minutes, 20 minutes, 15 minutes, 12 minutes, 10 minutes, 6 minutes, 5 minutes, 4 minutes, 3 minutes, 2 minutes, and 1 minute. 

60 is the smallest number that is divisible by every number from 1 to 6; that is, it is the lowest common multiple of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

Note: here in this article, all sexagesimal digits are represented as decimal numbers. For example, 10 means the number ten and 60 means the number sixty.

[[Editorial]]

CATEGORIES: Newspapers, Journalism

An editorial, leading article (US) or leader (UK), is an article written by the senior editors of a newspaper or magazine. The article is often unsigned. Australian and major United States newspapers, such as The New York Times and The Boston Globe, often give editorials the heading "opinion".

Editorials can also be in the form of a cartoon.

The editors decide on which issues their readers will want to know the newspaper's opinion.

Editorials are usually published on a special page, called the editorial page. This often features letters to the editor from members of the public. The page opposite this page is called the op-ed page (opposite the editorial); and has opinion pieces by writers not employed by the publication.  However, a newspaper may choose to publish an editorial on the front page. In the English-language press, this occurs rarely and only on topics considered very important; it is more common, however, in some European countries such as Spain, Italy, and France.

Many newspapers do not put the name of the author on the editorial. Tom Clark, editorial writer for The Guardian, argues that it helps readers discuss the issue, not the author. On the other hand, an editorial does reflect the position of a newspaper and the head of the newspaper, the editor, is known by name. Whilst the editor will often not write the editorial themselves, they maintain oversight and retain responsibility.

When The Press, a New Zealand newspaper based in Christchurch, changed after 157 years from broadsheet to compact in 2018, they published a list of editorials where current thinking differs from opinions expressed at the time. One example was the change in their view on women's suffrage in New Zealand. The government gave women the vote in 1893, and the editorial said that women would "much prefer staying at home and attending to their household duties" than going to the polling booths.

In fashion publishing, the term is often used to refer to photo-editorials. These are often full-page photographs on a particular theme, designer, model or other single topic, with or (as in a photo-essay) without accompanying text.

[[Cradle of civilization]]

CATEGORIES: Ancient history

A cradle of civilization is a place where civilization emerged. There was no single "cradle", but several civilizations that developed independently. The Fertile Crescent (Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia), Ancient India, and Ancient China were the first. Whether there was influence between the early civilizations of the Near East and those of East Asia  is not known. 

Scholars accept that the civilizations of Mesoamerica  emerged independently and later than those in Eurasia. They were mainly in modern Mexico, and Norte Chico, in the north-central coastal region of Peru.

Civilization involves the use of writing, building cities, a class-based society, agriculture, animal husbandry, public buildings, metallurgy, and monumental architecture. The term cradle of civilization has been applied to a variety of cultures and areas, in particular the Ancient Near Eastern Chalcolithic and Fertile Crescent, Ancient India and Ancient China. It has also been applied to ancient Anatolia, the Levant and Iranian plateau, and used to refer to culture predecessors—such as Ancient Greece as the predecessor of Western civilization.

[[Eocene–Oligocene extinction event]]

CATEGORIES: Extinction events, Eocene

The end of the Eocene was the beginning of the Oligocene (33.9 million years ago). It is marked by a large-scale floral and faunal turnover. 

Most of the affected organisms were marine or aquatic in nature. They included the last of the ancient cetaceans, the Archaeoceti.

This was a time of major climatic change, especially cooling. At first, it was not  linked with any single major impact or any catastrophic volcanic event. 

But volcanic activity may have caused the extinction event. Several large meteorite impacts occurred about this time. One such event caused the Chesapeake Bay impact crater 40, and another at the Popigai crater 100 in central Siberia, scattering debris perhaps as far as Europe. New dating of the Popigai meteor suggests it may be a cause of the mass extinction.

A leading scientific theory on climate cooling at this time predicts a decrease in atmospheric carbon dioxide, which slowly declined in the mid to late Eocene and possibly reached some threshold about 34 million years ago. This boundary is closely linked with the Oligocene Oi-1 event, an oxygen isotope change which marks the beginning of ice sheet coverage on Antarctica.

Some states, such as Alabama, Iowa, Mississippi, Georgia, Missouri and Florida do not allow sanctuary cities. Others, such as Connecticut, Rhode Island, Illinois New York, Colorado and California allow sanctuary cities.

[[Doom 64]]

CATEGORIES: Shooter video games, 1994 video games, Doom series, DOS games

Doom 64 is a video game that first came out only on the Nintendo 64, but can now be played on today's video game consoles. It is a direct sequel to Doom 2, making it the third part of the Doom story. This is ironic because the story of Doom 3 is not related to Doom or Doom 2, but it is a reboot, which means it is a new start to the Doom story.

Doom 64 has all the same weapons and monsters from Doom 2, but it has a few more new types of monsters and a new weapon, the Unmaker. The weapons and monsters look a little different from the earlier games, but there are fewer differences than in Doom 3. Other than the new graphics and new weapon, the gameplay was not much different from the earlier Doom games. It came out in 1997, but the game did not sell well because many popular FPS games came out that same year, including GoldenEye 007, Quake II, Turok: Dinosaur Hunter, and Star Wars: Dark Forces II: Jedi Knight. However, the game does have a cult following and fans had made unlicensed mods on the PC and other video game consoles. Due to its popularity, Bethesda announced during Nintendo Direct 2019 that it would sell the game digitally on the Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and Steam on November 22, 2019. However, it was delayed until March 20, 2020, so that it could be sold the same day as  Doom Eternal, the sequel to Doom (2016). It was the same game, but the lighting of the game was fixed, which was a major criticism of the N64 version of the game.

[[Mystic, Connecticut]]

The population was 4,205 at the 2010 census.

[[Reboot (fiction)]]

CATEGORIES: Comics

A reboot is a new start on a fictional universe that already exists. Some of the same themes may exist, but the story of the reboot is unrelated to earlier parts of the story. An example of this is the movie Batman Begins. Even though it is set in the Batman universe, the story has no relation to any of the earlier Batman movies made by Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher. In video games, an example of this is DmC: Devil May Cry. Even though the game is still about a half-demon named Dante, like in the first game, the game's story has no relation to the earlier Devil May Cry games, and Dante in DmC has a very different look and personality from the earlier Dante. 

A reboot is different from a remake because a remake is a retelling of a story that already exists. For example, the James Bond movie Never Say Never Again is a remake of Thunderball. Never Say Never Again is a retelling same story as Thunderball, but it is only a little different. In video games, an example of a remake is Metroid: Zero Mission, which has the same story as the first Metroid game, but it has more detailed graphics, new Power Suit abilities, and an entirely new area that is playable after the part of the game where the first game ended.

[[Bey]]

CATEGORIES: Sociology, Heads of state, Military ranks

"Bey" (بك "Beik", bej, beg, بيه "Beyeh", بیگ "Beyg" or بگ "Beg") is a traditionally Turkish title for Chieftain ruler of a Beylik, for the leaders or rulers of various sized areas in the Ottoman Empire. The equivalent title for women was Begum.

In modern times, the word is still used formally as a social title for men. It is cited after the name and is used generally with first names and not with last names.

The word entered English from Turkish bey, itself derived from Old Turkic beg, which - in the form bäg - has been mentioned as early as in the Orkhon inscriptions (8th century AD) and is usually translated as "tribal leader". The actual origin of the word is still disputed, though it is mostly agreed that it was a loan-word, in Old Turkic. This Turkic word is usually considered a borrowing from an Iranian language. However, German Turkologist Gerhard Doerfer assessed the derivation from Iranian as superficially attractive but quite uncertain, and pointed out the possibility that the word may be genuinely Turkic.

[[Executive functions]]

CATEGORIES: Cognition, Addiction

Higher animals, including humans use their brain to cotrol their behavior. The cognitive processes  they use are known as  executive functions (also called cognitive control): They are used to choose what to do, and to also control, if the chosed goals have been achieved.  Some executive functions are basic cognitive processes such as attentional control, cognitive inhibition, inhibitory control, working memory, and cognitive flexibility. Higher-order executive functions require the use of several basic executive functions and include planning and fluid intelligence (for example reasoning and problem-solving).

Executive functions develop over time. They change during lifespan of an individual and can be improved at any time. Similarly, these cognitive processes can be adversely affected by different events. 

Tests have been developed to assess the level of these functions. Rating scales can be used.  These tests are usually performed as a part of a larger series of tests, which ain to find neurological and psychiatric disorders.  An example of such a test is the Stroop test. An example of a scale is call Behaviour Rating Inventory of Excecutive functions. 

A counterexample of this is operant and classical conditioning: With these processes, individuals are "taught" to react in a certain way to a given stimulus.  In such a situation, the indivual must override the response to a stimulus using executive functions. This is called inhibitory control. The prefrontal cortex is necessary but not solely sufficient for executive functions; other parts of the brain also have a role in mediating inhibitory control.

Certain conditions affect cognitive control. These include addiction, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism, and other central nervous system disorders. Stimulus-driven behavioral responses that are associated with a particular rewarding stimulus tend to dominate one's behavior in an addiction.

[[Mister Mxyzptlk]]

CATEGORIES: DC Comics characters

Mister Mxyzptlk (m miks, ˈ), sometimes called Mxy, is a fictional impish character who appears in DC Comics' Superman comic books, sometimes as a supervillain and other times as an antihero.

Mr. Mxyzptlk was created to appear in Superman #30 (September / October 1944), in the story "The Mysterious Mr. Mxyzptlk", by writer Jerry Siegel and artist Ira Yarborough.

He is usually presented as a trickster, in the classical mythological sense, in that he possesses reality warping powers with which he enjoys tormenting Superman in a cartoonish way. In most of his appearances in DC Comics, he can be stopped only by tricking him into saying or spelling his own name backwards (Kltpzyxm - "kel-tip-zix-um"), which will return him to his home in the 5th dimension and keep him there for a minimum of ninety days. However, this specific limitation of the character has been eliminated since the Crisis on Infinite Earths reboot, upon which the character leaves only when he willingly agrees to do so after meeting some conditions he sets, such as having Superman succeed in getting Mxyzptlk to paint his own face blue.

The character appeared in live-action by Howie Mandel in the 1993 television series Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman. The character renamed Mikhail Mxyzptlk also appeared in the television series Smallville played by Trent Ford. Mxyzptlk appears in the television series Supergirl played by Peter Gadiot in the second season and by Thomas Lennon in the fifth season.

In 2009, Mister Mxyzptlk was ranked as IGN's 76th Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time.

[[Blackface]]

CATEGORIES: Cosmetics

Blackface is a kind of costume or make up which involves putting black make-up on to imitate a racist image of a Black or African American person. Blackface became popular in the 19th century especially during Reconstruction after the American Civil War.

[[.gov]]

CATEGORIES: Top-level domains, United States

August 2021

The domain name gov is the generic top-level domain used by government entities within the United States at the federal, state, and local levels. It was one of the original top-level domains, established in January 1985.

The U.S. is the only country that has a government-specific top-level domain in addition to its ccTLD. Other countries typically use a second-level domain for this purpose, e.g., .gov.au for Australia, .gov.uk for the United Kingdom, .gc.ca for Canada, and .gouv.fr for France. Since the United States controls the .gov Top Level Domain, it would be impossible for another country to create a domain ending in .gov, for example, .jp.gov.

Some U.S. federal agencies use .fed.us rather than .gov. The Department of Defense and its subsidiary organizations use .mil.  Some U.S. governmental entities use other domains, such as the use of .com domains by the United States Postal Service (usps.com) and the United States Army (goarmy.com). Internet purists consider these usages to be improper, as these are governmental or military entities rather than commercial ones.

All governments in the U.S. are allowed to use .gov, such as atlantaga.gov for the city of Atlanta, and georgia.gov for the U.S. state of Georgia.  This was not always true; under an earlier policy, only federal agencies were allowed to use the domain, and agencies beneath cabinet level were needed to use subdomains of their parent agency.

The usage of .gov as a gTLD controlled only by the U.S. is controversial, as some people believe this to be an example of arrogance by the U.S. – such views hold that usage of .fed.us or a new second-level domain of .gov.us would be more suitable. Others believe that U.S. control of .gov is a natural result of the fact that the U.S. federal government was responsible for the initial creation of the Internet and its first user.

And became the second biggest toy store behind Toys R Us, who in some areas were located nearby of other stores. In 1979, they introduced a mascot, Peter, a panda wearing overalls with his name on them. Their flagship store opened in 1989 in Framingham near the Shoppers World mall. The store was a success, and Child World attempted to change the layout of 11 other stores to match up with the store. But things started to fall for Child World in the 1990s. Toy makers stopped shipping to Child World stores, making it hard to keep toys on shelves, and many people working for Child World were fired and replaced by some people who formerly worked for Toys R Us who tried to save Child World. Child world filed for bankruptcy in May 1992 and closed half of its stores. Soon they discovered another toy store, Kiddie City, who was also having the same problems. They tried to merge Kiddie City with Child World while holding clearance sales on all 71 Child World stores. Child World says it's their only plan left of staying open. The July 12 deadline came and passed with no merger announcement, and the inventory clearance sale was now a going out of business sale. Despite this, merger talks continued in the hopes that they might be able to pull off a last-minute deal. However, on August 2, Child World announced that the plan failed and continued the process of shutting down the last 71 stores in the next 6 weeks.

In 1981, Doolittle received notice for his article in The CoEvolution Quarterly entitled "Is Nature Really Motherly?".  This was a criticism of J. E. Lovelock's formulation of the Gaia Theory. Doolittle's article is often cited by Lovelock's critics.

[[1951 Central Missouri State vs. Southwestern football game]]

CATEGORIES: College football

The 1951 Central Missouri State vs. Southwestern football game was a college football game between the Central Missouri State Mules and the Southwestern Moundbuilders. It was played on September 14, 1951. The game was played at Sonner Stadium in Winfield, Kansas. The game is known for a team rejecting a touchdown awarded by the game officials.

Central Missouri's head coach Tate C. Page called it "the finest act of sportsmanship" that he ever saw. In the third quarter, Southwestern halfback Arthur Johnson completed a long run down the sidelines nearest Southwestern's bench. The referee signaled a touchdown. The crowd of 2,000 cheered.

Southwestern's head coach Harold Hunt ran out on the field to shout, "Southwestern rejects the touchdown!" He then told the officials that Johnson had stepped out of bounds. This would undo the touchdown. None of the referees had seen this happen, but they agreed to undo the touchdown. They put the ball back to the place where Coach Hunt said Johnson had stepped out. A photo of the run later showed Coach Hunt was correct. It was published in the Winfield Daily Courier.

Referee W. P. Astle noted that there had been only three officials at the game instead of the regulation four.  He later said, "If the fourth official had been present to cover what was impossible for me to cover ... I would never have discovered the ‘biggest’ man I ever met."

Southwestern's Coach Hunt was nominated for "Football's Man of the Year" by This Week magazine. This was because he showed so much sportsmanship.

[[Topeka Constitution]]

CATEGORIES: Bleeding Kansas

The Topeka Constitutional Convention met from October 23 to Nov 11, 1855 in Topeka, Kansas Territory at Constitution Hall. It wrote the Topeka Constitution that would have made slavery in Kansas illegal. The convention was organized by Free-Staters to go against the pro-slavery Territorial legislature elected March 5, 1855. The territorial legislature was elected in polling that had a lot of electoral fraud and the intimidation of free state settlers.

The Topeka Constitution was the first effort to create a Kansas governmental structure and write its basis in law. Free-State people passed the constitution on December 15, 1855. The constitution was sent to Washington. They really wanted the U.S. Congress to pass it. President Pierce hated the document. It was presented in the Senate by Senator Lewis Cass of Michigan and in the House by Representative Daniel of Indiana. It passed the House by two votes on July 2. However, it was held in committee by the Senate. On July 8, Senator Stephen A. Douglas took up the Topeka Constitution in a bill counter to Senator Cass. Cass sent the issue back to the people of Kansas to follow the Kansas-Nebraska Act.

[[Leavenworth Constitution]]

CATEGORIES: Bleeding Kansas, 1858

The Leavenworth Constitution was one of four Kansas state constitutions written during the era of Bleeding Kansas.  The Leavenworth Constitution was written by a convention of Free-Staters. It was the most progressive of the four proposed constitutions. Important parts of this Constitution were a Bill of Rights that referred to "all men" (making no distinction between the rights of white men and black men), making slavery in the state illegal, and a basic framework for the rights of women.

The constitutional convention that wrote the Leavenworth Constitution was provided for by an act of the Territorial Legislature passed in February 1858, while the Lecompton Constitution was being debated in Congress. The constitution was adopted by the convention at Leavenworth April 3, 1858. It was also chosen by the people at an election on May 18, 1858.

The Leavenworth Constitution did not have a big impact on the history of Kansas since the US Senate did not approve of the laws in the document.  The other proposed state constitutions were the Topeka Constitution (1855), the Lecompton Constitution (1857) and the Wyandotte Constitution (1859).

[[Baseball color line]]

CATEGORIES: African-American history, History of baseball

The color line, also known as the color barrier, in American baseball stopped players of black African descent from playing Major League Baseball and its affiliated Minor Leagues until 1947 (with a few notable exceptions in the 19th century before the line was firmly established). Racial segregation in professional baseball was sometimes called a gentlemen's agreement. This means an understanding, as there was no written policy at the highest level of organized baseball, the major leagues. There was minor league's vote in 1887 against allowing new contracts with black players within its league. It sent a powerful message that eventually led to blacks not being allowed to play at all.

The color line was broken for good when Jackie Robinson signed with the Brooklyn Dodgers organization for the 1946 season.

[[Barn raising]]

CATEGORIES: Construction

A barn raising, also historically called a raising bee or rearing in the U.K., is a collective action of a community, in which a barn for one of the members is built or rebuilt by members of the community. Barn raising was common in 18th- and 19th-century rural North America. A barn was a necessary building for any farmer. Yet a barn was also a big and expensive building. Building a farm needed many people than a typical family could provide. Barn raising addressed the need by getting members of the community, unpaid, to help in the building of their neighbors' barns. Because each member was entitled to recruit others for help, the favor would eventually return to each participant.

One or more people with experience or with specific skills are chosen to lead the project. Young people helping for the first time have watched many barn raisings and know what is expected of them.

[[County seat war]]

CATEGORIES: History

A county seat war is an American phenomenon that happened mostly in the Old West as it was being settled. Although, there were similar events elsewhere, such as in southeastern Ohio. As new towns were created and county lines were drawn, there was intense competition for the status and tax benefits received by becoming a county seat. These "wars" often involved nothing more than lining up at the ballot box. However, sometimes people from a particular town would use voter fraud, intimidation or violence.

[[Pacific Railroad Acts]]

CATEGORIES: 1862 in the United States, 1864 in the United States, Trains

The Pacific Railroad Acts of 1862 were a series of acts of Congress that supported the construction of a "transcontinental railroad" (the Pacific Railroad) in the United States. This happened through authorizing issuing government bonds and the grants of land to railroad companies. The War Department under then-Secretary of War Jefferson Davis was authorized by the Congress in 1853 to do surveys of five different potential transcontinental routes from the Mississippi. These surveys ranging from north to south and submitted a massive twelve volume report to Congress with the results in early 1855. However, no route or bill could be agreed upon and passed authorizing the Government's financial support and land grants. This change when the secession of the southern states in 1861 ended their opposition to a central route. The Pacific Railroad Act of 1862 (12) was the original act. Some of its provisions were changed, expanded, or repealed by four more amending Acts: The Pacific Railroad Act of 1863 (12), Pacific Railroad Act of 1864 (13), Pacific Railroad Act of 1865 (13), and Pacific Railroad Act of 1866 (14).

The Pacific Railroad Act of 1862 started federal government land grants directly to corporations; before that act, the land grants were made to the states, for the benefit of corporations.

Donald Henry "Pee Wee" Gaskins Jr. (March 13, 1933 – September 6, 1991) was an American serial killer.  He was executed by electrocution by South Carolina in 1991.

Gaskins was born in South Carolina, the last in a string of illegitimate children.  Due to his smallness, he was nicknamed "Pee Wee".  His youth was characterized by considerable neglect; for instance, when he was one year old, he drank a bottle of kerosene.  He grew to 5 foot 2 inch and 130 pounds.

Gaskins' serial crime began before the concept was even realized, as a juvenile, which included along with a group of other youths: robberies, assaults and a gang rape.  In prison, he was regularly raped.  He escaped from prison in 1955 by sitting in the back of a garbage truck and fled to Florida; he was re-arrested, remanded and paroled in August 1961.

During the late 1960s and early 1970s, Gaskins murdered several teenaged girls and young women.  He was later found guilty of eight counts of murder and sentenced to death by South Carolina.  While on death row, Gaskins murdered a fellow death row inmate, earning him the title "Meanest Man in America".  Gaskins was put to death in the electric chair by South Carolina on September 6, 1991.

Victor Licata (c. 1912 – December 4, 1950) was an American murderer who killed most of his family with an axe.  On October 16, 1933 in Ybor City, Tampa, Florida, Licata used an axe to murder his parents, two brothers, and a sister while they were asleep. All died from blows to the head.  The killings, which were reported by the media as the work of an "axe-murdering marijuana addict", were used as prima facie evidence that there was a link between recreational drugs, such as cannabis, and crime. This led to the killings being used in 1930s anti-drug campaigns against marijuana.  At trial, Licata was found criminally insane and committed to an insane asylum, where he later hanged himself in 1950.

CATEGORIES: Prime Ministers of Crimea, 1945 births, 2019 deaths

Yuri Alexandrovich Meshkov (Юрій Олександрович Мєшков, Юрий Александрович Мешков (Yuri Alexandrovich Meshkov); October 25, 1945 – September 29, 2019)  was a Crimean politician. He was a leader of the pro-Russian movement in Crimea. Meshkov was the only President of Crimea from 1994 to 1995.

Yuri Meshkov was born on October 25, 1945 in Synelnykove, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, of the Soviet Socialist Republic of Ukraine (now Ukraine) of a mother of Ukrainian origin and a Russian father of Kossan Cossacks. He grew up in Simferopol, where he finished high school. When he was about eight years old, the Crimea region was officially transferred from the Russian RSFS to the Ukrainian SSR. For his military duties, he served in the Border Guard. In 1967 (in some sources in 1977), he graduated from the Faculty of Law of the Moscow State University. Until 1982, he worked as a detective and then as chief inspector in the district attorney's office. From 1982 to 1985, he spent time on the Skif scientific research yacht. After 1985 and until 1990, he worked privately as a legal consultant. At that time, he was also one of the heads of the "Memorial" department of the Crimean Illuminating Society "All-Union" and president of the Crimean kick-boxing Federation.

In 1990, Meshkov was elected deputy to the Supreme Council of Crimea (the parliament of the republic). There, he became the co-founder of the RDK (Republican Crimean Movement) party. In 1994, he headed the electoral block "Russia" for the Republican presidential elections, where he easily defeated Mykola Bahrov in the second round. Mykola Bahrov was at that time head of the Supreme Council of Crimea. In the second round of the presidential elections in Crimea in 1994, Meshkov won 72.9% and was elected only president of the republic.

Its main political program was to facilitate much closer relations with the Russian Federation until the possible reunification of Crimea with Russia. Mechkov tried to initiate a political-military union with Russia and completely ignored the positions of the Ukrainian government. He also tried to force the rotation of the Russian currency, issue Russian passports to the population of Crimea and even transfer Crimea to the same time zone as Moscow. Due to the unexpected resistance of the local opposition, Meshkov only managed to place his autonomous republic in the Moscow time zone. He also appointed the Deputy Prime Minister, Russian economist Yevgeny Saburov, who has practically become the head of government. He then said in confrontations with other government officials about the legitimacy of his designee that he did not even have a Ukrainian passport. Because of this, Yevgeny Saburov was forced to resign. After that, he managed to paralyze the work of the Supreme Council of Crimea.

In 1995, the Ukrainian Parliament repealed the Crimean Constitution and abolished the office of president on March 17, 1995. After some previous warnings in September and November 1994 on March 17, 1995, the President of Ukraine Leonid Kuchma , signed the law of Ukraine that repeals the amended Constitution of Crimea and some other laws of the Republic of Crimea, because they were contrary to the Constitution of Ukraine and jeopardized the sovereignty of Ukraine.

Tallulah Brockman Bankhead (January 31, 1902 – December 12, 1968) was an American actress.

Always known as just "Tallula", she was one of the most famous actresses of her time. She was born into a wealthy and influential Alabama family. Her father was a leading 'Southern Democrat', and in the 1930s became Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives. She was a childhood friend of Zelda Fitzgerald, the wife of novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald.

Tallula was an actress from the beginning to the end of her life. She acted in nearly 300 film, stage, television, and radio roles. Her personal life was wild. She struggled with alcoholism and drug addiction. She was infamous for her sex life, which included both men and women. 

Tallulah  was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame in 1972, and the Alabama Women's Hall of Fame in 1981. 

In her 1932 movie Devil and the Deep there were three major co-stars, with Tallulah  getting top billing over Gary Cooper, Charles Laughton, and Cary Grant. David O. Selznick, producer of Gone with the Wind (1939) called her the "first choice among established stars" to play Scarlett O'Hara. According to a memo from Selznick, November 11, 1936: Bankhead is first choice among established stars – and many votes coming in for her. Although her screen test for the role in black-and-white was superb, she photographed poorly in Technicolor. Selznick also thought that at age 36, she was too old to play Scarlett, who is 16 at the beginning of the film. The role eventually went to Vivien Leigh.

Also notable was her performance in the Alfred Hitchcock film Lifeboat (1943–1944). It was her best on film and won her the New York Film Critics Circle award. 

Onstage, Tallula appeared in a revival of Noël Coward's Private Lives, taking it on tour and then to Broadway for the better part of two years. The play's run made her a fortune. On her death, she was worth $2 million, a vast sum in those days.

Richard Allensworth Jewell (born Richard White; December 17, 1962 – August 29, 2007) was an American police officer and security guard. He was born in Danville, Georgia. 

He was known for working as a security guard for AT&T during the Centennial Olympic Park bombing at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia. He found a backpack filled with three pipe bombs on the park grounds, Jewell called the police and helped to evacuate the area before the bomb exploded, saving many people from injury or death. 

After the bombing, Jewell was seen as a hero but later he was viewed as a suspect, before being cleared. Jewell's case is considered an example of the damage that can be done by media reporting based on unreliable or incomplete information.

Despite never being charged, the media continued to criticize Jewell and calling him the suspected bomber. Jewell was eventually found not guilty, and Eric Rudolph was later found to have been the bomber. 

In 2006, Governor Sonny Perdue publicly thanked Jewell on behalf of the State of Georgia for saving the lives of those at the Olympics.

[[Disposable product]]

CATEGORIES: Pollution

A disposable (also called disposable product) is a product designed to be used only once, and then it would be recycled or is thrown away as solid waste. The word often implies cheapness and short-term convenience instead of something that will last for a long time. The term is also sometimes used for products that may last several months (e.g. disposable air filters) to distinguish from similar things that last forever (e.g. washable air filters).

[[Disposable and discretionary income]]

CATEGORIES: Economics, Finance

Disposable income is the income someone has after they have paid their taxes. Mathematically, it is total personal income minus personal current taxes. In national accounts definitions, personal income minus personal current taxes equals disposable personal income.

[[Autonomous consumption]]

CATEGORIES: Economics

Autonomous consumption (also exogenous consumption) is when people are paying for things when they have no income. In other words, it is the consumption expenditure that happens when income levels are zero. Such consumption is considered autonomous of income only when spending on these consumables does not change much income is changed; generally, it may be needed to pay for things that are needed and pay off debt. If income levels are actually zero, this consumption is called dissaving. This is because it is paid for by borrowing or using up savings. Autonomous consumption is different from induced consumption because it does not consistently change with income, whereas induced consumption does. The two are related, for all households, through the consumption function:

[[Consumption function]]

CATEGORIES: Macroeconomics

In economics, the consumption function shows a relationship between consumption and disposable income. It is believed that John Maynard Keynes introduced the idea in macroeconomics in 1936. He used it to develop the idea of a government spending multiplier. 

[[Induced consumption]]

CATEGORIES: Economics

Induced consumption is the part of consumption that changes with disposable income. It is when there is a change in disposable income “induces” (persuades or makes someone want to do something) a change in consumption on goods and services. In contrast, spending for autonomous consumption do not change with income. For example, spending on a consumable that is considered a normal good would be considered to be induced.

In the simple linear consumption function,

[[Ferrodraco]]

CATEGORIES: Pterosaurs

Ferrodraco lentoni,  "Lenton's Iron Dragon", is a species of pterosaur. The only known fossil of the pterosaur was found in 2017 north east of Winton, Queensland, Australia. 

The pterosaur had a wingspan of about four metres, and when on the ground walked on its four limbs. The name, Ferrodraco lentoni, comes from the Latin word, ferrum (iron), for the ironstone in which the fossil was found, and draco, the Latin word for dragon. The species also is named after Graham Thomas 'Butch' Lenton, who was the mayor of Winton. 

Only small parts of 15 different pterosaurs have been found in Australia. Ferrodraco is the most complete specimen found. Scientists have been able to identify five vertebrae, eight limb bones, a large part of the jaw and skull, and 40 teeth. They believe that the pterosaur lived about 96 million years ago. That is in the Upper Cretaceous. 

The fossil is similar to pterosaurs found in England, except that it has much smaller teeth. This might be because of the type of food it ate, perhaps a diet of fish. Bones of pterosaurs were thin, and hollow, and because of this, very few have survived. 

Winton is well known as an area where dinosaur fossils are found, but this was the first pterosaur discovered here.

[[Marginal propensity to consume]]

CATEGORIES: Economics

In economics, the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is a measurement that can put induced consumption into numbers. Induced consumption is the idea that an increase in personal consumer spending (consumption) happens with an increase in disposable income (income after taxes and transfers). The proportion of disposable income which people spend on consumption is called the propensity to consume. MPC is the proportion of more income that a person spends. For example, if a household earns one extra dollar of disposable income, and the marginal propensity to consume is 0.65, then the household will spend 65 cents and save 35 cents of that dollar. Obviously, the household cannot spend more than the extra dollar (without borrowing).

John Maynard Keynes says that the marginal propensity to consume is less than one.

The MPC is higher for poorer people than in rich.

[[Consumer spending]]

CATEGORIES: Economics

Consumer spending, consumption, or consumption expenditure is when people buy goods and services. It is the biggest part of aggregate demand in macroeconomics. There are two parts of consumer spending: induced consumption (which is changed by the level of income) and autonomous consumption (which is not).

[[Aggregate demand]]

CATEGORIES: Macroeconomics

In macroeconomics, Aggregate Demand (AD) or Domestic Final Demand (DFD) is the total demand for final goods and services in an economy at a time. This is the demand for the gross domestic product of a country. It shows the amount of goods and services that will be bought at all possible different prices.

CATEGORIES: Government buildings, National Historic Landmarks of the United States

The Eisenhower Executive Office Building, formerly known as the Old Executive Office Building, is a U.S. government building situated just west of the White House in the U.S. capital of Washington, D.C.

The building was commissioned by President Ulysses S. Grant. It was built between 1871 and 1888, on the site of the original 1800 War/State/Navy Building and the White House stables. It is built in the French Second Empire style which caused a lot of criticism at the time. It did not fit in with other government buildings in the city which were designed in the neoclassical style. Mark Twain said it was "the ugliest building in America." President Harry S. Truman called it "the greatest monstrosity in America." Historian Henry Adams called it Mullett's “architectural infant asylum.”

It is now listed as a National Historic Landmark. 

It was for years the world's largest office building, with 566 rooms and about ten acres of floor space. In 1981, work began to restore the building. The main office of the Secretary of the Navy was restored in 1987 and is now used as the ceremonial office of the Vice President of the United States.

The problem with blocking all COX is that COX-1 is also used to regulate kidney function. Blocking COX-1 runs the risk of bleeding of the stomach, and reduction of the kidney function. COX-2 inhibitors only block COX-2, and do not have an effect on COX-1..  Clinical studies have shown that they increase the risk of a heart attack, and of a stroke.  Several COX-2 inhibitors have been taken off the market, because of these side-effects. 

Other than as an analgesic, COX-2 inhibitors have also been used in the treatment of cancer, and of some neurological conditions, such as depression, and schizophrenia.

Because of the severe side-effects, COX-2 inhibitors are usually only available with a prescription.

In popular culture Hirsch is best known for his work on cultural literacy, and is the founder and chairman of the Core Knowledge Foundation. 

He is a long-term critic of American schools, and promotes ideas for improving the education of children. His The Schools We Need: And Why We Don't Have Them (1996) was hated by the liberal left. It also managed to annoy the right wing because it attacked the local control of schools. in 2016 he published  Why Knowledge Matters: Rescuing our Children from Failed Educational Theories. This outlined three major problems with education in the United States. These are, according to him, the emphasis on teaching skills, such as critical thinking skills, rather than knowledge, individualism rather than communal learning, and developmentalism, that is, teaching children what is "appropriate" for their age.

Beginning in 1990s, Hirsch began publishing books in the Core Knowledge Grader Series which the Foundation describes as "an engaging, illustrated guide to the essential knowledge outlined in the Core Knowledge Sequence". This series of books was received well by parents educating children at home, and it has been adopted by many school systems.

Sol Stern, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute who has written extensively on education reform, wrote in 2013 that Hirsch was "the most important education reformer of the past half-century."

CATEGORIES: 2010s in South America, History of Ecuador, October 2019 events

The 2019 Ecuadorian protests are an ongoing series of protests and riots against the end of fuel subsidies and austerity measures by President of Ecuador Lenín Moreno and his administration.

The protests began on 3 October 2019, as taxi, bus and truck drivers came out in protest against the planned fuel subsidy abolition. Indigenous peoples groups joined the protests shortly thereafter, along with university students and labour unions. The protesters declared their plan to hold an indefinite general strike, which would last until the government overturned its decision. 

President Moreno declared a state of emergency on October 4, 2019, amid nationwide protests against a hike in fuel prices. The protests had weakened the country's transport network with all major roads and bridges blocked in the capital Quito.

Shortly thereafter, President Lenín Moreno refused to discuss a potential reversal of the fuel plans and called protesting crowds as "criminals".

On 8 October 2019, President Moreno said his government had relocated to the coastal city of Guayaquil after anti-government protesters had overrun the capital Quito. On the same day, President Moreno accused his predecessor Rafael Correa of creating a coup against the government with the help of Venezuela's Nicolás Maduro, a charge which Correa denied.

During the late-night hours of 13 October, the Ecuadorian government and CONAIE reached an agreement during a televised negotiation. Both parties agreed to collaborate on new economic measures to combat overspending and debt. The austerity measures were reversed.

They are: Ann Perkins (Rashida Jones), Mark Brendanawicz (Paul Schneider), Tom Haverford (Aziz Ansari), Ron Swanson (Nick Offerman), April Ludgate (Aubrey Plaza), Andy Dwyer (Chris Pratt), Ben Wyatt (Adam Scott), Chris Traeger (Rob Lowe), Jerry Gergich (Jim O'Heir), Donna Meagle (Retta), and Craig Middlebrooks (Billy Eichner).

The series changed as time went on. The writers wanted to make the show like real life. To do this, they learned about how governments of cities really worked. They also talked about current political issues in episodes of the show. For example, one episode has the government of Pawnee shut down. This means that there is not enough money for the government to work correctly, so it stops doing everything that is not very important. The writers put this in the show because of a real government shutdown. The real shutdown happened because of a financial crisis in 2007-2008, and this was the same time that the episode was being written. Sometimes, real politicians also acted on the show. Joe Biden, John McCain, and Michelle Obama were some of the politicians who did this. The characters in the show also changed. Some people watched the first season and thought that Leslie Knope was too ditzy—that is, unintelligent and unable to do her job correctly. So the writers changed the way they showed Leslie. They wanted viewers to know she really was smart. During the show, many of the characters have changing romantic relationships and get different jobs. They changed just like people change in real life.

The first season only had six episodes. It got mixed reviews. People thought some things about it were good, and some things about it were bad. Many people thought it was too much like The Office. Like Parks and Recreation, The Office was another sitcom that Daniels created. But after the first season, it got positive reviews. Many people thought it was good, and it won many awards. It was nominated for an Emmy Award 14 times. It was also nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series—Musical or Comedy. It won a Golden Globe Award for the good job Poehler 

did playing Leslie Knope.

[[Drosophilidae]]

CATEGORIES: Drosophila

The Drosophilidae is a huge, widespread  (cosmopolitan) family of flies, which includes the famous fruit flies. The family has over 4000 species in 75 genera. A recent publication lists the species:

There is another unrelated family of flies, the Tephritidae, which includes species also known as "fruit flies".

The best known species of the Drosophilidae is Drosophila melanogaster. This species and its relatives are often used for studies on  genetics, development, physiology, and behaviour.

D. melanogaster is not so much studied in the field as in the laboratory. The best-known studies of Drosophila in a natural environment was done by Dobzhansky and colleagues on Drosophila pseudoobscura from the early 1930s to  1970. Reprints and discussions are in Lewontin et al 2003, and theoretical discussions in Dobzhansky, 1970.

The cells of fruit flies usually do not divide after the imago is hatched. The fruit fly is mostly composed of post-mitotic cells, has a very short lifespan, and shows gradual ageing. As in other species, temperature influences the life history of the animal. They live longer in colder weather. Several genes can be manipulated to extend the lifespan of these insects.

The Drosophilidae has two subfamilies, the Drosophilinae and the Steganinae.

[[Steganinae]]

CATEGORIES: Drosophila

[[Drosophilinae]]

CATEGORIES: Drosophila

The Drosophilinae are the largest subfamily in the Drosophilidae. The other subfamily is the Steganinae.

A huge amount of research has shown the way the fly has evolved many species as it spread across the world.

The genus Drosophila is paraphyletic because several genera (with many species), such as Zaprionus, Scaptomyza and Lordiphosa, are within the genus. What this means is that they have evolved from more standard Drosophila over time. This is pretty well supported by the evidence of their genome.

In taxonomy, there are two ways of solving this kind of problem:

Genus Drosophila could be raised to a supergenus, or the related offshoot genera could be demoted to subgenera.

[[Sugarcane juice]]

CATEGORIES: Drinks, Syrup

Sugarcane juice is the liquid extracted from pressed sugarcane. Especially, in places where sugarcane is grown commercially, it is a popular drink. Today, most sugarcane comes from Southeast Asia, India, Northern Africa, and Latin America. In Spanish-speaking countries, sugarcane juice is usually called Guarapo, or guarapa. In Portugese, it is called garapa. These names can also refer to palm syrup. 

In the United States where processed sugarcane syrup is used as a sweetener in food and beverage manufacturing,  the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers "evaporated cane juice" to be a misleading term for "sugar" on product labels. The FDA regards "juice" as a liquid derived from fruits or vegetables, so the preferred term is "cane sugar".

In Brazil, laboratories use sugarcane juice to make ethanol fuel.

Biography 

Erwin Rafael “Winchi” Contreras was born on 9 July 1966 in Benque Viejo del Carmen, Cayo District in the then, British Honduras. 

Contreras is currently second in the Line of succession to Prime minister Dean Barrow who will retire as Prime minister on 1 April 2020 behind Deputy prime minister, Patrick Faber. He belongs to the UDP. In addition, Barrow has also decided not to seek another term in his Queen’s Square constituency and will officially resign from Electoral politics on 2 November 2020, once the results for the 2020 general election is out. On 7 February 2006, Barrow told 7 News that he will resign if the UDP losses the upcoming Municipal elections. Contreras was at that time one of the two choices who would succeed Barrow as Leader of the UDP, if he were to resign then. The other choice was Shadow Minister of Police and the Army, Michael Finnegan. After the UDP won the 2006 municipal election, Barrow kept his promise and remained as UDP Leader.

Contreras is a former member of the Belize national football team. He first joined the team in 1993. After a determined training, he played in both of Belize’s 1998 Wold Cup qualification games against Panama in March 1996. Although, his team made it through the qualification Round. They would eventually lose the World Cup that year. After the loss for his team, Contreras announced his resignation from the Team and that he no longer aspires to enter the Soccer arena. He also said that he will be looking for another opportunity to serve the People of Belize. 

Electoral history 

Contreras first joined the UDP in 1997 when he submitted his Nomination to contest the UDP Standard Bareer convention and election in Cayo West against Guillermo Valdez, who contested the 1993 election under the UDP ticket. Contreras had the support of Prime minister, Manuel Esquivel and Former UDP Leader, Dean Lindo, while Valdez was backed by Deputy prime minister, Barrow and Minister of Police and the Army, Michael Finnegan (Belizean politician). In the end, Contreras won 1,537 votes to Valdez’s 1,527 votes. Contreras then prepared himself to face Amin Hegar of the People’s United Party (PUP) in the 1998 Belizean general election who had been the MP for Cayo West for over five years. Contreras had a disadvantage and new that the road to Cayo West was not easy. He was even criticised for “lack of experience”. When Esquivel called the election, Contreras led his People in a March from Cinderella Plaza through downtown Belize City to the Island. It was a very Successful March which energised his Party. After the March concluded, Lindo spoke to News 5 and said that he has full confidence that Contreras will win and deliver Cayo West for his People. Public support for Contreras indicated that he was going to win his Constituency with a Landslide victory. However that all changed on Election Day. It was found that Contreras had allegedly handed out leases to over four hundred lots on Election Day and this constituted Bribery under the Election laws. The written Opinion in the case has not yet been released. After a determined Campaign, Contreras emerged Victorious, gaining 1,537 votes to Hegar’s 1,527 votes retiring the one term MP. Bucking a National trend, Contreras as the Only UDP Candidate to defeat a PUP House Incumbent In 1998 and one of the only three UDP members elected nationwide that Year. After the UDP’s Landslide lost in the 1998 election, Esquivel resigned as UDP Leader and the Party had only three suitable candidates for the post. A The first being Front-runner, Barrow who was considered favourite in the race and the others being, Finnegan and Contreras. Both declined the offer to run for Party Leader and instead Contreras submitted his Nomination to run for Second Deputy Leader of the UDP and so the Party had no other option but to elect Barrow as their Leader. Barrow formed his Shadow cabinet comprising with just three Opposition Ministers. He appointed Contreras as Shadow Minister of Economic Development, Investment and Traderesponsible for aguing with Minister, Ralph Fonseca on issues concerning the Budget planning and management, Economic development, Investment and Trade. Contreras discharged his duties in the portfolio faithfully and eagerly. In 1999, he provided free Petrol to cars in his Constituency and reduced the sales of Vechicals by $1000. As a result, many of his constituents were able to afford them. In 2000, he officially opened a Sewing shop in Benque Viejo del Carmen. Soon the 2003 general election came, and it was time for Contreras to secure another term in Cayo West. He was endorsed unopposed as Standard-Bareer for the Constituency In 2002. He then went on to go neck-a-neck against PUP Newcomer Kendall Mendez. During the campaign, Contreras sited his major Achievements in his first term and embodied the road ahead for Cayo West. Contreras was once again Victorious In Cayo West, acquiring 2,180 votes to beat Mendez, whose votes totalled 1,800. Although Cayo West remained a UDP Stronghold, it lost the election that year and was sent back to opposition. This time with a larger Shadow cabinet of 7 ministers, Barrow selected Contreras to be Shadow Minister of Economic Development, Shadow Minister of Commerce, Industry and Consumer Protection. This time with double the responsibilities. In 2005, Contreras wrote a stimulase plan on how to tackle the Economic downfall and create more industries. Two issues that the Musa Administration failed to Address during his 10-year term. The UDP was on

A multirole combat aircraft (MRCA) is a military airplane designed for more than one purpose. A multirole fighter is a multirole combat aircraft that can be used to attack enemy airplanes.

The term "multirole" is the ability for the airplane to perform more than one task or combat role. Many times airplanes will be designed for one task, and later someone will make small changes to the airplane to perform a different task. For example, the F-15 Eagle was first designed as an air superiority fighter to destroy other enemy fighters. Many years later its designers made changes to allow it to carry bombs and missiles and attack targets on the ground. 

There are many roles that combat airplanes may fill:

[[North-South divide in Taiwan]]

CATEGORIES: Taiwan

North-South divide in Taiwan is made out of Taiwanese government's long-term over-investment in northern Taiwan that led to imbalance in economic development, political authority, medical access, educational supply, savings, and other kind of inequalities between northern and southern Taiwan. Because of this imbalances, southern Taiwanese often feel they're not fairly treated by the government.

In Taiwan, best schools and educational institutions supported by Taiwanese government are based in northern Taiwan. If you're southern Taiwanese wanting to study deeper, you will need to go to northern Taiwan. If you're an engineer or manager in a company, you will often need to go to northern Taiwan to update your knowledge.

From 1980 to 2000 in Taiwan, money that is paid, usually every month, to an employee was getting higher and higher leading to a tendency that companies moved out of Taiwan.

At the same time, many companies, who were able to earn more and thus pay more to their employees, started to grow in Taiwan. These companies made higher-value-added products and offered jobs needing college education not the kind of work that needs physical skills or strength in the past. Because Taiwan's higher educational institutions were near Taipei City, Taiwan, these new companies liked to go to northern Taiwan to run businesses.

Before 1980, Taiwan's main industries were farming, fishing, light industries and heavy industries. Taiwan was under Japanese rule from 1895 till 1945. Thanks to Japanese's policy that equally distributed resources for economic development, southern Taiwanese could find a job near their home in that time and even in the early time of the governance by KMT who succeeded Japanese to rule Taiwan since 1945.
