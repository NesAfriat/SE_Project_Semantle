[[Royalty payment]]

CATEGORIES: Economics

A royalty is a payment made to someone for the use of something, an asset, that they have created or own. For example a musician who writes a song is paid a royalty each time the song is played on the radio, or each time another musician plays the song. The owner can allow other people to use their asset by paying a license or a franchise. The amount paid is usually a percentage of the all the money made from using the asset, the gross, or from the just the profit, the net. Another way is to set a fixed price, for example a set amount for each book or recording. There are many other ways that the royalty fee can be calculated and paid. A royalty interest is the right to collect a stream of future royalty payments.

A license agreement defines the terms for these payments. The agreement can also set conditions for how, where and when an asset can be used. License agreements can also be regulated. A government of a country might receive royalty payments for mining, or extracting oil, and would protect its interest in the agreement with laws.

[[Shill]]

CATEGORIES: Words, Psychology, Advertising, Crime

A shill is a 'plant' or stooge. They are people, usually paid, who promote something while pretending to be independent.

Shills publicly help or give credibility to a person or organization with which they have a private relationship. Shills operate in media, journalism, marketing, confidence games, or other business areas. A shill may also discredit opponents or critics of their client  by character assassination or other means.

Usually, shill refers to someone who purposely gives onlookers, or marks, the impression of an enthusiastic customer. They pretend independence of the seller, marketer or con artist, for whom they are secretly working. 

The shill works for the man who does the tricks to extract money from the onlookers. The arena can be as basic as a street three-shell game, or as complex as a massive stock exchange fraud. All it takes is someone who looks like a fellow player to show big appreciation of the seller's product.

The shill and his client ("the man") rely on crowd psychology to encourage other onlookers or audience members to do business with the seller or accept the ideas they are promoting.  With a big audience, such as a magician's show or a political rally, there are placed people in the audience very often. Then the shill is called a plant or stooge.

What the shill does is similar or identical to what advertising and public relations do. However, it is more obvious that the latter have a vested interest because everyone knows they are being paid for their work. Another place for shilling is the many web auctions.

The Zodiac Killer or Zodiac was a serial killer who operated in Northern California from at least the late 1960s to the early 1970s. The killer's identity remains unknown. The Zodiac murdered victims in Benicia, Vallejo, Lake Berryessa, and San Francisco between December 1968 and October 1969. Four men and three women between the ages of 16 and 29 were targeted. The killer originated the name "Zodiac" in a series of taunting letters sent to the local Bay Area press. These letters included four cryptograms (or ciphers). Of the four cryptograms sent, only one has been definitively solved.

Suspects have been named by law enforcement and amateur investigators, mainly led by Dave Toschi, but no conclusive evidence has surfaced. The San Francisco Police Department (SFPD) marked the case "inactive" in April 2004, but re-opened it at some point prior to March 2007. The case also remains open in the city of Vallejo, as well as in Napa County and Solano County. The California Department of Justice has maintained an open case file on the Zodiac murders since 1969.

[[Upland and lowland]]

CATEGORIES: Physical geography, Ecology

Upland and lowland are terms used in ecology, physical geography and geology. They describe the relative height of land above sea level.

Uplands have rivers and streams which are fast-flowing, clear, and with plenty of oxygen. They drain high or mountainous country, and go down into broad plains (where they become lowland rivers. Lowlands usually have warmer, slow-flowing waters carrying lots of sediment and with poor oxygen content.

Upland rivers run fast and cut through rock (Colorado River). Lowland rivers meander slowly towards the coast (Mississippi River). They carry lots of soil and are a dark colour. Therefore the fish and other animals which live in the river are quite different according to the two stages or types of river.

The terms also apply to large areas of land. Because mountain-building (orogeny) lifts up huge sections of the Earth, there are large areas which are well above sea level: the highlands. But on the trailing edge of a continent, the land is low. So the Americas are (broadly speaking) high on the west (the American Cordillera) and low on the east (Amazon, St. Lawrence River / Great Lakes basin, Mississippi, and La Plata). This is a consequence of plate tectonics, as the Americas have moved slowly west for over 100 million years. The Appalachians are a far older chain of ground-down mountains carried along by the continent as it moved west.

The same pattern can be seen in other continents, especially with great rivers such as the Congo and the Indus. Australia is the exception: its mountain ranges are very ancient and worn down. Recent plate tectonics there has not been so significant as elsewhere.

[[Anna Sewell]]

CATEGORIES: 1820 births, 1878 deaths, English children's writers, English novelists, People from Norfolk

Anna Sewell (30 March 1820 – 25 April 1878) was an English novelist. She is best known as the author of the 1877 novel Black Beauty, one of the top ten best selling novels for children ever written.

Anna Sewell was born  in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk. After a childhood injury, she was confined to her house, and got around largely by carriage horse. Sewell spent her last years writing the children's classic Black Beauty (1877), a fictional autobiography of a gentle, highbred horse. She died of hepatitis in 1878, just five months after her book was published.

Sewell’s concern for the humane treatment of horses began early in life. Crippled at a young age, she had difficulty walking, but she could drive a horse-drawn carriage. Her father took the train to work, and she drove her father to and from the station. Later, after reading an essay on animals by Horace Bushnell, she stated that one of her goals in writing was “to induce kindness, sympathy, and an understanding treatment of horses.”

Sewell’s introduction to writing began in her youth when she helped edit the works of her mother—a deeply religious, popular author of juvenile best-sellers. Sewell spent the last seven or eight years of her life—confined to her house as an invalid—writing Black Beauty. The book, a fictional autobiography of a gentle highbred horse, had a strong moral purpose. It may have helped abolish the cruel practice of using the checkrein.

CATEGORIES: United Nations, Human rights

Discussions of LGBT rights at the United Nations have included resolutions and joint statements in the United Nations General Assembly and the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC). 

Since its founding in 1945, the United Nations political bodies had not discussed LGBT rights (regarding equality regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity) until September 1995.  In the negotiations on the Draft of the 1995 Beijing Platform for Action, sexual orientation became a topic of debate at the 4th World Conference on Women. These discussions on "sexual orientation" can not be found in the text of the meetings.  Nevertheless, it was the first time governments had an explicit opinion in favour or against the inclusion and recognition of sexual orientation. Beverley Palesa Ditsie became the first openly lesbian person to address the United Nations regarding LGBT issues, calling for States to adopt resolutions that recognized sexual diversity. 

[[Indian Penal Code]]

CATEGORIES: India, Law

The Indian Penal Code (IPC) is the main criminal code of modern India. It is a code meant to cover all aspects of criminal law. The code was drafted on 6th October 1860. on the recommendation of first law commission  of india established in 1834 under the charter Act of 1833 under the chairmanship of Thomas Babington Macaulay.It came into force in British India during the early British Raj period in 1862. However, it did not apply automatically in the Princely states. They had their own courts and legal systems until the 1940s. The Code has been amended several times and is now supplemented by other criminal provisions.

After the Partition of the British Indian Empire, the Indian Penal Code was inherited by its successor states, the Dominion of India and the Dominion of Pakistan (where it continues as the Pakistan Penal Code). The Ranbir Penal Code (RPC) for Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir is also based on this code. After the separation of Bangladesh from Pakistan, the code continued in force there. The code was also adopted by the British colonial authorities in colonial Burma, Ceylon (modern Sri Lanka), the Straits Settlements (now part of Malaysia), Singapore and Brunei. It is the basis of the criminal codes in those countries.

[[Sex work]]

CATEGORIES: Prostitution

Carol Leigh first used the terms sex worker and sex work in 1978, to refer to prostitution, and related concepts. By using this new term, Leigh wanted to avoid the negative connotations. Sex work is paid work in the industry, such as prostitution, erotic dancing, and starring in pornographic movies. It does not refer to related illegal activities, such as human trafficking or other non-consensual sex.

It is difficult to say how many sex workers there are. This is because of the stigma of being a sex worker. In addition, most academic work focuses on prostitution, escorts and exotic dancing; there is little research on other forms of sex work.

[[Jus soli]]

CATEGORIES: Philosophical concepts

Jus soli (lang), means "right of the soil". This is often called birthright citizenship. This is the right of anyone born in a country to have nationality or citizenship.

Jus soli was part of the common law. It was different to jus sanguinis, from the Roman law that became part of the civil-law systems of continental Europe. Where it exists, there are often conditions.  For example, some countries deny citizenship to children of foreign diplomats. 

Almost all states in Europe, Asia, Africa and Oceania grant citizenship at birth based upon the principle of jus sanguinis (right of blood). Citizenship is inherited through parents not by birthplace. Sometimes it can be a version of jus soli in which citizenship by birthplace is automatic only for the children of certain immigrants.

[[Transcriptome]]

CATEGORIES: RNA

The transcriptome is the set of all RNA molecules in one cell or a population of cells. RNA transcribes the base sequence from DNA by the process called transcription. The term 'transcriptome' is sometimes used to refer to all RNAs, or just mRNA, depending on the particular experiment. 

It includes only those RNA molecules found in a particular cell population. It usually includes the amount or concentration of each RNA molecule, and the molecular identities. It differs from the exome: that refers only to the bits of RNA which do code for proteins.

In the human genome, about 5% of all genes get transcribed into RNA. 

The transcriptome is coding mRNA (about 1-4% of its entirety) and non-coding RNAs (the rest}. Non-coding RNAs do not give rise to proteins. The number of non-protein-coding sequences increases in more complex organisms.

[[Exome]]

CATEGORIES: RNA

The exome is the part of the genome composed of exons. In RNA, introns are removed by RNA splicing. That leaves the sections of the RNA which actually code for the final protein. Exome sequencing is the way researchers find the causes of many inherited diseases.

[[Grammatical number]]

CATEGORIES: Linguistics

Grammatical number is the way numbers and counting are fitted into sentences.

[[Insertion sort]]

CATEGORIES: Searching and sorting algorithms

In computer science, insertion sort is a method of sorting data, such as numbers, one item at a time. It is not a very efficient method compared to other algorithms such as quicksort. However, it is a very simple algorithm that is easy to build.

Think about the sequence of numbers in the picture below. It starts with a small number (written as ≤x), then a big number (≥x) and then a medium sized number (written as x). If this had specific numbers, it might start with 2 (small), 10 (big), 4 (medium). The number 10 is bigger than the number 4. So if the sequence were in order from smallest to biggest, it should start with 2, 4, 10. So the second and third numbers should be swapped. So, in the example below, the sequence should start with ≤x, x, ≥x. 

When the sequence it sorted, the medium number is moved in between the small (≤x) and big (≥x) numbers. So the sequence becomes:

[[Messier 32]]

CATEGORIES: Elliptical galaxies, Local galaxies

Messier 32 (also known as NGC 221) is a dwarf "early-type" galaxy about 2.65 million light-years from Earth. It is seen in the constellation Andromeda.  

M32 is a satellite galaxy of the large Andromeda Galaxy (M31). It was discovered by Guillaume Le Gentil in 1749. M32 measures 6.5 ± 0.2 thousand light-years in diameter at the widest point.

The galaxy is a compact elliptical galaxy type. Compact ellipticals are rather rare.

Half the stars are inside an effective radius of only 100 parsecs.

Densities in the central area increase steeply, over 3×107 M⊙ pc−3 as seen by the HST. The half-light radius of this central star cluster is around 6 parsec.  In other words, this small centre of the galaxy emits half the light of the central 100 parsecs.

Like more ordinary elliptical galaxies, M32 contains mostly older faint red and yellow stars with practically no dust or gas and consequently no current star formation. It does, however, show hints of star formation in the relatively recent past.

M32 contains a supermassive black hole.

Its mass is between 1.5 and 5 million solar masses.

[[Barnard's galaxy]]

CATEGORIES: Barred spiral galaxies

Barnard's galaxy  (also known as NGC 6822, IC 4895, or Caldwell 57) is an irregular barred spiral galaxy. It is about 1.6 million light-years away, in the constellation Sagittarius.  

The galaxy is part of the Local Group of galaxies. It was discovered by E.E. Barnard in 1884 with a six-inch refractor telescope.  

The galaxy is one of the closest to the Milky Way.  It is similar in structure and makeup to the Small Magellanic Cloud. It is about 7,000 light-years in diameter.

The galaxy is famous because it is where cepheid variables were used to find out how far away the galaxy was. Edwin Hubble found 11 cepheid variable stars, and used them to find the distance to the galaxy. This settled a great debate in the 1920s about the scale of the universe and the nature of spiral galaxies. It became clear that all "spiral nebulae" were in fact spiral galaxies. They are far outside our own Milky Way.

[[Bose gas]]

CATEGORIES: Quantum mechanics

Bose gas is a concept in quantum mechanics.

Classical mechanics has a concept called ideal gas. This concept describes how a gas usually behaves, in different settings. A bose gas is the analogous concept in quantum mechanics. 

A bose gas is made of bosons with a positive spin value. These bosons also follow the Bose-Einstein statistics. The statistical mechanics of bosons were developed by Satyendra Nath Bose for photons.  Albert Einstein extended the theory, when he realized that an ideal gas of bosons would form a condensate at a low enough temperature. This condensate is known as a Bose–Einstein condensate. This is not the case with  a classical ideal gas.

[[Cordaitales]]

CATEGORIES: Gymnosperms

Cordaitales are an extinct order of woody plants that may have been early conifers. Alternatively, they may have given rise to the conifers (Pinophyta), ginkgos (Ginkgophyta) and cycads (Cycadophyta).

Also, some tall trees and some shrubby mangrove-like species of Cordaitales seem to have grown in the Carboniferous coal swamps. Cordaitales were also abundant during the Permian, but became less important during the Triassic. They died out during the time of the end-Triassic mass extinction. 

Many Cordiatales had elongated strap-like leaves, resembling some modern-day conifers of the Araucariaceae and Podocarpaceae. 

[[Podocarpaceae]]

CATEGORIES: Gymnosperms

Podocarpaceae is a large family of mainly Southern Hemisphere conifers. There are about 156 species of evergreen trees and shrubs. It has up to 19 genera. The distribution of this family suggests its early evolution took place in the ancient southern continent of Gondwana.

The family is a member of the Antarctic flora. Its main centres of diversity are in Australasia, particularly New Caledonia, Tasmania, and New Zealand. They are also in Malesia and South America (mainly in the Andes mountains).

Several genera extend north of the equator into Indochina and the Philippines. Podocarpus goes as far north as southern Japan and southern China in Asia, and Mexico in the Americas, and Nageia into southern China and southern India. Two genera also occur in sub-Saharan Africa, the widespread Podocarpus and the endemic Afrocarpus.

Parasitaxus usta is unique as the only known parasitic gymnosperm. It occurs on New Caledonia, where it is parasitic on another member of the Podocarpaceae, Falcatifolium taxoides.

A few months before she was born, her mother was in a shipwreck. Many people died, but her mother was saved by the king's brother. In a dream the night after her rescue, she was told that she was saved because the child in her womb was very special, and was a gift from God. After Bridget was born, she wanted to live her life as a holy woman, but it was hard, because she was one of only two surviving children in her family. When she was 14 years old, she was forced to marry 18-year-old Ulf Gudmarsson. This was hard for her because she believed that staying a virgin would be the closest state to God. 

After Ulf died, God sent a message to tell Bridget to come to Rome. That same year, Bridget packed up her bags and headed off to Rome, never to return to her hometown again. In 1370, Pope Urban V made her religious group official. She eventually became famous for helping to restoring the papacy in Rome.

Sir Arthur Stanley Eddington GBR (28 December 1882 – 22 November 1944) was an important English scientist. He was an astronomer, physicist, and mathematician in the early 20th century.

Eddington did his greatest work in astrophysics. He was also a philosopher of science and a populariser of science. The Eddington limit is named after him. It is the natural limit to the luminosity of stars, or the radiation generated by accretion onto a compact object (which is what causes the luminosity). 

Around 1920, he anticipated the discovery and mechanism of nuclear fusion in stars. This was published in his paper "The Internal Constitution of the Stars". At that time, the source of stellar energy was a complete mystery; Eddington was the first to correctly speculate that the source was fusion of hydrogen into helium.

He is also famous for his work on the theory of relativity. Eddington wrote a number of articles that explained Einstein's theory of general relativity to the English-speaking world. World War I severed many lines of scientific communication and new developments in German science were not well known in England.  He also conducted an expedition to observe the solar eclipse of 29 May 1919. That gave one of the earliest confirmations of general relativity.The observations showed that light from stars which passed close by the Sun was slightly bent towards the Sun. This was predicted by the general theory of relativity. He became known for his popular expositions and interpretations of the theory.

[[FOXP2]]

CATEGORIES: Genetics

FOXP2 is a gene which codes for a protein needed for speech and language.

It codes for "Forkhead box protein P2", which is needed for the proper development of speech and language in humans. Versions of this gene occur in many vertebrates, where it generally plays a role in communication (for instance, the development of bird song).

FOXP2 is the first gene found which affects speech and language.  The gene is more active in females than in males. In humans, mutations of FOXP2 cause a severe speech and language disorder. 

FOXP2 is popularly dubbed the "language gene", but this is only partly correct since there are other genes involved in language development. It directly regulates a number of other genes, including CNTNAP2, CTBP1, and SRPX2.

Two amino acid substitutions distinguish the human FOXP2 protein from that found in chimpanzees.  Evidence suggests that these changes affect the functions of FOXP2.

[[Cryptocurrency]]

CATEGORIES: Cryptocurrency

A cryptocurrency is a type of currency which uses digital files as money. Usually, the files are created using the same ways as cryptography (the science of hiding information). Digital signatures can be used to keep the transactions safe, and let other people check that the transactions are real. The first cryptocurrencies were made to be free of government-given currencies.

Cryptocurrencies use 'decentralized control', which means that they aren't controlled by one person or government. This is different to 'centralized' electronic money and central banks. The control of each cryptocurrency works through a distributed ledger (a list of transactions shared by everyone), usually a blockchain, that serves as a public financial transaction database.

Bitcoin, first released as open-source software in 2009, is often called the first decentralized cryptocurrency. Since then, over 4,000 cryptocurrencies (sometimes called altcoins, which is short for alternative coins) have been created.

[[Duodecimal]]

CATEGORIES: Numerals, Systems

The duodecimal system (also known as base 12, dozenal, or rarely uncial) is the number system with a base of twelve. In the duodecimal system, large numbers are expressed by groups of 12. For example, the number fifty (which we usually write as 50) would be written as 42 in the dozenal system, since it is equal to 4×12+2.

The number 12 is the smallest number that has four factors (2, 3, 4, 6). If one divide the numbers 10 and 12 with 3, the results will be 3.333... and 4, respectively. Doing the same thing with 6, the results will be 1.666... and 2. So, the duodecimal system can control the fractions better than the decimal system.

Goods or services where the price changes a lot are said to have a high volatility, those that don't have a low volatility. The word come from the Latin verb "volare" meaning "to fly".

In the securities markets, volatility is often associated with big swings in either direction. For example, when the stock market rises and falls more than one percent over a sustained period of time, it is called a "volatile" market. An asset's volatility is a key factor when pricing options contracts. In statistical terms, volatility is the standard deviation of a market or security’s annualised returns over a given period - essentially the rate at which its price increases or decreases. Historical volatility is calculated using a series of past market prices, while implied volatility looks at expected future volatility, using the market price of a market-traded derivative like an option.

[[Short (finance)]]

CATEGORIES: Finance, Stock market

To short an asset means to bet that the asset will lose value, or that the current price is overvalued (higher than its supposed value). If the asset in question does indeed lose value, the person who shorted it will win the bet, and make a profit.

This can be done by borrowing assets and selling them at a higher price, returning the asset once you can buy it back at a lower price. 

For example, if you think that Tesla stocks will lose 10% of the value, you could short the stock, and make a 10% profit once it goes down by 10%. However, if Tesla stock gains value, than you will lose the equivalent amount.

[[Blockchain]]

CATEGORIES: Computer science, Cryptocurrency

A Blockchain (or block chain) is a method of storing a list of entries, which cannot be changed easily after they are created.  This also applies to the list.  This is done by using several concepts from cryptography, including digital signatures and hash functions. In very basic terms, a blockchain combines the following two ideas:

In most cases, a blockchain is managed by a peer-to-peer network. All peers use a common protocol that specifies how they should communicate with each other, how a new block is created and validated. Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be changed easily any more. Changing the block means all the blocks after it need to be changed as well. Depending on the protocol, this will require a majority of the peers, or even all the peers, to agree.

Blockchains are secure by design. Blockchain technology is used where keeping a correct record is important. Use cases include  medical records, identity management, food traceability, and voting.

Blockchain was invented by Stuart Haber and Scott Stornetta in 1991 as a means to assure the integrity of digital records. Haber and Stornetta launched the world's first commercial blockchain; Surety in 1995.

In 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto included as references 3 and 4 of Bitcoin: A Peer to Peer Electronic Cash System, the two papers by Haber and Stornetta   to serve as the public transaction ledger of the cryptocurrency bitcoin.  Because of its blockchain, bitcoin became the first digital currency to solve the double-spending problem without the need of a trusted authority or central server.  The bitcoin design has inspired other applications.

The Turk, also known as the Mechanical Turk or Automaton Chess Player was a trick chess-playing machine. First put on show in 1770, the machine was in use until it was destroyed in a fire in 1854. It was later found to be a hoax. It was built in 1770 by Wolfgang von Kempelen to impress the Empress Maria Theresa of Austria. The machine could play chess against a human. It could also perform the knight's tour, a puzzle where a player moves a knight to every square of a chessboard exactly once.

The Turk was not a real machine, but a mechanical illusion. There was a person inside the machine working the controls. With a skilled chess player hidden inside the box, the Turk won most of the games. It played and won games against many people including Napoleon Bonaparte and Benjamin Franklin. The chess players who secretly worked inside the box included Johann Allgaier, Hyacinthe Henri Boncourt, Aaron Alexandre, William Lewis, Jacques Mouret, and William Schlumberger.

[[Knight's tour]]

CATEGORIES: Chess, Puzzles

A knight's tour is a set of moves of a knight on a chessboard. The knight visits every square only once.

[[Mod (video games)]]

CATEGORIES: Video games

A video game mod is a change made to a video game. The word mod is short for modification. A mod can be a change to any part of a game, including how it sounds, how it plays, the way it looks, or anything else. They are usually created by fans of a game instead of the people who made the original game. Mods are usually put on the internet for free when they are released.

Mods can be as small or as large as the creators want it to be. They can be minor bug fixes, or they can change so many things that they become a completely different game. Large mods like that are sometimes called total conversions. Some popular examples of total conversion mods that became separate video games are Counter-Strike, Team Fortress, and Killing Floor. 

Mods can help a game become more famous and successful. Many people think that good mods can make a game more fun and interesting than the original. Some video game companies saw this and decided to give mod creators tools to help them make even more mods. Examples of companies that have done this are id Software, Valve Corporation, Mojang AB, and Bethesda Softworks.

Sometimes, a mod of a game might become just as popular as the original game, or more popular. When this happens, the word vanilla is often used to talk about the original game without mods.

[[Data Center Cooling]]

Data cooling is one of the most fundamental  IT environment processes especially when it concerns a data center. As the new computer hardware becomes more compact while using the same amount or at times more electricity than the one that has been replaced, more heat is being produced inside the data centers. For collecting and transferring the remaining heat energy to the external atmosphere, accurate air conditioning and heat removal equipment is needed. The main goal is to transfer and transport unutilized heat energy from the IT environment to the external atmosphere.

Monitoring our service in real-life situations can be proved most of the times also equally important. With specific environmental sensors we can regulate,monitor and control data center’s temperature, airflow and hotspots and in general be aware of the quality of the “internal” environment and temperature in the data center.

A computer room air conditioning (CRAC) unit is an apparatus that controls and maintains environmental features in the data center like temperature and humidity. While CRAC units makes use of mechanical refrigeration, a computer room air handler (CRAH) uses fans, cooling coils and a water-chiller system to remove heat.

[[Council of Foreign Ministers]]

CATEGORIES: 1945

Council of Foreign Ministers was an organisation agreed upon at the Potsdam Conference in 1945 and announced in the Potsdam Agreement.

The Potsdam Agreement specified that the Council would be composed of the Foreign Ministers of the United Kingdom, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, China, France, and the United States. It would normally meet in London (at Lancaster House) and the first meeting was to take place no later than 1 September 1945. As the immediate important task, the Council was authorised to draw up treaties of peace with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary and Finland, and to propose settlements of territorial questions outstanding on the termination of the war in Europe. Also the Council should prepare a peace settlement for Germany to be accepted when a "government adequate for the purpose is established".

[[Metal rectifier]]

CATEGORIES: Electronic components, Rectifiers

A metal rectifier is an early type of semiconductor rectifier in which the semiconductor is copper oxide or selenium.  They were used to convert alternating current to direct current. They were often used in devices such as radios and battery chargers.   Westinghouse Electric was a major manufacturer of these rectifiers since the late 1920s.

In some countries the term "metal rectifier" is applied to all such devices. In other countries the term "metal rectifier" normally refers to copper-oxide types, and "selenium rectifier" to  selenium-iron types.

[[Mercury-arc rectifier]]

CATEGORIES: Rectifiers, Electronic components

A Mercury-arc rectifier is a type of rectifier used for converting alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC). The cathode is made from a pool of liquid mercury. Mercury-arc rectifiers  were rugged and durable. They could carry higher currents than most other types of rectifier.

The mercury-arc rectifier was invented in 1902 by Peter Cooper Hewitt. They were used to provide power for industrial electric motors, electric railways, trams, and electric locomotives. Other uses included radio transmitters and high-voltage direct current (HVDC) power transmission. They were the primary method of high power rectification before the advent of solid-state electronics in the 1970s. The solid-state rectifier has since replaced the mercury-arc rectifier.

[[Gas turbine]]

CATEGORIES: Motors

A gas turbine, also called a combustion turbine, is a type of internal combustion engine. The simplest form has three main parts:

The diagram shows a single-shaft gas turbine. One turbine drives both the compressor and the load, such as an electric generator.  There are also two-shaft gas turbines, with separate turbines to drive the compressor and the load. Two-shaft turbines are better for driving road and rail vehicles because they can give more torque at low speed.

[[Theorema egregium]]

CATEGORIES: Geometry

Gauss's Theorema Egregium (Latin for "Remarkable Theorem") is a major result of differential geometry proved by Carl Friedrich Gauss. The theorem is about the curvature of surfaces.  The theorem states that  curvature can be determined by measuring angles, distances and their rates on a surface alone. There is no need to talk about the particular manner in which the surface is embedded in the surrounding three-dimensional Euclidean space.  In other words, the Gaussian curvature of a surface does not change if one bends the surface without stretching it.  

Gauss presented the theorem in this manner (translated from Latin):

The theorem is "remarkable" because the starting definition of Gaussian curvature makes direct use of the  position of the surface in space. So it is quite surprising that the result does not depend on its embedding in spite of all bending and twisting deformations undergone.

Unlike a four-stroke engine, there are no intake and exhaust strokes. When the piston is at bottom dead centre, fuel-air mixture is blown in under slight pressure. The incoming mixture forces out the exhaust gas at the same time. The animation shows an engine with crankcase compression to force in the fuel-air mixture. Some engines use a rotary blower instead.

[[Anchorite]]

CATEGORIES: Monks, Christian terminology, Christian religious occupations

An anchorite (female: anchoress) from "one who has retired from the world", is someone who, for religious reasons, withdraws from secular society so as to be able to lead an intensely prayer-filled, ascetic life. Anchorites are often considered to be a type of religious hermit, unlike hermits, anchorites had to make a promise to God to stay in one place, which was a very small room, either attached to, or within the wall of, a local church. 

The anchoritic life is one of the earliest forms of being a Christian monk. From the 12th to the 16th centuries, female anchorites consistently outnumbered their male equivalents, sometimes by as many as four to one (in the 13th century), dropping eventually to two to one (in the 15th century). The sex of a high number of anchorites, however, is not recorded for these periods.

[[Maratha Empire]]

CATEGORIES: History of India

The Maratha Empire or the Maratha Confederacy was a grouping of Indian states that dominated much of the Indian subcontinent in the 17th and 18th centuries. The empire formally existed from 1674 until 1818. The Marathas are given much of the credit for ending Mughal rule in India.

The Marathas were a warrior people from the western Deccan Plateau (present-day Maharashtra) that rose to prominence by establishing "self-rule of Hindu/Indian people" in their region. The Marathas became prominent in the 17th century under the leadership of Shivaji who revolted against the Adil Shahi dynasty and the Mughal Empire and formed a kingdom with Raigad as his capital. Known for their mobility, the Marathas were able to consolidate their territory during the Mughal–Maratha Wars and later controlled a large part of the Indian subcontinent. Their power was eventually ended by the series of wars they fought against the British.

[[Pressurized water reactor]]

CATEGORIES: Nuclear energy

Pressurized water reactors (PWRs) form the large majority of the world's nuclear power plants. In a PWR, the coolant (water) is pumped under high pressure to the reactor core where it is heated by the energy released by the fission of atoms. Pressure in the primary coolant loop prevents the water from boiling within the reactor. The heated water then flows to a steam generator where it transfers heat to a secondary system where steam is generated. The steam flows to a steam turbine which spins an electric generator. The used steam is condensed and returned to the steam generator for re-use. PWRs use ordinary water as both coolant and neutron moderator.

[[The Mpemba effect]]

CATEGORIES: Water, Thermodynamics

The Mpemba effect is that hot water can, under certain circumstances, not only freeze but do so quicker than colder water. This phenomenon has been reported as working as far back as Ancient Greece, even though it would seem contradictory to the laws of thermodynamics. In 1969 a scientist named Erasto B. Mpemba did experiments that proved that the effect is real, however, scientists are left with more questions than answers. Many solutions have been suggested as reasons for this phenomenon, but none have been agreed upon by scientists and most contradictory explanations were obtained by very different experiments with different controls. Perhaps someday after more study scientists will understand this, but currently the results are inconclusive at best.

[[Parson's Cause]]

CATEGORIES: History of Virginia

The "Parson's Cause" was a legal and political dispute in the Colony of Virginia. Many people think it was an  important event leading up to the American Revolution. The case was about the payment of clergy of the Anglican Church in Virginia.  At the time, a lot of tobacco was planted in Virginia. It was one of the commodity crops of the colony.  The colony of Virginia had passed laws in  1748: These laws said that  Virginia's Anglican clergy were to be paid 16,000 pounds of tobacco per year. 

The problem was that the harvest of tobacco was poor in 1758. Because of that, the price of tobacco in Virginia rose from from two to six pennies per pound. This also meant the salary of clergy effectively tripled, that year. The state of Virginia was forced to act, and passed a law called the Two Pennies Act: This law allowed the state authorities to pay the clergy in currency, instead of tobacco. It also fixed the exchange rate of tobacco: it said that for these payments, the state should take a rate of two  pennies per pound of tobacco.  King George III of Great Britain vetoed the law, causing an uproar in the colony.  Many Virginia legislators saw the king's veto as a breach of their legislative authority.

Colonel John Henry, father of Patrick Henry, was the judge who presided over the court case and jury that decided the issue.  Patrick Henry was the person who argued in favor of colonial rights in the case. He was relatively unknown at the time.

The Reverend James Maury had sued in Hanover County Court (April 1, 1762) for back wages on behalf of all the ministers involved: he effectively became a representative of the British cause.  The court ruled (Nov. 5, 1763) that Maury's claim was valid, but that a jury had to determine the amount of damages. This jury was called for in December  1763. Patrick Henry rose to prominence by defending Hanover County against Maury's claims. Henry argued in favor of the Two Penny Act.  As reported by the plaintiff Maury in a letter (Dec. 12, 1763) to fellow Anglican minister John Camm shortly after the trial, Henry argued in substance "that a King, by disallowing Acts of this salutary nature, from being the father of his people, degenerated into a Tyrant and forfeits all right to his subjects' obedience."

The jury awarded Maury one penny in damages. The award essentially nullified the Crown veto, and no other clergy sued.

The Hanover County Courthouse is still operating; historic U.S. Route 301 passes by it. The courthouse is next to the Hanover Tavern, where Patrick Henry lived while arguing the Parson's Cause. It is the third oldest courthouse still in use in the United States.  The state historic office dates the building's construction between 1737 and 1742.

[[Aquatic locomotion]]

CATEGORIES: Anthropology

Aquatic locomotion is animals and other organisms moving through water. The surface of the world is mostly covered with water, and all major animal phyla started life in the water.

The earliest fossils we have are those of stromatolites, which are mat-like structures formed by photosynthetic bacteria in the sea. Even animals which evolved on land have often returned to the water, even though they usually continue to breath air. There are aquatic insects, reptiles, mammals and birds.

We don't quite know when the first animals and plants evolved, but some guesstimates have been made. Acritarchs are present from about 3200 to 1400 million years ago to the present. That's a wide time-range which means we cannot be sure when they evolved. They seem to have been grazed (eaten) by some early forms of life. Probably some kind of protist developed using existing life forms as food.

Locomotion is needed to find the right place in the seas, and to eat and avoid being eaten. All advanced forms of life, and many primitive forms of life, use locomotion.

[[Signal recognition particle]]

CATEGORIES: Cell biology

The signal recognition particle (SRP) is a common molecule found in cytoplasm. It is a ribonucleoprotein (a protein-RNA complex). It recognizes and targets specific proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum of eukaryotes and the plasma membrane of prokaryotes.

When the SRP-ribosome complex binds to a cell membrane receptor, SRP releases the ribosome and drifts away. The ribosome resumes protein synthesis, but now the protein is moving through the SRP-receptor transmembrane pore. So, SRP directs the movement of proteins within the cell. It binds with a transmembrane pore. This allows the protein to cross the membrane to where it is needed. In eukaryotes, the target is the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).

The SRP is 'universally conserved'. That means it is so important that all living things have it in their cells. Despite this, the actual composition of the SRP varies greatly between organisms.

[[Counterintelligence]]

CATEGORIES: Security, Espionage

Counterintelligence is an activity to protect a state against spies and other activities of a foreign intelligence service.

It includes "protecting an agency's intelligence program against an opposition's intelligence service". It refers to information gathered and steps taken to counter espionage. Other intelligence activities are taken to prevent sabotage, or assassinations by foreign powers, organizations or persons. Activities are taken against international terrorist groups and personnel. Work is done on physical, document or communications security programs.

Often counterintelligence at home is done by a different department from gathering intelligence abroad. For example, in the United Kingdom, there is a distinction between the Security Service (MI5) and the Special Branch of the Metropolitan Police. Arrests and interrogation is done by Special Branch. Gathering intelligence abroad is done by MI6, the Secret Intelligence Service.

In theory, the USA has a similar division between foreign activities and homeland activities. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is a domestic security service. The CIA has no law enforcement function and does overseas intelligence gathering, with only limited domestic intelligence collection. In practice, the set-up is much more complex, and ever-changing. For one thing, the career of James Angleton and also the Watergate scandal shows how the CIA has been involved in mainland USA. The addition of the United States Department of Homeland Security was a recognition that the United States was itself a potential target of attack by its various enemies.

Russia may have been the first country to set up an official counterintelligence organisation: the Okhrana was set up in 1880. Its title 'Department for Protecting the Public Security and Order'. sounds very modern. There was an even earlier Russian security department called the 'Department on Protecting the Order and Public Peace'. It was founded in 1866. It would be fair to say that these Russian organisations were not directed towards foreign intelligence services, but against internal threats to public order. They were part of the MVD (Ministry of the Interior).

The Great Stupa at Sanchi is one of the oldest stone structures in India. It is an important monument of Indian Architecture. The emperor Ashoka ordered it to be built,in the 3rd century BCE. Its center was a simple dome-like brick structure built over the relics of the Buddha. It was crowned by the chatra, a parasol-like structure symbolising high rank. This structure was intended  to honour and shelter the relics. The original construction work of this stupa was overseen by Ashoka, whose wife Devi was the daughter of a merchant of nearby Vidisha. Sanchi was her birthplace as well as the place of her wedding with Ashoka. In the 1st century BCE, four elaborately carved toranas (ornamental gateways) and a balustrade encircling the entire structure were added. The Sanchi Stupa built during Mauryan period was made of bricks. The composite flourished until the 11th century.

Sanchi is the center of a region with a number of stupas including Satdhara (17 km from Sanchi, 40 stupas, the Relics of Sariputra and Mahamoggallana, now enshrined in the new Vihara, were unearthed there), Morel Khurd (on a fortified hilltop with 60 stupas), Andher (17 km NE of Vidisha), Mawas, Sonari etc. all within a few miles of Sanchi.

[[Alcubierre drive]]

CATEGORIES: Spacecraft, Propulsion

The Alcubierre drive or Alcubierre warp drive is an idea for a faster-than-light travel engine. The Mexican theoretical physicist Miguel Alcubierre created this idea using Albert Einstein's field equations in general relativity. The main principle of this idea is by creating an energy-density field lower than that of a vacuum (that is, negative mass) to make the space in front of the ship contract and the space behind the ship expand. In theory, this would create a bubble in space-time around the craft, allowing it to stay still while the space around it moves. This would effectively avoid breaking Einstein's rule that no object in our universe may go as fast or faster than the speed of light, while still allowing an object to go to another very distant part of space much faster than light.

CLS (originally Continuous Linked Settlement) is a specialist US financial institution that provides settlement services to its members in the foreign exchange market (FX).  Although the forex market is decentralised and has no central exchange or clearing facility, firms that chose to use CLS to settle their FX transactions can mitigate the settlement risk associated with their trades.

CLS does this through the operation of a payment versus payment (PvP) settlement service which mitigates settlement risk for the FX transactions of its settlement members and their customers (third parties).

The service started operating in 2002 as an Edge Act Corporation, a limited purpose bank regulated by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

Since it began operations in 2002, CLS has rapidly become the market-standard for foreign exchange settlement. As a result, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) officially designated CLS a Systemically Important Financial Market Utility in July 2012.

The single day record for gross-value settlement, set on 19 March 2008, stands at US$10.3 trillion, for 1,113,464 payment instructions. The single day record for gross-volume settlement, set on 28 May 2013, is 1,992,652.

In 2002 CLS was launched with 39 Members and seven currencies.  As of November 2015 CLS settles 18 Currencies, has 74 Shareholders, 64 Settlement Members and over 9,000 active Third Party participants.

[[Whirligig beetle]]

CATEGORIES: Adephaga

The whirligig beetles are a family (Gyrinidae) of water beetles that swim on the surface of fresh water.

They usually swim on the surface of the water if undisturbed, though they go underwater when threatened. They  swim rapidly in circles when alarmed. They have divided eyes which may allow them to see above and below water at the same time. 

The family includes some 700 living species worldwide, in 15 genera, plus a few fossil species. Most species are very similar in appearance, though they vary in size from 3 mm to 18 mm in length. They tend to be flattened and rounded. Their shape is a good approximation to an ellipsoid, with legs and other appendages fitting closely into a streamlined surface.

Both larvae and adults are active predators. The adults carry an air bubble under their elytra, and can submerge for long periods if they want to. Mostly they move around on the surface in groups.

The German fleet consisted of 22 battleships, five battlecruisers, 11 cruisers and 61 torpedo-boats. Scheer also had submarines with torpedos. These he arranged outside the main British bases.

The main British bases were in Scotland: the Orkney and Shetland had a huge base at Scapa Flow, and bases on the mainland were at Cromarty on the Moray Firth and at Rosyth on the north bank of the Firth of Forth.

So, the British fleet steamed south-east from their bases and met the German fleet steaming due north. The battle was fought over a wide area at Jutland Bank west of the Skagerrak between Norway and Denmark.

[[Droughts in the United States]]

CATEGORIES: Droughts, Severe weather

Droughts in the United States is similar to drought around other parts of the world. Below-normal precipitation leads to drought. That's caused by an above average persistence of high pressure over a dry area.

Drought in the United States occurs during climate cycles, such as the North Atlantic oscillation, Atlantic multidecadal oscillation and the El Niño-Southern Oscillation. These determine what areas are more likely to have development of drought and when drought develops.

Droughts are periodic. They alternate with floods over a series of years.

The worst droughts in U.S. history happened in the 1930s and 1950s. The U.S. drought in the 1930s was called the Dust Bowl. The 1936 North American heat wave was part of the Dust Bowl.

Other major droughts in the 20th and 21st centuries happened in the United States in the 1960s, 1980, 1983, 1988-90, 2002 and 2012-14.

The costliest drought in United States history was the 1988-90 drought. The drought caused just over $60 billion in damage. During the drought, there were also heat waves that took the lives of 4,800-17,000 people in the U.S. This drought was also the costliest natural disaster in U.S. history before Hurricane Katrina.

Droughts can affect anywhere within the United States. But the Midwest, Great Plains and Western United States are most likely to be affected by droughts.

Template:Infobox unbiniliumUnbinilium is a hypothetical (theoretical or imagined) element of the periodic table. It is also known as eka- radium. Its atomic number should be 120 and is has the symbol Ubn. The name Unbinilium and the symbol Ubn are temporary IUPAC names (meaning "one-two-zero-ium" in Latin). This name and symbol exists until a permanent name is decided and the element is discovered. It is expected to be a s-block element and an alkaline earth metal. It is the second element in the eighth period of the periodic table.

This element has not been synthesized (obtained or discovered) yet. A German team at the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research attempted a research on 2011. It suggested a possible production of  299Ubn. But it couldn't be done. Attempts were planned by the Russian, Japanese, and French teams. Attempts were made in 2017-2020 and the experiments from the attempts showed that 8th period elements were difficult to synthesize. Unbinilium is expected to be the last element that can be synthesized through current technology.

Unlike the original Woodstock and Woodstock '94, this had several problems that became more famous than the actual event. Firstly, it was very hot in the area, often reaching 100 °F (38 °C) and the area, an old air base, had no trees to keep people cool. Secondly, people were not allowed to bring their own food and drink into the festival, and they had to buy from food sellers in the festival, which was very expensive, costing $12 for a single slice of pizza, and a 590ml bottole of water cost $4. Thirdly, there was a very small amount of toilets for all the people, and within a short time, they were broken.

The festival also had a big violence problem, including the audience tearing plywood from the walls during the performance of the Limp Bizkit song “Break Stuff”. On one occasion, a group handed out candles for a candlelight vigil, but the audience instead used them as a bonfire, throwing water bottles at it to burn longer.

[[Matthew Flinders]]

Matthew Flinders RN (16 March 1774 – 19 July 1814) was an English navigator and cartographer. He was the leader of the first circumnavigation of Australia and identified it as a continent.

Flinders made three voyages to the southern ocean between 1791 and 1810. In the second voyage, George Bass and Flinders confirmed that Van Diemen's Land (now Tasmania) was an island. In the third voyage, Flinders circumnavigated the mainland of what was to be called Australia, along with Aboriginal man Bungaree.

Heading back to England in 1803, Flinders' vessel needed urgent repairs at Isle de France (Mauritius). Although Britain and France were at war, Flinders thought the scientific nature of his work would ensure safe passage, but a suspicious governor kept him under arrest for more than six years. In captivity, he recorded details of his voyages for future publication, and put forward his rationale for naming the new continent 'Australia', as an umbrella term for New Holland and New South Wales – a suggestion taken up later by Governor Macquarie.

Flinders' health had suffered, however, and although he reached home in 1810, he did not live to see the publication of his widely praised book and atlas, A Voyage to Terra Australis.

[[Variscan orogeny]]

CATEGORIES: Orogenies, Palaeozoic

The Variscan orogeny (Hercynian orogeny) is an ancient mountain-building event in the late Palaeozoic era. It was caused by a continental collision between Euramerica (Laurussia) and Gondwana to form the supercontinent of Pangaea.

It explains many older features of the present-day world. The Appalachians in North America and the Massif Central in France are two examples. Other examples are the Pyrenees, Sardinia, the Rhine Massif, the Anti-Atlas in Morocco. To the east, the Variscan caused the Urals, the Pamir, the Tian Shan mountains. 

This geologic mountain-building event took place mostly in the Devonian and Carboniferous periods. By then Pangaea was more or less complete. In the Triassic period of the Mesozoic, there was land between Siberia over the North Pole to Antarctica over the South Pole. Later in the Mesozoic, the opening of the Atlantic split Pangea. The various parts of the huge mountain belts ended up widely apart on the modern globe.

Higher mountain chains on present-day Earth are the product of a later episode of mountain-building known as the Alpine orogeny.
