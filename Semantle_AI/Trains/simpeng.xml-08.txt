Neighbours is an Australian soap opera. The show started in March 1985 on the Seven Network, but they cancelled it the same year. Rival network Network Ten decided to start making and broadcasting the show, and have done that since 1986. It was produced by Reg Watson. The show started with low ratings, and Network Ten did their best to get more people to watch. They got new characters, two of them were played by Kylie Minogue and Jason Donovan. These two characters became a couple known as "Scott and Charlene", and by the time they married in 1987, ratings were much higher.

The show is about the lives of people that live in a fictional street called Ramsay Street. Ramsay Street is in a fictional suburb, Erinsborough, in the real-life city Melbourne.

Sir William McMahon (23 February 1908 – 31 March 1988) was the 20th Prime Minister of Australia. He was elected to the Australian parliament in 1949, and stayed as Member for Lowe, in Sydney, for 33 years. He challenged John Gorton for the leadership of the Liberal Party of Australia in 1971 and won. He was 63 years old. He lost the next election in December 1972 to Gough Whitlam of the Australian Labor Party. This made him the first Prime Minister not to win an election since Labor's Ben Chifley (who lost in 1949). McMahon was married to (Lady) Sonia McMahon from 1965 until his death from cancer. Actor Julian McMahon is their son.

The Liberal party had won lots of elections since 1949, but had some popularity problems by 1971. Australian soldiers were still in the Vietnam War. McMahon replaced John Gorton, then made him defence minister, but soon after made him resign for talking about problems in the Liberal Party. McMahon's government was the first to have a Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. Aboriginal land rights were an important topic of debate at this time. On foreign affairs, McMahon said the Opposition leader, Gough Whitlam, was wrong to visit communist China in 1972 - but soon after U.S. President Richard Nixon visited China and McMahon was embarrassed. The economy was not looking too good when the government went to the 1972 election.

Motorola was a American company that made cell phones and other electronics. The company was based in Schaumburg, Illinois, a small town just outside of Chicago, Illinois. After losing $4.3 billion from 2007 to 2009, Motorola was divided in two separate companies on January 4, 2011; Motorola Mobility and Motorola Solutions.

They were listed in the New York Stock Exchange as MOT https://web.archive.org/web/20130922004147/http://www.nyse.com/about/listed/lcddata.html?ticker.

The company began with the name Galvin Manufacturing Corporation in 1928, and then later adopted the 'Motorola' name in 1947. They were the first developers of the walkie-talkie in World War II.

On August 15, 2011, Google said that it would buy Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion.

On October 30, 2014, Lenovo finalized its purchase of Motorola Mobility from Google.

[[Extrasolar planet]]

CATEGORIES: Exoplanets

An extrasolar planet (or exoplanet) is a natural planet in a planetary system outside our own solar system. 

In 2013, estimates of the number of terrestrial planets in the Milky Way ranged from at least 17 billion to at least 144 billion. The smaller estimate studied planet candidates gathered by the Kepler space observatory. Among them are 461 Earth-size planets, at least four of which are in the "habitable zone" where liquid water can exist. One of the four, dubbed Kepler-69c, is a mere 1.5 times the size of the Earth and around a star like our own Sun – about as near as the current data allow to finding an "Earth 2.0".

Earlier work suggested that there are at least 100 billion planets of all types in our galaxy, an average of at least one per star. There are also planets that orbit brown dwarfs, and free-floating planets that orbit the galaxy directly just as the stars do. It is unclear whether either type should be called a "planet".

Analogies with planets in the Solar System apply to few of the extrasolar planets known. Most are quite unlike any of our planets, for example the so-called "hot Jupiters".

[[Extratropical cyclone]]

CATEGORIES: Tropical cyclones

An extratropical cyclone (also called a mid-latitude cyclone) is a type of cyclone. It is a large low-pressure weather area with clouds, rain and heavy wind. They occur in areas that are between latitudes 30° – 60° from the equator. They are not the same as tropical cyclones or low-pressure weather areas from polar zones. They are actually many masses of cold and warm fronts producing rain, heavy wind, and sometimes tornadoes and even hail.

An extratropical cyclone turns anticlockwise in the Northern Hemisphere. The shape is circular or oval. The usual size in diameter is about 1000 km. These cyclones are usually connected with fronts. A front is a system of changes in weather. It is caused by a very cold air mass meeting a very hot air mass. In the cyclone, there is a system of warm front and cold front. The center of a cyclone is cloudier. There is also a very high chance of precipitation. The wind is strong and changes its direction, as the warm front passes. The weather is stable and fog is usual. As the cold front passes, there is a change of wind, the temperature decreases and rain is also common.

Some extratropical cyclones are made from tropical cyclones that become weak but do not die when they move over cold water. Sometimes, these weather areas can become even stronger than before as they turn into extratropical cyclones. When made from tropical cyclones, they can still have an eye (a place in the middle of a tropical cyclone that is not as windy, cloudy, or rainy). European windstorms are sometimes made when wind from the northwestern part of the Atlantic carry them more east and north towards Europe. Nor'easters often hit northeastern North America, and are made when it is cold, most often in late fall. Wind from the west part of the Atlantic moves them north. They become stronger, and drop snow on the areas it moves into. When a nor'easter drops in pressure and become stronger, by more than one millibar every hour, it is called a weather bomb. Hurricane Hazel was extratropical but still hurricane-level when it hit Toronto, for example.

Cyclonal defects usually occur in series called "the families of the cyclones". Usually, there is a belt of 3 or 4 cyclones in different stages. The cyclone has several stages of evolution. First, there is a stage of the origin of a cyclone. Second stage means that the cyclone is strengthening. At that moment, both the warm and cold front are very large. The system is moving very fast.  The cold front is generally faster, which means that it runs down the warm one. This causes an occluded front. The weather is similar to both types of fronts. The third stage ends with filling of the area with air. The pressure rises. Stage four means that the signs of cyclonal weather disappear.

[[Small solar system body]]

CATEGORIES: Minor planets, Solar System

A small solar system body (SSSB) is a term defined in 2006 by the International Astronomical Union to describe solar system objects which are not planets or dwarf planets:

Therefore, it refers to these objects that can be further grouped based on their orbit or what they are made of:

Some of the larger "small solar system bodies" may be reclassified in future as dwarf planets, pending further examination to determine whether or not they are in hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly-round shape).

[[Frankenstein]]

CATEGORIES: 1818 books, English novels, Horror novels, English-language novels, Science fiction books

Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus is a novel written by Mary Shelley. It is about a creature produced by a strange scientific experiment. Shelley started writing the story when she was nineteen. It was published when she was twenty-one. The first edition was published anonymously in London in 1818. Shelley's name appears on the second edition, published in France in 1823.

Shelley had travelled in the region of Geneva, Switzerland, where much of the story takes place. Ideas about occultism were topics of conversation among her travelling companions, especially her future husband, Percy Bysshe Shelley. Mary, Percy, Lord Byron, and his doctor John Polidori decided to have a competition to see who could write the best horror story. After thinking for weeks about what her possible storyline could be, Shelley dreamt about a scientist who created life and was horrified by the result. She then wrote Frankenstein.

Since publication of the novel, the name "Frankenstein" is often used to refer to the monster itself. This usage is sometimes considered erroneous, but usage commentators regard the monster sense of "Frankenstein" as well-established and an acceptable usage. In the novel, the monster however is called "creature", "monster", "fiend", "wretch", "vile insect", "daemon", "being", and "it". Speaking to Victor Frankenstein, the monster refers to himself as "the Adam of your labors", and elsewhere as someone who "would have" been "your Adam", but is instead "your fallen angel."

[[Advance Australia Fair]]

CATEGORIES: National anthems, Australia

Advance Australia Fair is the official national anthem of Australia. 

Peter Dodds McCormick (1834–1916) wrote the music and the words for the song. It was first performed in 1878, but it only became Australia's official anthem in 1984.

Between 1878 and 1984, the song was used inside of Australia as a patriotic song. For a time the song announced the news from the Australian Broadcasting Commission. When Australia became a Federation in 1901, the song was sung by a choir of 10,000 people.

In 1977 there was a vote for the national anthem between four songs during the 1977 Australian referendum. The other three songs were:

Advance Australia Fair received 43.29% of the vote, defeating the three alternatives: Waltzing Matilda (28.28%), Song of Australia (9.65%), and the existing national anthem God Save the Queen (18.78%). However, it was not until 1984 that the national anthem was changed to reflect the popular vote.

Other songs and marches have been influenced by Advance Australia Fair, such as the Australian Vice-Regal salute.

CATEGORIES: 1896, 19th century in Greece, Sport in Athens, Summer Olympics in Europe, 1890s in Europe

The 1896 Summer Olympics, officially known as the Games of the I Olympiad, were held at Athens in Greece.

The  games took place from April 6 to 15, 1896. It was the first international Olympic Games held in the Modern era. As Ancient Greece was the birthplace of the Olympic Games, Athens was an appropriate choice to stage the inaugural modern Games. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) was also instituted during this congress.

The 1896 Olympics were regarded as a great success even though there were many obstacles and setbacks. The Games had the largest international participation of any sporting event to that date. The Panathinaiko Stadium, the only Olympic stadium used in the 19th Century, overflowed with the largest crowd ever to watch a sporting event. The highlight for the Greeks was the marathon victory by Spyridon Louis. The most successful competitor was German wrestler and gymnast Carl Schuhmann, who won four events.

After the Games, Rhys Coubertin and the IOC were petitioned by several prominent figures including Greece's King George and some of the American competitors in Athens, to hold all the following Games in Athens. However, the 1900 Summer Olympics were already planned for Paris and, except for the Intercalated Games of 1906, the Olympics did not return to Greece until the 2004 Summer Olympics, some 108 years later.

The stories about the events and people of these Games were in the 1984 NBC miniseries, The First Olympics: Athens, 1896 – starring David Ogden Stiers as William Milligan Sloane and Louis Jourdan as Pierre de Coubertin.

[[Makalani]]

CATEGORIES: Arecaceae, Trees

Makalani is the name given to a certain palm tree, growing in northern Namibia (Southern Africa). The local Owambo people call a full grown palm tree "Omulunga" and a sapling "Oshivale." These palm trees grow very high and it takes many years for a Makalani sapling to grow into a full-grown tree.

The seeds look like small coconuts, and the local people, the Owambos and Himbas, peel the outer ginger looking skin and carve the inner hard core to certain objects of art. The inner core is white with a dark brown skin, the size of a golf ball, and it is hollow inside. The Makalani fruit (Ondunga/Onduga)is very useful to the local people. It can be eaten and can also be used to brew Ombike/Owalende: the Oshiwambo brew that looks and taste similar to Whiskey.  

There are now also some hotels, restaurants, and guesthouses which have adopted the name Makalani (in Namibia). These include Makalani Sugar processors, Makalani Holdings and Makalani Airtime Distributors.

Trowbridge is the county town of Wiltshire, a county in England. It is on the River Biss in the west of the county, 8 miles (13 km) south east of Bath, Somerset, separated by the Mendip Hills, which rise 3 miles (4.8 km) to the west. The town is also 38 miles (61 km) south of Gloucester and 20 miles (32km) south east of Bristol.

Trowbridge has been a market town for a long time. The Kennet and Avon Canal has been a very important part of the town's growth because it allowed coal to be moved from the Somerset Coalfield. This began steam-powered wool production in mills, which the town is famous for. The town was a very important producer of clothes and blankets in the south west of England. Because of this, in the late 18th century and early 19th century, it had the nickname of "The Manchester of the West".

The civil parish of Trowbridge had 33,108 people in the 2011 census. The parish goes over the areas of Longfield, Lower Studley, Upper Studley, Studley Green and Trowle Common. Parishes that are next to Trowbridge include Staverton, Hilperton, West Ashton, North Bradley, Southwick and Wingfield. Some towns close to Trowbridge are Bradford on Avon, Westbury, Melksham, Frome and Devizes.

In music, a bow is a stick which is strung with hair.  It is used to pull across the strings of a string instrument such as a violin, viola, cello or double bass.  

[[Bowing]]

CATEGORIES: Non-verbal communication

Bowing means: taking a bow.  A bow is when a person bends their body forward from the waist in order to greet someone or show respect for them.  A bow is sometimes not much more than a quick nod of the head, but it can be a very deep bow from the waist. The exact way to bow and the situations in which people bow vary enormously between different cultures.  

Bowing was originally a gesture (a movement of the body) which showed deep respect for someone.  In European cultures bowing to someone is now only done in very formal situations, e.g. when meeting the Queen or someone very high and important.

In European history bowing was common at royal courts.  Men were expected to "bow and scrape".  This meant bowing and at the same time drawing back the right leg so that it scraped the floor. The man would hold his left hand over his waist while doing this. This is why we still talk about  "bowing and scraping" meaning that someone is trying very hard and hypocritically to be unnecessarily polite.  This kind of deep bow, which is never used nowadays, is sometimes called a “reverence” (a word meaning: “deep respect”).

Bowing was only done by men.  Women would always curtsey to show respect.

Nowadays bowing in European cultures is mostly seen at performances.  When people applaud (clap their hands) after a performance such as a concert on in the theatre the performer will take a bow.  This is like saying “thank you” to the audience for saying “thank you” by clapping. Both men and women performers bow (although female ballet dancers will curtsey).

In Christian worship people in churches will bow to the altar to show respect to Jesus.

There are other special occasions in which people bow.  In judo and some other martial arts the two contestants (people who are going to fight) will bow to one another to show that they respect one another and will obey the rules of the game.

In some Asian cultures bowing is far more common than in the West.  It is especially important in Japan.  Japanese people – both men and women - spend a lot of their time bowing.  They bow to greet one another, to say goodbye, to say they are sorry, to say ‘thank you’, or to show that they are not as important as the person they are bowing to.  There are different degrees of bowing, and it is very important in Japanese culture to know the right way to bow on different occasions.  A bow of 15 degrees is very informal, a bow of 45 degrees is very formal.  They keep their back (from the head to the hips) straight while doing this.  The men have their hands by their sides, women have one hand over the other in front of their body.  Typically a bow should last a count of eight: three to go down, one for a pause and four for returning to an upright position. If someone bows a little longer than the other person, that other person may bow again, and the other person then also bows again, and this can go on several times.   Japanese mothers carry their babies on their backs, so that children learn to bow even before they can speak.  Pupils and teachers at school bow to one another.  The more important someone is, the deeper the other person has to bow.

Billie Jean King (born Billie Jean Moffitt on November 22, 1943 in Long Beach, California) is an American retired tennis player. She is considered one of the greatest female tennis players. She won many championships during her career, which started in 1959 and ended in 1983. She was known for speaking against sexism in sports and society. She started the Women's Tennis Association, World TeamTennis, and the Women's Sports Foundation. Her most famous match was in 1973. It was called "The Battle of the Sexes" and was with Bobby Riggs, who had been a champion in the 1930s and 1940s. She loved playing tennis but had to stop after an injury.

Her brother is baseball player Randy Moffitt.

Billie Jean King grew up poor. It was hard for her parents to support her. Her father was an engineer for a fire department. Her mother was a housekeeper. Her father had two jobs. Her mother sold Tupperware to pay for King’s tennis competitions. King’s family could not pay to join their local tennis club. Therefore, King learned at public tennis courts. 

King was interested in fighting for the rights of women in tennis. When she was seventeen years old, King played doubles in Wimbledon. She and her partner, Karen Hantze, won the match. They became the youngest women players to win that match at Wimbledon. Even though she won this competition, she didn't want to focus on tennis completely yet. 

King joined a community college and married Larry King. Later, she played tennis again and spoke against sexism. She is famous for winning a competition called the Battle of the Sexes against Bobby Riggs in 1973. This was one of the first tennis matches when a man played against a woman. Winning this match really helped her speak about sexism. She used tennis and the Battle of the Sexes to prove that women are as good at sports as men. She was important in tennis and helped the voice of women.

[[Ethnic cleansing]]

CATEGORIES: Crimes against humanity

Ethnic cleansing is where ethnic or religious groups are forced to leave an area by another ethnic group.  The goal of an ethnic cleansing is to remove one ethnic group from a certain geographical area. 

In an ethnic cleansing, They may force people to move; deport people; threaten them until they leave;  and use rape and mass murder.

Ethnic genocide is a form of ethnic cleansing but not all cases of ethnic cleansing are ethnic genocide 

[[Timbre]]

CATEGORIES: Musical terminology

Timbre is a quality of sound. It is what makes two different musical instruments sound different from each other, even when each instrument plays the same musical note.

"Playing the same note" means they have the same pitch and loudness. For instance, timbre is the difference between a guitar and a piano playing the same note at the same volume. In music, tone quality and color are synonyms for timbre.

There are many attempts by music theorists to explain timbre more fully. Unfortunately, their ideas depend on the reader having an advanced knowledge of musical theory. The Acoustical Society of America (ASA) Acoustical Terminology definition 12.09 of timbre is "that attribute of auditory sensation which enables a listener to judge that two nonidentical sounds, similarly presented and having the same loudness and pitch, are dissimilar". It adds "Timbre depends primarily upon the frequency spectrum, although it also depends upon the sound pressure and the temporal characteristics of the sound". 

[[Exaggeration]]

CATEGORIES: Figures of speech

Exaggeration  is a term for a figure of speech.  It means the describing of something and making it more than it really is.  The verb is to exaggerate.

An example of exaggeration would be: “I was walking along when suddenly this enormous dog walked along.  It was as big as an elephant”.  The dog may have been big, but it was certainly not as big as that. Another example of exaggeration would be: “I caught a fish as big as my house.”

Overstatement is another word that means almost the same thing.  The opposite of overstatement is understatement. 

A  hyperbole (IPA:haı'pɝ.bə.li) is a type of exaggeration that is used in literature.  It is a figure of speech.  The opposite of hyperbole is hypobole, which is an understatement.

People exaggerate things because they have strong feelings about something.  People may exaggerate to make people listen to what they say.  They may do it to emphasize something.  They may also exaggerate just to sound funny:

People may understate because they are being modest:

In modern slang, the word “hype” is sometimes used about something that is getting more publicity than it really deserves.  The word hype comes from the word “hyperbole”.

[[Meiosis]]

CATEGORIES: Chromosomes

Meiosis is a special type of cell division. Unlike mitosis, the way normal body cells divide, meiosis results in cells that only have half the usual number of chromosomes, one from each pair. For that reason, meiosis is often called reduction division. In the long run, meiosis increases genetic variation, in a way which will be explained later.

Sexual reproduction takes place when a sperm fertilizes an egg. The eggs and sperm are special cells called gametes, or sex cells. Gametes are haploid; they have only half the number of chromosomes as a normal body cell (called a somatic cell). Fertilization restores the chromosomes in body cells to the diploid number.

The basic number of chromosomes in the body cells of a species is called the somatic number and is labelled 2n. In humans 2n = 46: we have 46 chromosomes. In the sex cells the chromosome number is n (humans: n = 23). So, in normal diploid organisms, chromosomes are present in two copies, one from each parent (23x2=46). The only exception are the sex chromosomes. In mammals, the female has two X chromosomes, and the male one X and one Y chromosome.

A karyotype is the characteristic chromosome number of a eukaryote species. The preparation and study of karyotypes is part of cytogenetics, the genetics of cells.

All eukaryotes that reproduce sexually use meiosis. This also includes many single-celled organisms. Meiosis does not occur in archaea or bacteria, which reproduce by asexual processes such as binary fission.

[[Gainsharing]]

CATEGORIES: Economics

Gainsharing is a system of management used by a business to increase profitability by motivating employees to improve their performance through involvement and participation.  As their performance improves, employees share financially in the gain (improvement). Gainsharing’s goal is to improve performance and eliminate waste (time, energy, and materials) by motivating employees to work smarter as a team rather than just working harder.

Gainsharing should not be confused with profit sharing. There are many differences between  Gainsharing and profit sharing. Gainsharing is also called Gain sharing, Gainshare, and  Gain share. It could also be called "savings sharing."  In other words, a company shares with employees the savings from improved performance.

There are two important parts of a Gainsharing system. One is a bonus calculation. The second is a structured system for employee involvement. Because of these two parts, Gainsharing is best seen as an "organizational development" tool. It is not just a bonus or "incentive plan."  In order to get a better understanding of this concept one needs to look back at Gainsharing's history.

[[Book of Mormon]]

CATEGORIES: Mormonism, Religious texts, 1830s books

The Book of Mormon is a book that Latter Day Saints believe is the word of God along with the Bible.

The original English version of the Book of Mormon was published in March 1830 by a man named Joseph Smith, Jr. who claimed to be a prophet like the ones in the Old Testament.

Joseph Smith said that he translated the book into English from gold plates given to him by an angel. The book claims that the language it was first written in was made from "the learning of the Jews and the language of the Egyptians."

The story contained in the Book of Mormon is a shortened version written by a man named Mormon of the record of two groups of people called the Nephites and the Lamanites. Their ancestors left Jerusalem with their father Lehi about 600 years before the birth of Christ, sailed across a very big ocean, and settled in the New World. It gives an account of their families, cities, wars, systems of government, spiritual experiences and religious beliefs among other things. The main purpose of the Book of Mormon is to teach about Jesus Christ.

It also contains the Book of Ether (a very old book discovered by the Nephites) which told the story of another people (called the Jaredites) who had lived in some of the same areas shortly after the time of the Tower of Babel, but died out because of wars.

Usually, Book of Mormon stories show the Nephites as the more righteous, industrious and peaceful people and the Lamanites as wicked, lazy and warlike. Wars happen all the time between the two groups. But, near the end of the book, the Nephites become more wicked than the Lamanites, and all the Nephites die in their last war, except for one named Moroni who was directed by God to bury the Book of Mormon in a hill so that Joseph Smith Jr. could find it.

The central theme of the book revolves around Jesus Christ visiting the people described, performing miracles and showing them the right way to live.

[[Monte Carlo algorithm]]

CATEGORIES: Randomised algorithms

It is a computation process that uses random numbers to produce an outcome(s). Instead of having fixed inputs, probability distributions are assigned to some or all of the inputs. This will generate a probability distribution for the output after the simulation is run.

For example, a Monte Carlo algorithm can be used to estimate the value of π. The amount of area within a quarter-circle of radius 1 depends on the value of π. The probability that a randomly-chosen point will lie in that quarter-circle depends on the area of the circle. If points are placed randomly in a square with sides of length 1, the percentage of points that fall within a quarter-circle of radius 1 will depend on the value of π. A Monte Carlo algorithm would randomly place points in the square and use the percentage of points falling inside of the circle to estimate the value of π.This is an effective way for making approximations.

In modern communication systems, the quality of information exchange is determined by the presence of noise in the channel. The major source of noise - Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) being random in nature can be characterized using the Monte Carlo algorithm in simulating a Communications System

The modern version of the Markov chain Monte Carlo method was invented in the late 1940s by Stanislaw Ulam, while he was working on nuclear weapons projects at the Los Alamos National Laboratory.

Jews typically consider themselves as a people and not only as adherents of a religion, therefore a Jew is not only one that practices the religion of Judaism, but it is also one who is of Jewish ethnic heritage. Jews originated as an ethnoreligious group in the Middle East. According to traditional Jewish law, called Halakha, someone is Jewish if their mother was a Jew or if they have converted to Judaism.  Judaism has been described as a religion, a race, an ethnic group, a culture, a nation, and an extended family.

Israel is the only modern country with a Jewish majority, but there are Jewish minorities in many places in the world. Most of them live in large cities in the United States, Argentina, Europe and Australia.  Both Israel and the U.S. have over five million Jews. In the Soviet Union there were more than two million Jews, but many of them moved to Israel, the U.S. and other Western countries since the collapse of the Soviet Union.

Jews have been victims of various persecutions. The most well known happened during the Second World War, when almost six million Jews were killed by the Nazis. It is known as the Holocaust.

Petunia is a genus of plants. All of them bear flowers. They are in the Nightshade family, and are related to tobacco. Many people grow them in the garden. Petunias are usually used as annual plants, because they die when the weather becomes cold. They grow best when they are planted in the sun.

Garden petunia is not difficult to grow or maintain and presents no particular challenges provided the soil is kept reasonably dry. Garden petunia is used for its delicate, colorful flower booms, pleasing scent and its flowering duration which lasts from spring until frost. They make excellent bedding and container plants.

If growing garden petunia in containers or baskets, opt for a time-release fertilizer.The most important factor in growing of garden petunia is sunlight. garden petunia needs at least five hours of sunlight per day. Lack of sunlight may also lead to leggy plants and a lack of healthy flowering.

As a solid, the alkali is deliquescent and readily absorbs moisture and carbon dioxide from the air. It dissolves easily in water, and makes the water warm when this happens. Sodium hydroxide is used as a solution called lye to make soap.  Lye is also used to unclog drains.  Its dissolving properties and its ability to easily break surface tension are fundamental for its uses. It works in two ways. First, it combines with grease to make soap. Second, it dissolves hair (which is soluble in any basic solution).

[[Decidability theory]]

CATEGORIES: Theoretical computer science

Decidability theory is a branch of mathematics. Suppose there is a set, and there is an element. There is also an algorithm. The algorithm will simply check if the element belongs to the set or not. If the algorithm stops (after a limited time) and has reached a decision, if the element is in the set or not, this is called decidable.

In simple terms, if there is a shopping bag, decidability is that one is able to check whether or not there is some salad in the bag.

Some logical problems cannot be decided that way (This statement is false). They are called undecidable

There is a weaker property too, called semidecidable. A set is called semidecidable (or recursively enumerable), if the  algorithm described above can only decide if an element is in the set or is not in the set in finite time, but not both.

[[Construction worker]]

CATEGORIES: Construction occupations

A construction worker is someone whose job is to work on a construction site where structures such as bridges or houses are being built. Construction workers use many types of tools (such as shovels and wrenches) and operate machines and vehicles such as trucks and bulldozers. Working as a construction worker can be dangerous, because a person could fall, or have a heavy object fall on them. Construction workers have to wear safety clothing to protect themselves, such as leather work boots with a metal toe, plastic construction hats or helmets, and goggles to protect their eyes. Many construction workers also wear brightly-coloured orange safety vests, so that drivers and other construction workers will be able to see them.

According to the Prose Edda, Odin took Loki's three children by Angrboða (the wolf Fenrir, Hel, and Jörmungandr) and tossed Jörmungandr into the great ocean that encircles Midgard. The serpent grew so large that it was able to surround the Earth and grasp its own tail, receiving the name of the Midgard Serpent as a result.

[[Cosplay]]

CATEGORIES: Anime, Anime and manga terms

Cosplay is a short way of saying of "Costume Play". It is an act of dressing up to look like an anime, manga, video game, Japanese rock,  or K-pop character. A person who does this is called a Cosplayer.

Cosplay can be divided into two parts, basic cosplay and masquerade cosplay. Both types of cosplay involve trying to physically look like the character, including speaking like the character and memorizing quotes. Masquerading, or "The Masquerade," usually refers to a cosplay competition where cosplayers demonstrate their skills in creating costumes, putting on skits, and in technical matters.

Even though cosplaying is originally from Japan, there are a number of cosplay communities in Malaysia, China, the United States, UK, Indonesia, and the Philippines, because of the popularity of Japanese animation, movies, and popular culture in those countries.

Cosplay communities often hold events such as parties and conventions. Some of the best cosplayers can be famous amongst otaku.

[[Las Vegas algorithm]]

CATEGORIES: Randomised algorithms, Game theory

A Las Vegas algorithm is an algorithm that uses randomness which has the consequence that the algorithm terminates with probability $p<1$. If the algorithm does terminate then it does so with a correct result (unlike a Monte Carlo algorithm which definitely terminates but with a result that is only correct with probability $p<1$). The algorithm  gambles with the resources used. It may take a very long times to give back a result, or it may not give back a result at all.

A simple example would be a version of the Quicksort. Quicksort is used to quickly sort things (mostly numbers). For this, each element is compared to a central element (called pivot). Depending on how this element is selected the sorting can take more time or less.

Most often, a Las Vegas algorithm is used to pick the pivot randomly.

[[Factorial]]

CATEGORIES: Recursion, Mathematics

The factorial of a whole number n, written as n! or n, is found by multiplying n by all the whole numbers less than it. For example, the factorial of 4 is 24, because 4 × 3 × 2 × 1. Hence one can write 4!. For some technical reasons, 0! is equal to 1.

Factorial can be used to find out how many possible ways there are to arrange n objects.

For example, if there are 3 letters (A, B, and C), they can be arranged as ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, and CBA. That would be 6 choices because A can be put in 3 different places, B has 2 choices left after A is placed, and C has only one choice left after A and B have been placed. In other words, 3 × 2 × 1 choices.

The factorial function is a good example of recursion (doing things over and over), as 3! can be written as 3×(2!), which can be written as 3×2×(1!) and finally as 3×2×1×(0!). N! can therefore also be defined as N×(N-1)!, with 0! = 1.

The factorial function grows very fast. There are 10! = 3,628,800 ways to arrange 10 items.

[[Database]]

CATEGORIES: Databases

A database is a system for storing and taking care of data (any kind of information).

A database engine can sort, change or serve the information on the database. The information itself can be stored in many different ways; before digital computers, card files, printed books and other methods were used. Now most data is kept on computer files.

A database system is a computer program for managing electronic databases. A very simple example of a database system would be an electronic address book. 

The data in a database is organized in some way. Before there were computers, employee data was often kept in filing cabinets. There was usually one card for each employee. On the card, information such as the date of birth or the name of the employee could be found. A database also has such "cards". To the user, the card will look the same as it did in old times, only this time it will be on the screen. To the computer, the information on the card can be stored in different ways. Each of these ways is known as a database model. The most commonly used database model is called the relational database model. It uses relations and sets to store the data. Normal users talking about the database model will not talk about relations; instead, they will talk about database tables.

[[Jörð]]

CATEGORIES: Norse gods and goddesses

Jörð (or Jord) is a giantess (jötun) and goddess in Norse mythology. Her name means "earth". She is also called Fjörgyn.

Jörð is the wife of Odin, king of the gods, and the mother of Thor. Her parents are Annar and Nótt.

Snorri Sturluson says Jörð was included among the Asynjur.  Her name occurs most often in Skaldic and Eddic poetry in phrases that refer to Thor as "the son of Jörð".  There is some confusion, however, because in some parts of the Poetic Edda the word "Fjörgyn" appears in phrases referring to Thor, such as in the poem "Voluspa", where Thor is described as "the son of Fjörgyn".  Scholars explain the confusion by pointing out that Fjörgyn, as an Old Norse noun, means "earth" when used in the feminine form.

[[Asgard]]

CATEGORIES: Norse mythology

Asgard (Old Norse: Ásgarðr - “Enclosure of the Æsir; Court of the Ás”) is one of the Nine Realms in Norse mythology, home to the tribe of deities known as the Æsir. Asgard lies at the top of Yggdrasill’s highest branches, and the only thing connecting Asgard to Midgard is the mystical rainbow bridge Bifröst. 

At the center of Asgard lies the bountiful field of Iðavöllr; there the Æsir meet to feast, make revelry, and discuss important issues. The male gods meet in a hall called Glaðsheimr, the goddesses in the hall Vingólf. *According to the poem Grímnismál (as found in the Poetic Edda), Glaðsheimr is the field in which Valhalla was located.

Alien is a 1979 British-American science fiction–horror movie directed by Ridley Scott. It is called a science fiction movie because the story takes place in outer space, and there are alien creatures.  The movie's title refers to a highly aggressive (angry) and intelligent extraterrestrial (alien creature) that attacks and hurts the crew of the spaceship Nostromo. The movie stars Sigourney Weaver as Ellen Ripley, Tom Skerritt as Captain Dallas, and Ian Holm as Ash.

The extraterrestrials in the movies are usually called Xenomorphs.

Alien was a box office success (it made a lot of money). It led to a successful Hollywood franchise of books, video games, merchandise, and three official sequels (follow-ups). Along with launching the career of actress Sigourney Weaver, the movie is credited as being the first action movie to have a strong female heroine.

There are three sequels to this movie: Aliens (1986), Alien³ (1992), Alien: Resurrection (1997), and a cross-overs: Alien vs. Predator (2004) and Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem (2007).

The famous tagline (slogan) for the movie was: In space no one can hear you scream.

[[Isabella of Castile]]

Isabella of Castile (22 April 1451 – 26 November 1504) was a queen of Castile and León. She was the daughter of John II of Castile and his second wife Isabel of Portugal. 

Her brother, Enrique IV, who was the king of Castile, wanted her to marry her off. She wanted to marry someone from Portugal to make a political ally. She secretly married Ferdinand II of Aragon in 1469, and had five children with him.  The youngest was Catherine of Aragon, who married Henry VIII of England in 1509. Isabella was the grandmother of Carlos I of Spain (Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor).  

When Isabella’s brother died, she was supposed to be the new queen. Her brother Enriques’s daughter, Juana, wanted to become queen instead. After a war, Isabella became queen. At the same time, Isabella’s husband, Ferdinand, became king of Aragon. They united the lands of Castile and Aragon into present-day Spain. Isabella helped pay for four of Christopher Columbus’ trips to find the Americas. In their time, the Americas were called “The New World”. She signed a truce in 1492 that made Spain a Christian country. After she died, her daughter Joanna of Castile became queen.

Hector Berlioz (born La Côte-St-André, Isère, 11 December 1803; died Paris, 8 March 1869) was a French composer. He was one of the greatest composers of the 19th century. His music is typical of the Romantic period: full of passion and often based on ideas outside music. He was not particularly good at playing any instrument, but he was brilliant at writing for the orchestra. Some of his most famous works include several orchestral overtures, the Symphonie Fantastique, the opera Les Troyens (The Trojans), the requiem Grande messe des morts and the song cycle Les nuits d'été (Summer Nights). He was very original as a composer, and his music was not fully appreciated until many years after his death.

Vincenzo Bellini (Catania, November 3 1801 - Puteaux, near Paris, September 23 1835) was an Italian composer and opera composer.

Bellini was well liked for his melodies. His first success was Il pirata in 1827. It was followed by I Capuleti e Montecchi in 1830. Then came his most famous operas La sonnambula (1831), Norma (1831) and his last I puritani (1835).

His second to last work Beatrice di Tenda (1833) was less successful.

Although his operas never left the repertoire, they became popular again in the 1950s due largely to soprano Maria Callas, followed by Joan Sutherland in the 1960s.

Charles-Valentin Alkan (30 November 1813 - 29 March 1888) was a French-Jewish composer and pianist. His real name was Morhange. He was a virtuoso pianist who wrote a lot of piano music. Most of the pieces he wrote are extremely difficult to play. Franz Liszt,  Busoni and other people of his day thought he was a great composer. Despite this, most people have only discovered in recent years how good his music is. His piano music is mostly tonal, but it changes key in unusual ways. The story was told by many people that he died when a bookcase collapsed on top of him, but that story is proved not to be true.

From the 1860s to 1873 he did not show in public very much, and composed some of his works.

Alkan was a close friend of Frédéric Chopin and Franz Liszt.

In this stage of time, people are very bad. To make the world good, Kalki will come to Earth, and will destroy the bad things and kill the bad people. People will change then, and become good people. A new stage of time will begin, called the Satya Yuga or the first stage of life. He is deciding to only come when everybody on Earth is very cruel. Kalki will come after Buddha, his work is to punish people who not changed their behaviour even after Buddha taught the right way. Kalki will come within this millennium. He will take birth in India. According to Nostradamus prophecies Kalki is the Chyren who will be king of whole world.He establish rightness in earth after defeating the whole world. He will punish bad people without mercy. It is said that he will be ruthless to cruel people. Kalki will establish a Golden Age within the Kali Yuga, before becoming king of the world. It is said that Krishna told Arjuna on the battlefield that right after his death, there will be the beginning of the Kali Yuga. He says 5000 years after his death (6000 B.C.) will come a Golden Age within the Kali Yuga. After the Kali Yuga Golden Age which will last approximately 10,000 years, he will establish the real Satya Yuga by defeating Kali (Demon) who is also known as the prince of evil in vedic scriptures.

Mozart thought he was so talented that he taught him free of charge.  Hummel became one of the greatest pianists and composers in Europe.  He always wrote in a Classical style, he never became an early Romantic like Beethoven.

He also wrote a concerto for trumpet, which is fairly famous.

[[Alphabetical order]]

CATEGORIES: Alphabet

Alphabetical order is a way to sort (organize) a list. It helps a reader to find a name or a title in the list. It is done by following the standard (usual) order of letters in an alphabet. Some lists in alphabetical order were used during the early Roman Empire. It became commonplace after the Renaissance. 

Sorting things in English is done using the Roman alphabet. Different languages have different rules for sorting.

She filmed a North American tour of the band. In 2002, she published a book of art inspired by the Tamil rebellion and her childhood in Sri Lanka. She met the musician Peaches who introduced M.I.A. to the Roland MC 505. M.I.A. wrote and recorded several songs on a demo using a 505, including the song "Galang."

"Galang" was initially released in 2003 on the white-label Showbiz Recordings. It became popular with DJs and garnered acclaim.

M.I.A. signed to XL Recordings in 2004. The song "Sunshowers" and "Galang" were re-released. Through 2004, file-sharing of the two singles and leaked promos of Arular on the internet increased anticipation for her debut album Arular.

One of the first artists to break on the internet, M.I.A. ended 2004 making Piracy Funds Terrorism, a mash-up mixtape of Arular tracks produced by herself and DJ Diplo.

[[Key (music)]]

CATEGORIES: Musical keys

Most music is in a particular key.  This means that one of the 12 notes (C, D flat, D, etc.) sounds like the “home note”.  When the piece finishes it normally comes to rest on this home note (also called: the “tonic”).  The piece will be built on the notes of the scale that starts on that note. There are two kinds of key (like there are two kinds of scale): major and minor.  Sometimes the key of a piece is in its title: "Minuet in C", "Sonata in F sharp major".  If the title does not say “major” or “minor” it is normally taken to be major.

[[Otaku]]

CATEGORIES: Slang, Anime and manga terms

Otaku is a Japanese slang word, deriving from the honorific "おたく" (otaku), meaning "your house", that has come to mean someone who obsessively exerts time, money, and energy into a hobby. Otaku have a deep, complex knowledge around a particular subject or area of study, and is oftentimes (esp. in the West) used to refer to avid consumers of anime and manga. The term can be compared with Hikikomori.

In Japan, otaku has generally regarded as an offensive word, due to the negative cultural perception of withdrawal from society. However, the otaku philosophy of living has gained traction among Japanese youth and adolescents, likely as a reaction to the established culture of intense work and academic studies. Under 30’s have developed a neo-otaku identity with more positive associations of being a geek or nerd. In the West, the word usually describes an anime or manga "fanatic" and is not typically perceived as derogatory.

Kristallnacht (also called Reichskristallnacht, Reichspogromnacht, Night of the Broken Glass) was a two-day pogrom that happened against Jews in Nazi Germany and parts of Austria. It was between 9 and 10 November 1938. About 30,000 Jews were moved to concentration camps, and over 1,500 synagogues were pillaged and partly destroyed. Also, almost all Jewish cemeteries in Germany and Austria were destroyed. This marked the change from discriminating against Jews to actively persecuting and deporting them.

Herschel Grynszpan (sometimes also spelled Grünspan), a 17-year-old Jew living in Paris, learned that his whole family had been made to go back to Zsbaszyn in Poland, even though the younger children had been born in Germany. He got a gun, and with this he fired shots at Ernst Eduard vom Rath, who was a secretary of the German embassy in Paris. This was on 7 November. Vom Rath died of his wounds on 9 November.

The motive of Grynszpan is unclear. In a judicial hearing in 1942, he said it was revenge. He meant to shoot the ambassador, but hit the secretary instead.

The NSDAP used this event as an excuse to seize Jewish property. There had been a similar event in February 1936 but there were almost no consequences. Then, a Jewish student, David Frankfurter, had fired shots at the NSDAP secretary Wilhelm Gustloff. At that time, the NSDAP could not act because of the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin.

[[Pogrom]]

CATEGORIES: Riots

Pogrom (from Russian:погром (pogrom); from "громить" IPA: grʌˈmitʲ- to wreak havoc, to demolish violently) is a form of riot attacking people and property. The target of the attack is a group of people because of their ethnic identity or religion, usually Jews. In a pogrom, the local authorities such as the police do not arrest the rioters and do not come to the aid of the victims.

In a pogrom, the target people's homes, businesses, and places of worship are destroyed. People of the target group are physically attacked and some are murdered.

A Soxhlet extractor is a kind of laboratory equipment. It is made of glass. Franz von Soxhlet invented it in 1879.  It has a flask, an extraction chamber, and a condenser. It can be used for solid-liquid extractions. 

In this discontinuous extraction process, the extraction solvent inside the boiling flask is evaporated and re-condensed in the distillation column above. It then falls down onto the solid material requiring extraction. The chamber containing the solid material is connected to the boiling flask below by a syphoning mechanism seen in the Pythagorean cup, which allows the chamber to fill to a point, at which it will empty its contents and start to fill again and the extracted compounds will accumulate in the boiling flask below.

[[Dream]]

CATEGORIES: Everyday life, Psychology, VOA Special English words, Consciousness

Dreams are what a person sees and hears in their mind when they are sleeping. They are often similar to real life in some ways, but can also be very strange. Dreams can seem so real while they happen that the person might think that they are awake when actually they are asleep.

Sometimes a person realizes during a dream that they are dreaming, but keeps having the dream. This is called a lucid dream. This happens very little for most people, but for some people it happens often. During lucid dreaming the person will feel like they are controlling the dream, and will usually dream that they are doing fun things that they can't do in the real world.

Most people remember their dreams in some way or another, even if it is only a small part, but children are very likely to remember most of their dream clearly. It is often easier for people to remember dreams if they write down what happened in the dream just after they wake up. Because of this, many people have dream diaries where they describe each dream they have.

Nightmares are dreams which scare or shock people. Nightmares are usually based around that person's everyday fears, like spiders or dark places, but even a dream that's not about those things can feel unpleasant. Nightmares are caused by many different things: being uncomfortable or in pain while sleeping, sickness, stress, or even eating right before sleeping.

There are many different theories about why people dream and what their dreams mean. Every person has different dreams. Some psychologists believe that dreams reflect what is happening in the unconscious mind (the part of the mind that works by itself). Others think that people, places, and objects in dreams are symbols for other things in the dreamer's real life. Throughout history people have tried to make sense of dreams to learn things from them, and have often used them for divination or fortune-telling. Today there are still many books and websites devoted to making sense of dreams.

Torchwood is a British science fiction television programme. It is about a secret organisation protecting the Earth from aliens. It has been shown on TV channels in Britain including BBC One, BBC Two, and BBC Three. It can be viewed on Netflix and is sometimes shown on American TV channels including Starz . The show is a spin off of the British television series Doctor Who. It follows the Cardiff, Wales section of a secret group called the Torchwood Institute. The Torchwood Institute examines things that aliens cause to happen on Earth. They also collect alien equipment to use.

The series is set in Cardiff, Glamorgan, Wales. Series 1 takes place after Doctor Who Series 2. Series 2 takes place in between Doctor Who Series 3 and Series 4. Because the shows are science fiction and some characters live forever, it is hard to track down the exact times in which Doctor Who and Torchwood overlap.

Torchwood stars John Barrowman as Captain Jack Harkness, the leader of the Cardiff Torchwood Institute. Barrowman also played Harkness in Series 1, Series 3 and Series 4 of the current Doctor Who (2005). Eve Myles plays Gwen Cooper, a policewoman who joins the group. Gareth David-Lloyd stars as Ianto Jones, a person who helps out and is a love interest of Jack. Jack Harkness, Ianto Jones, and Gwen Cooper are the central cast members. Also, Naoko Mori plays scientist Toshiko Sato. Burn Gorman plays Doctor Owen Harper.

Because the show is set in and around Cardiff, many of the local attractions like the Millennium Centre and Cardiff Bay are shown in the series. Country settings around Glamorgan are also used many times in the series.

The programme is aimed at adults and older teenagers.

The third series is a five episode long story named Children of Earth. Children of Earth has returning cast members John Barrowman as Captain Jack Harkness, Eve Myles as Gwen Cooper, and Gareth David-Lloyd as Ianto Jones.

The fourth series is a ten episode story named Miracle Day. Miracle Day has returning cast members John Barrowman as Captain Jack Harkness and Eve Myles as Gwen Cooper.

[[Fermion]]

CATEGORIES: Elementary particles

A fermion is a category of elementary particles. They are very small and very light. Fermions can be thought of as the building blocks of matter because atoms are made up of fermions. Paul Dirac named them fermions in honor of the famous scientist Enrico Fermi.

An electron (a charged particle) is a fermion, but a photon (the particle of electromagnetic radiation) is not.  The spin numbers of fermions are 1/2, 3/2, 5/2, etc. Because their spin is not a whole number, they follow the Pauli exclusion principle: no two fermions can share a quantum state (which includes position in space), if they have the same quantum numbers, such as spin. In other words, fermions can collide with each other. This behavior is not in the other class of elementary particles called bosons: you can have many bosons, for example photons, in the same place at the same time. The motion of fermions follows the Fermi-Dirac statistics.

Most well known fermions have spin of 1/2. An example of a type of fermion with a spin of 1/2 is the electron. The electron belongs to a group of fermions called leptons.

Fundamental fermions (fermions that are not made up of anything else) are either quarks or leptons. There are 6 different types of quarks (called "flavours") and 6 different types of leptons. These are their names:

Each of these fermions also has an anti-particle associated with it, so there are a total of 24 different fundamental fermions. The anti-particle is similar to the original particle, but with opposite electrical charge. The "up", "charm", and "top" quarks have electrical charge of +2/3. Their anti-particles have charge -2/3 (anti-up, anti-charm, anti-top). The other three quarks (down, strange and bottom) have charge -1/3, and their anti-particles have charge +1/3. The electron, muon, and tau leptons all have charge of -1, and their anti-particles (anti-electron or "positron", anti-muon, anti-tau) have charge +1. All the neutrinos and anti-neutrinos have charge 0. The main difference between quarks or leptons with the same charge is their mass.

The supersymmetric counterpart of any fermion is called a "sfermion."

[[Boson]]

CATEGORIES: Elementary particles, Subatomic particles

A boson is a particle which carries a force. It has a whole number spin (spin is a property of subatomic particles).  Bosons carry energy. 

A photon is an example of a boson as it has a spin of 1 and carries electromagnetism. Mesons are also bosons as they carry nuclear force.

Bosons are different from fermions, which are particles that make up matter, because bosons obey Bose-Einstein statistics. (This means that you can put two of them in the same place at the same time; the Pauli exclusion principle does not apply.) 

Gauge bosons carry fundamental forces. There are three known gauge bosons, which are elementary particles.  For example, the photon carries the electromagnetic force. The three types of gauge bosons are: photons for electromagnetism, gluons (eight kinds) for strong force, and W and Z bosons (three kinds) for weak force. Other theoretical gauge bosons are predicted, such as gravitons for gravity. The Higgs boson is another fundamental particle of a type called a scalar boson.

Paul Dirac named this class of particles "bosons" in honor of a famous Indian scientist called Satyendra Nath Bose.

The bosons include the photon, the gluon, the Z boson, W boson and the Higgs boson. The Higgs boson also might be classified by itself. sinse none of them have a charge the anti matter vision of them will also not have any charge.

Dead Kennedys were a hardcore punk band from San Francisco. The band was led by Jello Biafra. Other original members were Klaus Fluoride, D.H. Peligro, and East Bay Ray. The band played songs with strong political messages.  During the 1980s, they had many fans in the punk rock music scene.

The Dead Kennedys formed in June 1978. In 1980, one of their songs called "California Über Alles" became popular in the punk music scene.  In 1980, they recorded and released a song called  "Holiday in Cambodia". That same year, they made their first album, Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables. In the early 1980s, the band toured all over the United States, Europe, and Australia.

In July of 1987, the band broke up. After they broke up, they were charged with the crime of obscenity. A person saw the band's album Frankenchrist  and complained to the Attorney General for the State of California and to Los Angeles prosecutors. The album included a picture that showed nine penises. In August 1987, the criminal trial ended but the jury could not make a decision. The album was banned from many record stores in the United States.

[[Xenarthra]]

CATEGORIES: Xenarthrans, Mammals of South America

The Xenarthra is a superorder of mammals. It is a group of placental mammals (infraclass Eutheria). They live at present only in the Americas, and are anteaters, tree sloths, and armadillos. 

Their origins can be traced back as far as the Palaeogene (about 60-65 million years ago (mya), shortly after the Mesozoic) in South America.  Xenarthrans developed and diversified extensively in South America during its long period of isolation, invaded the Antilles by the early Miocene, and then spread to Central and North America as part of the Great American Interchange. 

Nearly all of the once abundant big xenarthrans, such as ground sloths, glyptodonts, and pampatheres went extinct at the end of the Pleistocene.

Xenarthrans differ from other placental mammals in several ways. The name Xenarthra means 'strange joints', and was chosen because their vertebral joints have extra articulations and are unlike those of any other mammals. The males lack external testicles, which are instead placed between the bladder and the rectum.  Also, xenarthrans have the lowest metabolic rates among the therians.

This airplane is one of the most significant in modern aviation history on several levels. It was created in 1948 as a strategic nuclear bomber, and first flew in the early 1950s. The B-52 fought its first war, under the code name of "Arc Light" in Vietnam from 1965 through 1973. The B-52 is a direct ancestor of many of the airliners which have made Boeing Aircraft, one of the most successful privately owned aerospace company in the world. The B-52 will stay in military service until around 2040. It is not clear what will replace it as the United States Air Force's main strategic bomber.

[[Hudson River]]

CATEGORIES: Hudson River

The Hudson River is in the State of New York in the United States. It is about 315 miles (507 km) long. The river runs from Lake Tear of the Clouds near Mount Marcy in Essex County in the north part of the state to New York Harbor in New York City at the south part of the state. It is named for Henry Hudson.

The Hudson River is a special kind of river called an estuary. There is some salt in the water from New York City north until Poughkeepsie. It is then fresh water from Poughkeepsie north until Lake Tear of the Clouds. The border for the salt in the water moves when the tide rises and falls. The Hudson is part of the Erie Canal from New York City to Albany. The Hudson River used to have a lot of pollution from industry, but it is becoming cleaner now.

The lower part of this river separates New York from New Jersey and is sometimes called the North River.

The George Washington Bridge is a suspension bridge over the Hudson River, that connects part of New York City, New York to Fort Lee, New Jersey. It is 4,750 feet (1584 meters) long and was designed by Othmar H. Ammann. Building began on October 21, 1927, and it was opened on October 25, 1931, at a cost of $59 million. A second level was added below the main level and opened to traffic on August 29, 1962.

There are also walkways for pedestrians and bicyclists on the north and south sides of the bridge.

The main span of the bridge is 3500 long and it is 119 wide. It is suspended by four cables, each cable weighing 28,450 tons, and each is made from 26,474 individual wires. The total length of all the wire in the four cables is 107000.

Ammann chose the site for the bridge because the river was narrower at this point. The banks on either side were high, which meant the bridge could be tall enough for ships to pass underneath, without having to build long rising bridge approaches.

[[Salt mine]]

CATEGORIES: Minerals

A salt mine is a mine where salt is taken from the earth. Very often, this is done in the mountains. It is different from a salt evaporation pond, where salt is taken from salt water. Getting salt from different layers of rock in a mountain used to be a very dangerous job. The Romans used to sentence prisoners to this kind of labour.

Usually the salt is mixed with rock that has chlorides and sulfates. 

Empty salt mines are used very often as a storage area, for example, for unused radioactive elements (from nuclear power plants). Salt mines are empty if there is no salt left to take, or if taking the salt that is left would be too expensive.

[[Key signature]]

CATEGORIES: Music theory

A key signature is a group of sharps or flats which are printed at the beginning of a line/measure of music.  It shows which notes have to be changed into sharps or flats.  For example: if there is one sharp in the key signature it will be an F sharp.  It means that every time the note F is written one plays (or sings) an F sharp (on a keyboard: the black note just to the right of the F) instead.

There are twelve major and twelve minor keys (properly called “modes").  This is because a scale can start on any note, and there are twelve notes within an octave: seven white notes and five black notes on a keyboard.  Each major key has its own key signature. The relationship between the keys is explained in the article "circle of fifths".  Each minor key shares a key signature with one of the major keys.

There are fifteen possible key signatures: up to seven sharps, up to seven flats, or no sharps or flats.  The reason why there are fifteen and not twelve is because three of them have two possible names: F sharp major (6 sharps) can also be called G flat, C sharp is D flat and B is C flat.  We call these enharmonic i.e. the same note but with a different name.

There are two reasons for writing a key signature.  Firstly, it saves writing out lots of sharps or flats during the piece.  Secondly, it helps the player to think in the key (music) of the piece.  This helps to understand the music better.

If the composer wants any extra sharps or flats during the piece, or he wants to cancel the ones in the key signature, these can be written in the music.  These are called accidentals.  An accidental is always written before the note it belongs to (we say “C sharp” but we write the sharp sign and then the note C).   As an example:  in a piece in G major all Fs are F sharps.  If the composer wants a C sharp he writes a sharp sign in front of the C that needs to be sharpened.  This will last for the rest of the bar (measure).  If he wants a B flat he has to write it in.  If he wants an F instead of the usual F sharp he writes a natural sign.  There are also double sharps (the sign looks like an x) and double flats (two flat signs).  An F double sharp is an F sharp that has been sharpened.  It is the same note as G.

Key signatures are written at the beginning of each line of music.  This helps the player to remember what the key signature is.  The time signature, however, is only written at the beginning of the piece (the order is: clef – key signature – time signature).  Sometimes music changes key (modulates) during a piece.  If the music is going to stay in the new key for some time the composer may decide to change the key signature.  Another reason for changing the key signature might be that the music has modulated to a key like G sharp major with eight sharps (including a double sharp).  It is easier to read the music if it is written in A flat major (4 flats).  

One can tell from the key signature what key a piece is in so long as one knows whether it is major or minor (see “mode”).  For example: a key signature of one sharp is either G major or E minor.  The best way to find out which it is would be to see whether the end of the piece is based on G major or E minor.  Also: if the piece is in the minor key it is very likely that there will be several accidentals in the piece which sharpen the 7th note of the scale (in this case changing a lot of the Ds to D sharps).

Some modern composers do not use key signatures.  This is often the case when the music is atonal or not very firmly in one key.  If there are lots of sharps and flats and the bars are very long they may write accidentals in front of every note that needs one instead of just once in a bar.  This should be explained at the top of the music.  It may also be because the piece is modal.

[[Virtuoso]]

CATEGORIES: Music, Performing arts

A virtuoso is someone (usually in the performing arts) who is an expert in his or her field. 

A musical virtuoso is one who plays a musical instrument very well.  Musicians who have exceptional talent and can play extremely fast and difficult music are "virtuosi" (plural of "virtuoso").  In the 19th century Niccolò Paganini was a virtuoso violinist as well as a composer.  Franz Liszt was a virtuoso pianist and composer.

Musicians may sometimes talk about “virtuoso music” meaning music which is so difficult that only a virtuoso could play it.

[[Mal Evans]]

CATEGORIES: 1935 births, 1976 deaths, English autobiographers, People from Liverpool, People shot dead by law enforcement officers in the United States, The Beatles

Malcolm 'Mal' Evans (27 May 1935 – 5 January 1976) was a road manager and assistant to The Beatles, the most popular rock and roll band of the 1960s.

Evans was hired to help Neil Aspinall, who was the band's original road manager. Tall and strong, Evans was sometimes called "The Gentle Giant". His wife was called Lil.

Aspinall's and Evans's jobs changed through the years. At first they were in charge of driving the Beatles's musical equipment to places where they were to perform, setting it up ahead of time, and taking it down later to prepare for their next show. As the band became popular, they had other people to help.

Evans sometimes served as a bodyguard to the Beatles, protecting them from fans who got out of control, or might want to hurt members of the band. He also sometimes forged their autographs on photographs, when the band themselves did not have the chance to sign them, and helped choose girls from concert audiences to meet later with the band. (Aspinall also did these duties.) After the Beatles stopped performing live in 1966, he worked for them in other ways.

Along with playing musical instruments on a few of their songs (organ on "You Won't See Me", trumpet on "Helter Skelter", tambourine on "Dear Prudence", and an anvil on "Maxwell's Silver Hammer"), and singing on "Yellow Submarine" and "You Know My Name (Look Up the Number)", Evans also helped with lyrics from time to time. Paul McCartney paid him in cash for help with "Fixing A Hole", instead of giving him co-credit.

Evans appeared on-camera in both Magical Mystery Tour (as a magician), and Let it Be. He is seen during the rooftop concert in Let it Be, stalling the police who had come to stop the Beatles from performing. The sound of their music had caused a traffic jam on the street below.

He was also responsible for Badfinger being signed to the Beatles's record label, Apple Records.

Evans was fired in 1970 by Allen Klein, who had taken over many of the jobs once held by the late Beatles manager, Brian Epstein. Later Evans separated from his wife, and moved to the United States. During 1974 he was a companion and helper to John Lennon, who was staying in Los Angeles while separated from his wife, Yoko Ono.

Early in 1976, Evans had a fight with his girlfriend, who called the police when he locked himself in a room with a air rifle. Fearing he might hurt other people, the police shot him dead. The policeman in charge admitted the shooting "was all a mistake".

Evans wrote an autobiography, Living with the Beatles Legend, which has never been published in full, but extracts were printed in 2005.

[[Embalming]]

CATEGORIES: Death customs

Embalming is the act of preserving a dead body, so it will not decompose.  If a human body is not embalmed, it will start to decay very quickly.  Because of this, most bodies are embalmed if they will be on display (for example, lying in state) for a funeral. 

Embalming is similar to mummification, which many ancient peoples did to dead bodies.  Embalming is different from taxidermy, where only the skin is preserved.

[[Taxidermy]]

CATEGORIES: Biology

Taxidermy (which comes from the Greek word for "the arrangement of skin") is act of taking the skin of an animals and preserving it, by putting it on a fake body. If you perform taxidermy, you taxiderm. Taxidermed animals can be mounted and put on display, sometimes in a museum or a home. People who taxidermy animals are called taxidermists. Many hunters and fishermen taxidermine the animals they catch and kill for trophies. Ones that are on display in museums are used to make dioramas and for educational purposes. Some people taxiderm their pets and other street animals.

[[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base]]

CATEGORIES: Cuba, United States Navy, Politics of the United States, 1903 establishments in North America, 20th-century establishments in Cuba

Guantanamo Bay is a bay in the south of the island of Cuba. Part of it is controlled by the United States. They took control of it in 1903, under a treaty between the United States and Cuba. The current government of Cuba does not see this treaty as legal. They say it violates International law (more specifically, the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 1969).

The southern part of the bay is surrounded by a navy station of the United States. The name of the station (or base) is sometimes shortened to GTMO, called "Gitmo". The mission of this station is to act to prevent terrorism, help people who are fleeing Cuba and stop drug crime.

This base is also now used as a place to keep people captured by American forces from Afghanistan and Iraq. Also some prisoners were taken from other countries, like Britain and France. Some people say that these people do not get the rights that they should get as prisoners of war under the Geneva Conventions. One reason that they are there may be that the laws of the United States do not apply to them. According to some well-known human rights groups, some prisoners have been tortured  and others may have been badly treated according the FBI Inquiry. This has also been reported by some Europeans who were taken by CIA "torture flights" and have now been released.

[[Treason]]

CATEGORIES: Types of crime

Treason is when a person acts against his/ her country. For example, somebody might help another country fight a war against or loot his country by keeping secrets or failing to protect his country. In history, treason has often included the assassination of leaders. Treason against the king was called high treason and treason against a lesser role was called petty treason. A treasonous person is called a traitor. 

Outside the field of law, the word "traitor" can be used to describe a person who betrays a group to which he or she belongs. These accusations can often be unclear when the accused do not consider themselves to be in the group.

Some famous traitors are Judas Iscariot, Benedict Arnold, Philippe Pétain and Vidkun Quisling.

Persons accused of treason can be many. During the Reign of Terror many thousands were executed as traitors. After World War II many thousands of Soviet soldiers who had been prisoners of war were immediately sent to Gulag as traitors.

[[Zatch Bell!]]

CATEGORIES: Animated television series, Anime, Manga

Zatch Bell! is an animated television series, anime, and manga. The series is about a teenage boy, named Kiyo, who found this boy named "Zatch". Zatch is actually a Mamodo. He came from the Mamodo World where hundreds of other Mamodos came from. However, another Mamodo, named Zeno, somehow erased Zatch's memory. Zatch can not remember anything of his past in the Mamodo World. The reason why all the Mamodos are in the real world is to battle. When one enters the world, they must find a human to be their partner and to use a book of spells that came with them. Only humans can read the spells and cause the Mamodo to do a certain action. Examples of these spells would be to create a lightning bolt, create a shield, or move very fast. As a person becomes stronger physically and emotionally new spells are written into the book so that the human can read and use them.

By burning the book, the Mamodo gets sent back to the Mamodo World. If the Mamodo gets badly beaten, he will also be sent away. The last Mamodo standing will be 'King' of the Mamodos. Zatch decides that he wants to be a Belovelent King or Kind King to stop all the battles. In their adventure, they come across many enemies and allies.

[[Harmonic series (music)]]

CATEGORIES: Music theory, Sound

Harmonics in music are notes which are produced in a special way. They are notes which are produced as part of the “harmonic series”.

In physics, a harmonic is a wave which is added to the basic fundamental wave. This article talks about sound waves, which can be understood clearly by looking at the strings of a musical instrument.

When a violinist plays a note on a violin string, the string starts to vibrate very fast. This vibration makes the air vibrate and the sound waves travel to our ear so that we can hear it. If the note were absolutely pure the string would move in a perfect sinusoidal shape and produce only one frequency, but instead there are multiple frequencies being produced at the same time along with the main one. The note played on the violin string makes the string vibrate in a very complicated way. There is the basic note (the fundamental), but added to that are lots of other little notes that all add up to a sound in a special way that tells us that it is a violin playing and not a clarinet or a human voice.

The higher the note, the faster the string vibrates. An A above middle C (the violinist’s A string) vibrates at 440Hz (440 times per second). This is the “fundamental” or “first harmonic”. The second harmonic vibrates twice as fast (ratio 2:1): 880Hz. This gives an A an octave higher. The third harmonic will give a ratio 3:2. This will be an E (an octave and a fifth above the fundamental). The higher the harmonic the quieter it is, but the ratio is always a whole number (not a fraction).

Every note that is played on an instrument is really a combination of several notes or “harmonics”, even though we may not realize that we are hearing more than one note at a time. Play the lowest C on the piano. Now find the next C which is an octave higher. Press this key very slowly so that it does not sound and hold it down. While holding it down play the bottom C again making it loud and very short. The C that is being held silently will now sound. This is because the strings of that C are vibrating a little because it is a harmonic of the low C (they can vibrate because the damper is off the string while the note is being held down). The same can be done holding the next G down, then the next C, then the E. The higher the note the fainter (quieter) the harmonics become. The musical example below shows the notes of a harmonic series in musical notation.

[[Hamburger]]

CATEGORIES: Sandwiches, German food, American food

A hamburger or burger is an American fast food. It is a type of sandwich with a patty of cooked ground meat between the two halves of a bun. Tomatoes, onions, cheese, salad and dips may also be added. The hamburger may be eaten without a knife and fork, so it is a fast food which can be eaten anywhere. 

Hamburgers are named for a city in Germany called Hamburg. They were probably invented in Germany, though what we now know as a hamburger was created in the United States in the 19th century. Hamburgers appeared on menus in England and the United States in the 19th century, and became a popular food after the 1904 World's Fair.  What is called a hamburger throughout the world today was different than the first German hamburgers; German dishes often involved a steak or sausage between pieces of bread instead of ground meat.

Many American fast food restaurants, such as Burger King, KFC and McDonald's, serve hamburgers.

A cheeseburger is a hamburger that also has cheese.  Hamburgers can be served with other things besides cheese, such as chili.

Even though the name has the word ham in it, it doesn’t need to have ham.

[[Meow]]

CATEGORIES: Cats

A meow or miaow is a noise made by cats. There are different types of meows, such as ones that mean the same thing as "hello," ones that ask for food, or ones that let people know when they are annoyed, among other things.

The meow is used by kittens to their mother. It is a plea for attention, and experts think pet cats use it because they often need owners to do things for them. Adult cats do not meow to other cats.

Different languages have different ways of spelling "meow." For example, English has been using the meow spelling since 1842 and before that, it used the miaow, miau, or meaw spellings. Spanish and German still use the miau spelling while French uses the miaou spelling. 

Cats in Ancient Egypt were called "Mau".

[[October Revolution]]

CATEGORIES: Russian Revolution, 1917 in Russia

The October Revolution was a revolution in Russia that started on 1917 November 7 (October 25 o.s.). The Bolsheviks were led by Vladimir Ilyich Lenin and Leon Trotsky. They overthrew the previous Russian Provisional Government led by Alexander Kerensky. Its uprising started on 24 October.

The Bolsheviks faced little or no opposition. The insurrection was timed and organized to hand state power to the Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies, which began on 25 October. After a single day of revolution eighteen people had been arrested and two had been killed. The Bolsheviks captured telegraph and telephone offices, railway stations, newspaper offices and government institutions. Red Guards (armed workers), sailors from the Baltic fleet, and parts of the army fought for the revolution.

The October Revolution inspired a revolutionary wave across the world, including the Hungarian revolution, the German revolution of 1918-1919, and the Chinese revolution of 1925-27.

[[Experience]]

[[Miranda (moon)]]

CATEGORIES: Uranus' moons

Miranda is one of Uranus' moons. It is the smallest, and the one which has the least rotation time. Gerard Kuiper discovered it in 1948, February 16th and named it after Miranda, Prospero's daughter in William Shakespeare's play The Tempest. Sometimes it is also called Uranus V. 

It's one of Uranus' strangest moons. Its complex surface may indicate partial melting of its interior, with icy material drifting to the surface. 

The probe Voyager 2 made some photos in 1986. These are the only images that exist, so far. Geologically, it is the most active body in the Uranus system. The grooves and troughs reach depths of a few kilometers (or miles) and expose materials of different albedos (reflectivity). The features suggest a long, complex geologic evolution of this satellite. 

[[Trombone]]

CATEGORIES: Trombones

The trombone is a brass horn musical instrument. It is similar to a large trumpet, except the player pushes and pulls on its slide to change the length of the tube.

Together with vibrations from the player's lips, the trombone can play a wide range of notes. It sounds deeper than a trumpet and is usually said to be one of the bass clef instruments.  Music is normally written in the bass clef, but some high parts can be written in tenor clef. Some players have the music transposed into the treble clef. The trombone is the loudest instrument in the symphony orchestra. 

A person who plays the trombone is called a trombonist. Some trombones have a valve which increases the range of available notes. The name trombone comes from the Italian language and means large trumpet. Trombones are nearly always made out of brass but can also be made out of plastic: the "P-bone".

[[Cartilage]]

CATEGORIES: Skeletal system, Animal tissues

Cartilage is a flexible connective tissue found in many parts of the body. It can bend a bit, but resists stretching.

Its main function is to connect bones together. It is also found in the joints, the rib cage, the ear, the nose, the throat and between the bones of the back. Another function of cartilage is to create a place on which bones can form when they are first developed. It also helps to protect the places where bones work against each other: the joints. In some fish like sharks (Chondrichthyes), cartilage forms the whole of the skeleton.

Unlike other connective tissues, cartilage does not contain blood vessels. The cells are supplied by diffusion. So, compared to other connective tissues, cartilage grows and repairs more slowly. Cartilage also does not contain nerves, making the hard tissue painless if damage is caused. However, the breaking of a cartilage often results in damage to tendons and muscles, which certainly does cause pain.

There are many diseases caused by defects in cartilage. One of the most common is osteoarthritis, where the cartilage wears so thin that bone rubs against bone. Cartilage acts as a barrier, preventing the entry of lymphocytes or diffusion of immunoglobulins. This allows surgeons to transplant of cartilage from one person to another without fear of tissue rejection.

Following two decades of planning, the system began operations in November 1987 with 5 stations spread over 6 of track. The network has since grown quickly in accordance with Singapore's aim of developing a complex rail network as the core of the country's public transportation system, averaging a daily ridership of 3.384 million in 2019.

It is a rapid transit system which links the different places of Singapore together using a network, or different connections of trains. When a person travels from one place to another, he or she boards a train in a train station and then the train moves until the train reaches the place he or she wants to come out, or alight from. Sometimes he or she has to change trains.

César Cui (born Vilnius, 18 January 1835; died 26 March 1918) was a Russian composer. He is the least known of the five Russian composers who were nicknamed the “Moguchaya Kuchka” (“Mighty Handful”), a group which included Mily Balakirev, Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, Modest Mussorgsky and Alexander Borodin. Cui’s father came from France and his mother from Lithuania. 

Like most Russian composers in the 19th century he was an amateur composer. His main job was as an expert on military fortifications. He became a professor in this subject and wrote important textbooks about military defences. He became a general.

Cui liked his friends from the Moguchaya Kuchka, but was often very critical of music by other Russian composers such as Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninoff. This may have been because he was jealous of their success. He did not find orchestration easy and Balakirev helped him a lot with the orchestration of some of his compositions. He was best when writing songs and short piano pieces. He liked to write music that sounded Far Eastern in character. Cellists like to play a short piece he wrote called “Orientale”.

[[Corrosion]]

CATEGORIES: Chemical processes, Metallurgy

Corrosion is the breakdown of materials due to chemical reactions. It is usually oxidation with air molecules and often in the presence of water. Corrosion also occurs when an acidic/basic corrosive substance touches another material. When a material corrodes, its physical properties change. Problems with corrosion are mostly with metal, though other materials can corrode. Corrosion is a form of erosion. Some materials, such as stainless steel, are highly resistant to corrosion. Metals that may corrode can be protected by plating, painting, and other means.

One form of high temperature corrosion can lead to the formation of compacted oxide layer glazes, which under certain circumstances reduces wear. 

Iron corrosion is called rusting.

[[Rust]]

CATEGORIES: Metals

Rust is a type of corrosion. It happens to iron and its alloys when it is exposed to air or water for a long time. Rust slowly decomposes iron into other chemicals, because of a reaction with the oxygen molecules. Both air and water are needed for rust. Almost all metals corrode but they can be protected by covering with paint, a coating of oil or grease or even plastic.  Sacrificial protection or industrial galvanizing can also work.  Alloys (mixes of metals) such as stainless steel, rust more slowly than pure iron.  When iron rusts, it becomes red or brown, and the metal eventually decays.

Rust appears on metal if it is left outside in the damp air. For example, rust occurs mostly in cracks of alloys or metals.  Rain water can enter the cracks and stay in the cracks, and cause the metal to corrode.  Eventually it becomes rust.  Iron is not strong after it rusts.

Some metals, such as aluminium, titanium, and stainless steel form a very thin coating of tough corrosion on the metal. The metal cannot continue corroding because the coating isolates the rest of the metal from the source of oxygen. This is why aluminium keeps its shine. It also makes aluminium seem very unreactive, even though it can react with water. Rusting iron makes iron oxides that are not tough, so air and water continue to get in and the iron continues to rust.

Some types of basidiomycete fungi can be mistaken for rust because they are similar to rust in color and texture and sometimes are on metals.

Werner Karl Heisenberg (5 December 1901  1 February 1976) was a German physicist. He won the  Nobel Prize in Physics for his discovery of quantum mechanics. He discovered the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which shows there is a limit on how well position and velocity of a particle can be measured.

Heisenberg was born in Wuerzburg, Germany, the son of a professor of Byzantine history. He went to university to study physics in Munich. Arnold Sommerfeld was one of his teachers. 

Heisenberg was a very good student and needed only three years to finish his studies. He then wrote a doctoral thesis about movements in the flows of liquids ("Über Stabilität und Turbulenz von Flüssigkeitsströmen"—"On the stability and turbulence of liquid streams"). In 1924 he became assistant to Max Born at the University of Göttingen. In June 1925 he was recovering from hay fever on the island Helgoland, and while working alone made the decisive breakthrough to Quantum mechanics. Back in Göttingen, together with Max Born and Pascual Jordan, they wrote the basic paper which founded Quantum 

mechanics. 

In 1926/ 1927 Heisenberg worked with Niels Bohr at the University of Copenhagen. In February 1927, while Bohr was on extended skiing holidays, he invented the uncertainty principle and published the paper “Über den anschaulichen Inhalt der quantentheoretischen Kinematik und Mechanik”—“On the Visualizable Contents of the Quantum-theoretical Kinematics and Mechanics”.

At the age of 26 Heisenberg became professor of theoretical physics at the University of Leipzig.

He was awarded the Nobel Prize when he was 31 years old.

In 1937 he married Elisabeth Schumacher. They had seven children, one of their sons is well known as a neurobiologist and geneticist, Martin Heisenberg.

[[Islamophobia]]

CATEGORIES: Islamophobia, Psychology, Discrimination

Islamophobia is a political term and a slur used against people critical of Islam. It literally means the fear of Muslims. It is sometimes used to describe a hatred of the religion and its followers. "Islamophobia" can supposedly take the form of criticisms against certain ideological positions taken by believers but almost always state the religion itself as the actual problem.

In 1996, the Runnymede Trust researched public opinions about Islam. The research showed people have different opinions about Islam. The most negative opinions that some people have about Islam are:

A study found that Muslim women experienced Islamophobic attacks more often than Muslim men, but almost all are committed by Muslim men.

In France it is illegal for Muslim women to wear veils (burqas and niqabs) that cover their faces.

[[Centipede]]

CATEGORIES: Myriapods

A centipede is a type of myriapod with many legs. Centipedes are predators. They hunt during the night; they are nocturnal.  Some centipedes are venomous, but none can kill a person unless they are allergic. Centipedes are in the class Chilopoda, and related to millipedes, which are not poisonous. As the millipedes, they are segmented. They have between 5 and 173 segments, but only one pair of legs per segment. There may be 8,000 species in the world.

The house centipede is a carnivore that feeds on cockroaches, house flies and other domestic pests. It is therefore beneficial. But because it has a scary appearance it is often exterminated.

[[Conscientious objector]]

CATEGORIES: Politics, War

A conscientious objector (CO) is a person who decides not to be a combatant in military forces.

There are many reasons for this decision such as nonviolent or religious beliefs, ethical and moral beliefs to not kill human beings or pacifism.

Countries treat COs in various ways. They have also been treated differently throughout history. COs have been arrested or had to pay a fine. Some countries punished them by killing them. After World War II, many Western countries created alternative non-military services (civil service) as alternative form for pacifists. Often there were commissions to decide if someone really did not want to do armed service because of his beliefs or because of fear of war.

European Court of Human Rights has judged the denial of COs is violation of freedom of religion and thought in 2013, as well European Union recognized the right of conscientious objector as one of fundamental rights.

[[Rule of law]]

CATEGORIES: Law

Rule of law is a legal maxim that suggests that no one is above the law and governmental decisions must be made only by applying known legal and moral principles. The Rule of Law limits the powers of Government by judicial defense of laws and the Constitution which is based on recognized basic legal values, established in international law. The Rule of Law is meant to prevent dictatorship and to protect the rights of the people.

The Rule of Law is especially important as an influence on the economic development in developing and transitional countries. Constitutional economics is the study of  government spending, which, in many transitional and developing countries, is completely controlled by the executive. The standards of constitutional economics can be used during annual budget process. The availability of an effective court system, to be used by the civil society in courts in situations of unfair governmental distribution of national money is a key element for the success of the rule-of-law in developing countries.

To date, the term “rule of law” has been used primarily in the English-speaking countries.  The originally German doctrine of Rechtsstaat is similar, and has been translated into other languages of continental Europe as État de droit (Fr.), Estado de derecho (Sp.), Stato di diritto (It.), and Правовое государство (Ru.).  Rechsstaat can be translated into English as “legal state” or "constitutional state".  

Rule of law is also a main purpose of Council of Europe for solidarity and international peace.

[[Chord]]

CATEGORIES: Music theory

A chord in music is when two or more notes are played together (some text books say that it is when three or more notes are played).

A chord which is built up of the 1st, 3rd and 5th notes of a scale is called a "tonic triad". If it is made from a major scale, it is a major chord. If it is made from a minor scale it is a minor chord. However, any combination of notes played simultaneously is considered a chord.

When only two notes are played together, it’s more often called “double stops” (referring to the different banks of pipes on a pipe organ, controlled by valves called “stops”).

Chords can be played on instruments such as piano, keyboard, organ, harp, guitar, harmonica, ukulele and xylophone. Chords with two notes can be played on string instruments by bowing on two strings together. By bowing on two strings and then quickly on the other two strings a violinist can sound as if he is playing a four-part chord. Some players of wind instruments are able to make chords by playing two or more harmonics together.

[[Irish dance]]

CATEGORIES: Dances

Irish dancing is an ancient art of dancing from Ireland. There are two main forms of dancing, the social dances where everyone can join in, and the dances performed for an audience. There are five main types of steps in Irish dancing. These are reels, jigs, slip jigs, hornpipes, and treble jigs. Irish dancing is a fun art and sport. There are two versions of dances; hardshoe and softshoe.

Irish dancing, popularized in 1994 by the world famous show Riverdance, is notable for its rapid leg and foot movements, arms stationary at the dancers' sides.

The hardshoe makes a noise when you step and softshoe is like Ballet.

[[Grill (cooking)]]

CATEGORIES: Cooking appliances, Cooking methods

A grill is an object used for cooking food. With a grill, food is usually roasted. Some grills use charcoal or wood, and other grills use propane gas to cook the food.  

Using wood or charcoal makes smoke and changes the flavor of the food. Using gas does not. Some people only like one type, and some people like both kinds of grilling.

The heat may be added underneath the food, or above, or both. A barbecue is a typical machine for outdoor cooking using coke or other fuel for providing heat from underneath. Overhead grilling is more usual indoors, especially in professional kitchens.

In the United States, there are cook-off grills, which are competitions. The most common meats used are steak, burgers and hot dogs.  Grilling food is very common for holidays or celebrations like the 4th of July (United States Independence Day).  Most people use a grill more outdoors in the summer time.

Grills can have fire touching the food. This might cause a burnt taste and could possibly be a carcinogen.

[[Order of operations]]

CATEGORIES: Arithmetics

The order of operations is a mathematical and algebraic set of rules. It is used to evaluate (solve) and simplify expressions and equations. The order of operations is the order that different mathematical operations are done. The standard mathematical operations are addition (+), subtraction (−), multiplication (* or ×), division (/), brackets (grouping symbols used to indicate order of operations like (), ''' and ) and exponentiation (^n or n''', also called orders or indices).

Mathematicians have agreed on a correct order to use operations, and it is very important that they know these rules. When people are solving a problem with more than one operation, they will need to know the correct order to solve the problem correctly. Otherwise, the answer will be wrong.

[[Crystal]]

CATEGORIES: Chemistry

A crystal is a solid whose atoms (or molecules) are arranged in a repeating pattern. 

Crystals are made from fluids by Crystallization, which is a kind of phase change. Usually the fluid is a liquid, but crystals can form from a gas too. For example, snow is water crystals (ice) formed from air that contains water vapor (evaporated water). Crystallization can be by freezing from a simple fluid or from a solution. Sometimes heat and pressure needs to be applied to a substance for crystals to form. Diamond is a carbon crystal formed under heat and pressure. Crystals are found naturally or can be made artificially.

The surface of crystals often have regions that are flat, called facets. Facets occur naturally as crystals form, because flat layers of atoms are usually the most stable. The atoms in a facet are arranged in a regular pattern, such as the pattern of a chess board or a honeycomb. These facets reflect light to give crystals their shiny or sparky appearance. Artificial facets can be made in any shape by cutting or grinding a crystal, which is how some gemstones for jewelry are made. 

Different substances form different types of crystals. The study of the arrangement of atoms in crystals is crystallography. Well-known substances that form crystals are table salt (whose crystals are cubes), diamond, and quartz. 

[[Indirect democracy]]

CATEGORIES: Democracy

Indirect democracy, or representative democracy, is when citizens elect representatives to make laws for them. This is what most modern countries have today.

In many representative democracies (USA, Canada, India, etc.) representatives are chosen in elections.  Elections may be won by plurality or majority or some other way.   In theory other methods, such as allotment (selection by a lottery) could be used instead.  Also, representatives sometimes hold the power to select other representatives, presidents, or other officers of government (indirect representation).

Direct democracy is where citizens themselves vote for or against specific proposals or laws. Some city states in Ancient Greece had this system. With the large populations in modern countries it is possible only occasionally to do this. It happens in a plebiscite or referendum.

In a democracy the ultimate power to decide significant electoral system reforms lies with the people. The key question that democrats will tend to ask of any proposed change in electoral law or the voting mechanism is: “Will it actually increase the capacity of the electorate to get rid of unsatisfactory rulers and replace them with others?” Democrats regard that basic capacity as the best protection against bad government and the abuse of power. 

Systems of government which do not permit electors to change the government are not democratic, and usually are dictatorships or one-party states.

[[Direct democracy]]

CATEGORIES: Anarchism, Democracy

Direct democracy, which is also called pure democracy is a democracy in which the decisions are not taken by representatives. All decisions are voted on by the people.

When a budget or law needs to be passed, then the idea goes to the people. Large governments rarely make decisions this way.

[[Revolution]]

CATEGORIES: Politics

A revolution is a very sharp change made to something. The word comes from Latin, and is related to the word revolutio (which means a turn around). 

Revolutions are usually political in their nature. Some people feel unhappy with their lives, some are not happy with whole systems. They might join together, share their ideas, and make something change. Often, revolutions include fighting, and civil unrest. But there are also revolutions that happen without fighting.

The Soviet Union was made by the Russian Revolution that killed millions, and later fell apart in a counterrevolution without much fighting. But in the French Revolution (1789), there was much bloodshed. The years right after this Revolution in France are often called the Reign of Terror.

Other events often called "revolutions" include:

The opposing idea in politics is called 'gradualism'.

[[Speech]]

CATEGORIES: Language, Speeches

Speech is when spoken language is used to communicate. Only humans have language. Animals do not have speech, but some can communicate with each other by using sounds and gestures. 

Speech is made by sounds vibrating the vocal folds. Sounds through the voice box is shaped by the jaw, tongue, teeth, palate, lips, and nose.

To make speech a person has to be able to:

Difficulties can happen at any stage of this four-stage process. A speech and language therapist can help work out the stage of the sequence that has difficulties and give therapy.

Effective speech includes the following elements – fluency, flexibility, accuracy, and comprehensibility.

Darth Vader is a fictional character from the Star Wars universe. He appears for the first time in A New Hope. Vader is the main character of the Dark Side of the Star Wars series. He appears as a 2 meter-tall man dressed in black armor and a cape. His face is covered with a mask, which has a helmet on top to hide the terrible third degree burns and scars on his face. He has borderline personality disorder.

[[Gesture]]

CATEGORIES: Non-verbal communication

A gesture is a form of nonverbal communication. Unlike verbal communication, which uses words, gestures use movements of the body. 

Gestures are deliberate acts with a purpose, not just any movements. They are handled in the human brain by the same centres which handle language. In the neocortex, Broca's and Wernicke's areas, are used by speech and sign language.

Other movements of the body have meaning, but are not gestures. They may be done by actors deliberately, but normally they are automatic, unconscious signals which express various feelings or states of mind. Many animals communicate extensively using such behaviours. The dog, a companion to humans for a long time, is good at reading both gestures and behaviours. Multi-touch computers have been made to read gestures. 

Gestures have a cultural significance (meaning). The same gesture can mean different things in different cultures and different parts of the world.

[[Palpatine]]

CATEGORIES: Fictional characters introduced in 1980, Galactic emperors, Internet memes, Star Wars characters

Darth Sidious (born as Sheev Palpatine and also known as the Emperor) is a fictional character from the Star Wars universe. He is the main villain of the Star Wars movies. His most famous power, seen only once, is force lightning seen in the last episode Return of the Jedi which is forked to spread the damage even further and is blueish purple. 

He is played by Ian McDiarmid. He is seen in Episode V for the first time. Darth Sidious is regarded as the true villain of the Star Wars films because he was the one who caused Anakin Skywalker to join the Dark Side of the Force.

In Episode I, The Phantom Menace, he is a Senator from the planet of Naboo. He is also secretly a Sith Lord, Darth Sidious. Sidious pulls the strings behind the scenes to cause unrest and dispute in the corrupt Galactic Senate, hence the films' title. His apprentice during this time is Darth Maul, who is slain in battle by Obi-Wan Kenobi. At the end of Episode I, he has risen to the office of Supreme Chancellor and begins his rise to power.

In Episode II, Attack of the Clones, Sidious secretly continues to bring the galaxy to civil war. He has a new apprentice, Count Dooku, who leads the Separatist Droid Army and goes by the name 'Darth Tyranus'. Dooku is slain by Anakin Skywalker on a rescue mission to free the Chancellor in Episode III, Revenge of the Sith.

Sidious rose to complete power in Episode III, when he sent Anakin to lead an attack on the Jedi Temple and ordered the Clone Troopers to execute Order 66, killing many Jedi in the process. Sidious battled Yoda in a duel which would decide the fate of the Galaxy. He narrowly defeated Yoda, and was able to form a new order upon the fallen Republic. He created the first Galactic Empire. In the time frame from his creation of the Empire and his death, Sidious was a cold, merciless Emperor. He ruled through fear. His evil was staggering as he dominated the galaxy with his ruthless enforcer, Darth Vader.  

Darth Sidious ruled the galaxy for 23 years, when in the end he was killed by his own apprentice, Darth Vader. He later cloned himself and had a granddaughter named Rey.

Since the initial theatrical run of Return of the Jedi, Sidious has become a widely recognized symbol of evil in popular culture, and since the prequel films, also one of sinister deception and the subversion of democracy.

The silkworm is the larva( the active immature form of an insect)or caterpillar of the Bombyx mori moth. Silk has been made for at least 5000 years in China. The moth is important because it makes silk. It is entirely dependent on humans, and it no longer lives in the wild. Silkworms eat mulberry leaves, and are native to northern China.

The domesticated B. mori and the wild Bombyx mandarina can still breed and sometimes produce hybrids.342

[[Mulberry]]

CATEGORIES: Trees, Berries, Moraceae, Rapid plant movement

Mulberry (Morus) is a genus of 10–16 species of trees. They are native to warm regions of Asia, Africa and the Americas, with most of the species native to Asia.

Mulberries are fast-growing when young, but soon become slow-growing and rarely grow over 10-15 meters tall. The leaves are simple, often lobed, and ridged. The fruit grows in bunches, 2-3 centimeters long, is red to dark purple in color, edible, and sweet with a good flavor in several species.

The fruit is used in pies, tarts, and wines. The fruit of the Black Mulberry, native to southwest Asia, and the Red Mulberry, native to eastern North America, have the strongest flavor. The fruit of the White Mulberry, an east Asian species, has a very weak flavor.

Mulberries can be grown from seeds, and this is the best idea as seedling-grown trees are generally healthier. However, they are most often planted from large pieces cut from other Mulberry trees, which easily take root.

[[Procaine]]

CATEGORIES: Analgesics

Procaine is a analgesic drug. It is used primarily to reduce the pain of getting certain shots, and is also used by dentists. The drug is usually sold under the name Novocaine, or Novacaine.

Procaine was first made in 1905, and was the first man-made pain-killer that could be taken as a shot. It was created by the German scientist Alfred Einhorn (1857-1917) who gave the chemical the name Novacaine, from the Latin word novus (which means new) and caine, as in "cocaine."

Procaine is not often used today because other safer and better working pain-killing drugs now exist. Prior to the discovery of procaine, cocaine was the most commonly used pain-killer. Procaine (like cocaine) has the advantage of reducing bleeding, unlike other pain-killers and without the dangerous qualities of cocaine.

[[Leizu]]

CATEGORIES: Kings and queens, Chinese royalty

Leizu was a legendary Chinese queen. According to tradition, she discovered silk and invented the silk loom in the 28th century BC.

Leizu discovered silkworms while on a walk near the king's mulberry trees. However, there are different stories of exactly how she discovered that silkworms make silk.

One story says that she used her finger to touch a worm, causing a strand of silk to come out. As the silk continued to come out, she wrapped it around her finger. When the silk ran out, she saw a small cocoon, and realized that this cocoon was the source of the silk. 

Another story says that she found silkworms eating the mulberry leaves and spinning cocoons. She collected some cocoons, and then sat down to have some tea. While she was sipping a cup of tea, she dropped a cocoon into the steaming water. A fine thread started to separate itself from the cocoon. Leizu found that she could unwind this soft and lovely thread around her finger.

She asked her husband to give her a grove of mulberry trees, where she could keep the worms that made these cocoons. She is credited with inventing the silk reel, which joins thin silk threads into a thicker thread strong enough for weaving. She is also credited with inventing the first silk loom. It is not known how much, if any, of this story is true, but historians do know that silk was first made in China. Leizu shared what she found out with others and the knowledge became common.

[[Reforesting]]

CATEGORIES: Forests

Reforesting is the process of replacing plants in an area where they have been cut down or destroyed. It usually refers to trees, but could include other types of plant life. 

Reforestation is often needed after deforestation, when trees are cut down to make lumber. 

Reforestation also regains back the homes of animals. 

[[Moth]]

CATEGORIES: Moths

Moths are insects of the order Lepidoptera. They are closely related to butterflies, which evolved from them. They also have wings, just like butterflies. Most species of moths are active only at night. They can be told apart from butterflies in several ways. Moth antenna look like little feathers,  and their wings are held flat on their backs when they are not flying.

Most Lepidoptera are moths. There are thought to be about 160,000 species of moths (nearly ten times the number of species of butterflies). Thousands of species are still to be described. Most moths are tiny: they are called micromoths or microlepidoptera. The large moths are much better known, but fewer. Most species of moths are nocturnal, but not all. There are crepuscular and diurnal species.

[[Cocoon]]

CATEGORIES: Lepidoptera

A cocoon is a shell made of silk by most kinds of moth caterpillars and other insect larvae. Some butterfly larvae (in the family Hesperiidae and subfamilies Parnassiinae and Satyrinae) do spin cocoons. However, most butterfly pupae are called chrysalids. Some caterpillars attach small twigs or pieces of vegetation to the outside of their cocoon to hide it from predators. Others spin their cocoon in a hidden place. Examples would be on the underside of a leaf, in a crevice, or down near the base of a tree trunk.

Silkworm cocoons are processed and used to produce natural silk for clothing.

The Columbine High School massacre was a school shooting and attempted bombing at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado, near Denver, that happened on April 20, 1999. Eighteen-year-old Eric Harris and 17-year-old Dylan Klebold carried out the massacre and were both students at the school. They murdered 12 students and one teacher using guns. Ten of the murders happened in the school's library, where they then killed themselves with their guns. Before the shootings, they had planted two large propane bombs in the school's cafeteria. They could have killed many people in there, but they did not explode. They also planted two car bombs in the school's parking lot, which were supposed to kill first responders and news reporters. They also did not explode. They also carried pipe bombs and molotov cocktails, which they lit and threw. Most of them exploded but nobody was injured or killed by any of the bombs used during the massacre.

It was one of the first well-known massacres at a school in the United States, and the one with the most deaths until the Virginia Tech massacre in 2007.

[[Nucleic acid]]

CATEGORIES: Molecular biology

Nucleic acids are large molecules where genetic information is stored. There are two types of nucleic acids: deoxyribonucleic acid, better known as DNA and ribonucleic acid, better known as RNA.

The nucleic acids are made of nucleotides. A nucleotide is made of a nitrogenous base, sugar with five carbon atoms and a  phosphate group.

Nucleic acids allow organisms to transfer genetic information from one generation to the next. When a cell divides, its DNA is copied and passed from one cell generation to the next generation. 

DNA is organized into chromosomes and found within the nucleus of our cells. Its function in any cell is to carry the sequence of bases which will be transcribed into RNA. The function of RNA is much more difficult to explain. One well-known function is for messenger RNA to be translated into proteins, mainly enzymes. But there are other types of RNA, and these are called non-coding RNAs.

[[Group home]]

CATEGORIES: Disability

A group home is a private house that serves as a home for people who are not in the same family but have a common characteristic. In the United States, this would mean a home for people who need social assistance or who are not able to live alone or without proper care for safety reasons.  Before the 1970s, these people lived in psychiatric hospitals, homes for the poor and orphanages.

People who live in a group home may be recovering drug addicts, developmentally disabled, abused or neglected youths, and/or young people with a criminal record. A group home is different from a halfway house because it is not restricted to recovering addicts or convicted criminals, and also because the people who live there usually have to help maintain the household by doing chores or helping to manage a budget. In most countries, people can still vote and attend university while in a group home.

There are typically from 3 to 16 residents, as well as a resident manager or service staff. Residents may have their own room or share rooms, and share facilities such as laundry, bathroom, kitchen and common living areas.  The opening of group homes is occasionally fought against by neighbours who fear that it will lead to a rise in crime and/or a drop in property values.

A group home can also refer to family homes in which children and youth of the foster care system are placed until foster families are found for them.

[[Blood pressure]]

CATEGORIES: Blood pressure

Blood pressure is a measurement used in medicine.  In the body, the arteries carry blood away from the heart.  As blood travels through the arteries, it presses against the walls of the arteries.  Blood pressure measures how hard the blood is pushing against the walls of the arteries.  

Usually, "blood pressure" measures the pressure in larger arteries delivering blood to body parts other than the lungs, like the brachial artery in the arm.  Blood pressure is usually measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg).

There are two numbers in a blood pressure.  The first is the systolic pressure.  It measures how hard the blood pushes against the walls of the arteries when the heart is in systole (beating and pushing out blood).  This is when the pressure against the walls of the arteries is highest.  The second number is the diastolic blood pressure.  It measures how hard the blood pushes against the walls of the arteries when the heart is in diastole (resting between beats and not pushing out any blood).  For example, in the picture on this page, the pressure on the walls of the arteries is 122 mmHg when the heart is beating, and 65 mmHg when the heart is resting.  This blood pressure would be written as "122/65" and read as "122 over 65."

Mean arterial pressure is a person's average blood pressure.  Pulse pressure is the difference between the systolic and diastolic pressures.

To measure blood pressure, doctors use a device called a sphygmomanometer.

[[Pride]]

CATEGORIES: Emotions, Seven deadly sins

Pride means having a feeling of being good and worthy. The adjective is proud.

The word pride can be used in a good sense as well as in a bad sense.

In a good sense it means having a feeling of self-respect. People can be satisfied with their achievements. They can be proud of something good that they have done. They can be proud of (or take pride in) their work. They might be proud of their son or daughter or husband or wife or anyone else who is close to them and who has done something good.

Someone who is described as proud may be arrogant. The word is used in this sense in the saying: “Pride comes before a fall” or “Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall.” Prov.16:18 (meaning that someone is so overconfident that he or she might soon have a disaster).

[[King Philip's War]]

CATEGORIES: 17th century in the Thirteen Colonies, History of Native Americans, Wars, 1675, 1676

King Philip's War (Metacom's War) was a war between Native Americans and English colonists. King Philip's War was fought between 1675 and 1676 in the area of the United States that is now New England.

When the Pilgrims left England, they came to live in Massachusetts near the Indians. As more Puritans arrived, they needed more land and they took it.  Metacom, or "King Philip" as he was called in English was the leader of one of the Wampanoag Pokanoket tribes.  His father had made a treaty with the English.

The English began to fear the power of the natives.  The two sides accused each other of violating the treaty and preparing for war.  John Wussausmon was Christian convert and a trader.  He told the English that Philip was preparing an alliance to attack them.  When he was found dead, the English executed three Indians for his murder, and people on both sides became more angry.  Philip brought together a large force of Indians and attacked the Puritan settlements.  The resulting war was large.  The Indians lost and thousands of them died but not before the whole countryside suffered much loss.  Many towns burned and every inhabitant was enveloped some way in the conflict. When King Philip was killed by a native, his head was cut off by Benjamin Church to be brought back to Plymouth.  500 Indians were also taken prisoner and made slaves.

It was settled in the 13th century. The main branches of industry were porcelain-making, forestry, and the production of charcoal. Rafts were built to get the wood into the larger cities, along the Main river, and the Rhine. First, the people setlted on the plateau. They cut down some forest, and settled in the clearing that was created that way. A well preserved example of such a setltlement is Wilhelmsthal. Only at a later date did people settle in the valleys.

[[Rapid transit]]

CATEGORIES: Rapid transit

Rapid transit is the name for a type of railway which has trains that run very often and carry many passengers at one time. It is usually in a city or urban area and takes people in and out of it. Trains go between places very quickly because they do not mix with other traffic. Most rapid transit railways do not have level crossings, but the tracks go over and under other roads, or run in tunnels or over bridges, so they do not meet.

[[File:Metro in the World.png|300px|thumb|Rapid transit networks around the world:

Many places call their rapid transit system a metro. Other words for rapid transit, which vary around the world, are subway, underground, tube, elevated, or heavy rail. These words sometimes describe how the system is built: some systems are completely below or above ground, while others may have both below-ground and above-ground sections.

A single rapid transit system can have many lines that go different places and many stations where people can get on and off trains, and sometimes change between other forms of public transport. These lines often have stations where people can change from one line to another to go in a different direction. These kinds of stations are called interchange stations, and many of the biggest rapid transit systems have several of these stations.

Nanga Parbat, located in Gilgit-Baltistan, is the ninth highest mountain in the world. It is 8,126 metres (26,660 ft) above sea level.  It is in Gilgit Baltistan, between Chilas and Astore. Nanga Parbat means "Naked Mountain". In 1953, an Austrian German named Hermann Buhl was the first to climb it.

Nanga Parbat is in the west of the Himalayas, and is the most western of the mountains higher than eight thousand meters. It lies just south of the Indus River, in the Astore District of the Northern Areas in the region of Kashmir. Not far to the north is the western end of the Karakoram mountains.

Nanga Parbat is the highest peak in the Nanga Parbat Range. The range covers an area of 120 in length and 12 in width. In the east it joins the Pir Panjal Range.

The steep incline of its peak that rises above the ground far below makes Nanga Parbat a difficult and dangerous climb. Many deaths in the mid and early 20th century gave it the nickname of "killer mountain".

[[K2]]

CATEGORIES: Karakoram, Mountains of China, Mountains of Pakistan, Gilgit-Baltistan, Xinjiang

K2 is the second highest mountain in the world, at 8611. It is also known as Mount Godwin-Austen or Chhogori. K2 is part of the Karakoram range. It is located partly in China and partly in Pakistan but India also claims it due to the Kashmir conflict. The name K2 came from the first survey of Karakoram. At that time, the surveyors gave each mountain a simple label of "K" followed by a number.

K2 is known as the Savage Mountain as it is very hard to climb. It is considered to be harder to climb than Mount Everest. K2 has the second-highest fatality rate among the eight-thousand-metre mountains. One person dies for every four who reach the top. As of 2011, only 300 people have climbed to the top of the mountain. At least 80 people have died trying to climb it. K2 has never been climbed during the winter.

The summit was first reached in 1954, by Italian climbers Lino Lacedelli and Achille Compagnoni.

[[Respiration]]

CATEGORIES: Metabolism, Cellular respiration

Respiration is the process in which nutrients are converted into useful energy in a cell. During respiration, energy is released in a form that can be used by cells. All living things respire. Both plant and animal cells use the process of respiration to release energy from glucose.

There are two types of respiration. One is aerobic respiration and the other is anaerobic respiration. This type of respiration occurs in the presence of oxygen Here oxygen is utilised to break down the food (glucose) to release high amount of energy this is called aerobic respiration. This type of respiration occurs in the absence of oxygen. During respiration in yeast and bacteria, oxygen is not involved in the oxidation of food. Food (glucose) is broken down into ethyl alcohol and carbon dioxide this is called anaerobic respiration. 

Some use oxygen to break down glucose completely into CO2 (Carbon dioxide) and H2O (Water).

[[Roman Republic]]

CATEGORIES: Roman Republic, 509 BC establishments, Former countries in Europe, Former republics

The Roman Republic was a phase in history of the Ancient Roman civilization. According to legend, the city of Rome was founded by Romulus in 750 BC. It was a kingdom until 510 BC, when the last King, Lucius Tarquinius Superbus was overthrown. This began the Roman Republic. 

The Roman Republic was a civilization ahead of its time and very advanced. The Roman people elected Consuls, who ruled for about a year. Many of the ideas of the Roman Republic are still used today.

The Republic got most of its wealth from trading and taxation.  The Republic had few enemies but it was constantly on war with the Gauls, who were conquered by Caesar later.  The Punic Wars against Carthage were fought all over the Mediterranean coasts, mainly because of Sicily and trade disputes.  The third enemy being the Germanic tribes or simply barbarians (uncivilized people).

The Republic suffered many disasters including Spartacus (the leader of a slave revolt) Spartacus defeated one consul's army before being captured, the Republic suffered at the hands of Hannibal, who after crossing the Alps defeated the Roman Army at Cannae and many other battles which saw Rome with a great fear of being destroyed by Hannibal.

The end of the Republic is still a matter of dispute; different scholars will give different dates for it. Usually, the dates of the start of the First Triumvirate or the Second Triumvirate are given. (The Triumvirates were groups of three men who had much power)

The end of the Republic is often said to be when Gaius Julius Caesar was appointed as dictator (single ruler) by the Roman Senate. This happened after a series of civil wars that lasted from about 49 BC to the year 44 BC.

Some people say the Republic ended with the naval Battle of Actium between Marcus Antonius and Octavian. They both had been in the Second Triumvirate. It was fought on 2 September 31 BC. Octavian won. Later on, he was proclaimed Roman Emperor. The end date could also be when Octavian was given the title of the first Augustus by the Senate. This was on 16 January 27 BC.

These are modern views though. In the view of the early emperors, the Res Publica (Republic, literally "Thing of the People") still existed. It was simply "under their protection". They promised that some day that the Republic would restored to its original form. This never happened, and so scholars divide the Roman Empire and the Roman Republic as two different, distinct periods of the history of Rome.   

[[First Triumvirate]]

CATEGORIES: Ancient Rome

The First Triumvirate is the name most historians give to the political alliance between Gaius Julius Caesar, Marcus Licinius Crassus and Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus (Pompey). They made it in 60 BC to give each other power. Each person helped the others to be more powerful. 

Caesar was able to gain money from Crassus to finance his public works campaign. He also gained military power from Pompey's loyal legions. Crassus, who was much envied and hated for his wealth and the means he used to attain it, was also able to gain popularity from Pompey as well as Caesar who had a loyal following in the plebeian class. Pompey was grateful to Caesar for his support against slander in the senate. Caesar's speeches in the senate were in favor of giving the newly conquered land to Pompey's returned legions. Pompey and Crassus ended their old grudge that dated back to the Third Servile War because they realised the advantages they allowed each other. To cement the Triumvirate, Crassus told Caesar's numerous debt holders that he would pay Caesar's loans if Caesar defaulted. Pompey married Caesar's only child, Julia. The Triumvirate lasted until Crassus' death in the Battle of Carrhae in 53 BC.

Caesar and Pompey started fighting. Caesar won at the Battle of Pharsalus. Caesar became dictator in the year 44 BC.

[[Second Triumvirate]]

CATEGORIES: Roman Republic

The Second Triumvirate was an alliance between Octavian, Mark Antony and Lepidus. It was formed to punish the conspirators who assassinated Julius Caesar. 

The Triumvirate lasted from 43 BC to 33 BC. It ended the effort by Marcus Tullius Cicero to make the Senate once again the top body of the Republic. From then on Rome was ruled by an Emperor.

The Triumvirate army, led by Octavian and Mark Antony, defeated the Conspirators' army led by Cassius and Brutus.  The war ended with the Battle of Philippi in Roman Macedonia in 42 BC.  Cassius and Brutus committed suicide and the remainder of their army joined the Triumvirate forces.

[[Shetland]]

CATEGORIES: Shetland, Counties of Scotland, Scottish Council Areas

Shetland (or the Shetland Islands) is an archipelago, the furthest out part of Scotland in the United Kingdom.

The islands are between the Faroe Islands and the Orkney Islands. They are about 50 miles to the northeast of the Orkney Islands. They are about 100 islands in the group. People live on 16 of them.

The islands form part of the boundary between the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the North Sea to the east.

The largest islands of the group are Mainland, Yell, Unst, Fetlar, Whalsay, and Bressay. In general, the climate of the group is subarctic, and rather bleak. 

They used to be called Hjaltland or Zetland. Today, the islands are part of Scotland. The administrative centre is Lerwick.

The economy of the islands is largely based on agriculture. The sheep are known for their fine wool. Other well-known exports are the Shetland ponies and Shetland Sheepdog.

In 1969 crude oil was discovered near the islands, leading to an alternative source of income for them.

[[Salt evaporation pond]]

CATEGORIES: Geology, Ponds

A Salt evaporation pond (or saltern pond) is a man-made shallow pond. Usually it is located near the sea. The ponds can be filled with salt water. The water is then left to evaporate. The salt is left behind, and can be harvested. Such ponds also provide a habitat for several kinds of animals. Most of these animals are birds. 

The color tells how much salt there is left in the water. Green colors come from special algae. These algae are there in low to mid salinity ponds (ponds with little salt in the water). In middle to high salinity ponds, an alga called Dunaliella salina shifts the color to red. Millions of tiny brine shrimp create an orange cast in mid-salinity ponds. Other bacteria such as Stichococcus also contribute tints. These colors are especially interesting to airplane passengers or astronauts passing above due to their somewhat artistic formations of shape and color. 

[[Salinity]]

CATEGORIES: Oceanography

Salinity is a scientific term. Scientists use it to tell how much salt there is in water. Salinity is measured by the amount of sodium chloride found in 1,000 grams of water, if there is 1 gram of sodium chloride in 1,000 grams of water solution it is 1 part per thousand. This is written as 1‰.

[[Food preservation]]

CATEGORIES: Food preservation

Food preservation is about the ways and means which help to preserve food. Food spoils from bacteria if it is not treated.  For thousands of years, humans have used methods of preserving food, so that they can store food to eat later. The simplest methods of preserving food, such as drying strips of fish or meat in the hot sun have been used for thousands of years, and they are still used today by indigenous peoples. The other ancient method is to use salt, and often drying and salting are done together. 

Food is spoiled because microorganisms change it.  There are five basic techniques which make food last longer:

Usually several of the techniques are combined.

[[Adenosine triphosphate]]

CATEGORIES: Cellular respiration

Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is a chemical. All living things make ATP to store energy and to move it to the cells that need it. An ATP molecule is like an oil barrel that stores and transports fuel. Cells get all of their energy from ATP. They break ATP molecules apart to use the stored energy. The harder a cell works, the more ATP it needs.

[[Shrimp]]

CATEGORIES: Decapods, Seafood

Shrimp refers to small, decapod crustacea. Shrimp are mainly found in three groups: Caridea, Procarididea, and Dendrobranchiata. There are thousands of species, and usually there is a species adapted to any particular habitat. Any small crustacean which resembles a shrimp tends to be called one.

Adult shrimp are filter feeding benthic animals that live close to the bottom. They can live in schools and can swim rapidly backwards. They have a high tolerance to toxins in polluted areas, and may contribute to high toxin levels in their predators. They play important roles in the food chain and are important food sources for larger animals from fish to whales.

Shrimp are related to prawns. In cooking, the criterion is often only the size of the animal (prawns are bigger). Biologically, prawns and shrimp can be told apart by the structure of their gills. In prawns, the gills are branching; in shrimp they are not.

[[Prawn]]

CATEGORIES: Decapods

Dendrobranchiata is a suborder of decapod crustaceans, and contains shrimp and prawn.

Dendrobranchiata are commercially fished and are used for cooking. The difference between prawns and shrimp is usually that prawns are larger than shrimps. Prawns are crustaceans similar in appearance to shrimps, but they can be distinguished by the gill structure which branches out in prawns but not in shrimps. Prawns are also related to crabs and lobsters. Prawns have two pairs of antennae.

Prawns are found in calmer waters were the they can nest in water plants to lay their eggs. Like shrimps, prawns tend to prefer warmer waters in the tropics but some species of prawn are found in the Northern Hemisphere.

Prawns eat by filtering nutritious particles out of the water flowing around the prawn. Therefore, prawns are found near rocks or close to the sea floor.

Prawns are a common source of food for humans around the world, particularly in areas where the prawn exists naturally such as South-East Asia.

[[Crab]]

CATEGORIES: Crabs

Crabs are a form of decapods (having eight walking legs and two grasping claws), along with lobsters, crayfish and shrimps. Crabs form an order within the decapods, called the Brachyura. Their short body is covered by a thick exoskeleton.

They are an extremely successful group, found all over the world. They are basically heavily armoured shell-breakers. Most crabs live in sea-water, but there are some who live in fresh water, and some who live on land. The smallest are the size of a pea; the largest (the Japanese spider crab) grows to a leg span of 4 metres. About 7,000 species are known.

Decades later, Panama also became independent from Colombia.

[[Nail (anatomy)]]

CATEGORIES: Limbs and extremities, Integumentary system

A nail is a hard part of the body at the tip of the fingers and toes, of which most people have ten. Toenails and fingernails are similar, except that toenails grow four times more slowly. Only certain mammals have nails: mostly, they are found in primates. They are made of the same kind of material (keratin) as the claws of other animals.

Like hair, nails never stop growing. They must be cut from time to time. It does not hurt when people cut their nails as they are not innervated.  The nails are made up of a protein called keratin which also makes up the main element of hair and skin. People paint their nails to make themselves look more attractive, usually females. On occasion nails can grow into the skin acting as a nidus of infection known as an ingrowing nail. They can hurt, so are often treated through medicine. The cutting and painting of the nails is called a manicure.

[[Crustacean]]

CATEGORIES: Crustaceans

The Crustacea are a subphylum of arthropods with 67,000 described species. They are part of the phylum Arthropoda. Crustaceans include crabs, lobsters, crayfish, shrimp, krill and barnacles. They are relatives of insects. If the Arthropods are regarded as a superphylum, then the insects and crustacea would be phyla (see List of animal phyla). The group has an extensive fossil record, reaching back to the Cambrian.

Most crustaceans are aquatic, mostly marine. Some have moved onto land permanently. Crustaceans that live on land include some crabs, and woodlice. Crustacea range in size from a parasite 0.1mm long, to the  Japanese spider crab with a leg span of up to 14 ft (4.3 m) and a mass of 44 lb (20 kg). The North Atlantic lobster can weigh more than 40 pounds.

Most crustaceans are mobile, but some become sessile after their larval stage. Barnacles are crustacea which become attached to rocks on the sea shore. Some are parasitic, like  fish lice, and tongue worms. Crustacea usually have separate sexes, however some are hermaphroditic. Their eggs eventually hatch into larvae.

Crustaceans are a subphylum in the phylum Arthropoda, so they have a tough exoskeleton, a series of jointed appendages, and a segmented body. Crustaceans have three major body parts. They are, front to back: head, thorax, and abdomen. They have two pairs of antennae, and two eyes. The mouth has two mandibles. Most breathe with gills, although sime land crabs have developed lungs. Lobsters and crabs have hard outer skeletons (exoskeleton), and tend to preserve well as fossils. As adults, they moult their shells as they grow in size.

Most large crustaceans crawl along the bottoms of streams, rivers, and the ocean, sometimes coming on land. Because they move along the ground under the water, they are called benthic creatures. Even though lobsters and shrimps can swim a bit, they usually walk along the bottom of the body of water in which they live.

More than 10 million tons of crustaceans are produced by fishery or farming for human consumption, most of it is shrimps and prawns. Krill and copepods are not as widely fished, but they have the greatest animal  biomass on the planet, and form a vital part of the food chain.

Maria Montessori was an Italian educator and doctor. She was born on 31 August 1870 in Chiaravalle, Italy. 

Maria Montessori created the first Montessori school. It was a method of education which respected the natural development of the child. Its main feature was to allow as much independence as possible to the individual child. Another feature was to allow mixed ages in the same classroom. This was different from the formal classroom teaching used even for young children at the time. Maria Montessori started this method when she was in charge of a school for handicapped children. Maria Montessori also founded around 1907 in San Lorenzo, a slum area of Rome, the first Casa dei Bambini ("Children's House"). She died on May 6, 1952.

Jacob de Gheyn III is a famous painting.

It was painted by Rembrandt in 1632 and is the most stolen painting in the world. It has been stolen and recovered from galleries  at least four times, making it the world's most stolen painting.

Every time the painting has been recovered anonymously and as a consequence nobody was accused of the theft. This painting by Rembrandt is so well known that it would be difficult for a thief to take it again.

Jacob de Gheyn III, also known as Jacob III de Gheyn (1596–1641), was a Dutch Golden Age engraver, son of Jacob de Gheyn II, canon of Utrecht (city), and the subject of a 1632 oil painting by Rembrandt. The portrait is half of a pair of pendent portraits. The other piece is a portrait of de Gheyn's friend Maurits Huygens, wearing similar clothing (ruffs and black doublets) and facing the opposite direction

As legend goes, a man by the name of Marcus Smith V was found in a gallery sneaking and slowly making his way toward the painting with intent to steal it. The ghost of Jacob de Gheyn III sneaked up behind him and killed him. the legend is most likely untrue because Smith was with a lover that night and was actually poisoned the next night.

[[Wart]]

CATEGORIES: Diseases caused by viruses

Warts are growths on the skin. Very often they resemble solid blisters. Usually, applying pressure to a wart causes pain. Warts are caused by viruses in the HPV family. As there are many types of viruses in the HPV family, there are also many types of wart. In most cases, warts are not dangerous, but may cause a lot of pain.

The virus infects skin cells; if these skin cells move to other areas, new warts can grow there. Warts contain tissue that bleeds easily. A bleeding of this tissue allows the wart to spread to other places. In general, coming in contact with infected tissue spreads the infection.

There are different ways of getting rid of a wart:

As a waiter in his father's cafe, he began writing songs "to escape the mundanity of it all". Chart success was followed by adulation, touring, drug use, confusion, tuberculosis and, in the early 1970s, Islam's changed outlook and an album called Tea For The Tillerman.

Stevens nearly drowned in an accident in Malibu in 1975.  Stevens described the event in a VH1 interview some years later: "I suddenly held myself and I said, 'Oh God! If you save me, I'll work for you.'" He had looked into Buddhism; Zen and I Ching, numerology, tarot cards and astrology", but when his brother David gave him a copy of the Qu'ran, Stevens began to convert to Islam.

In 1977 he changed his name to Yusuf Islam upon becoming a Muslim. He stopped playing and recording pop music for almost 30 years, but started performing again in 2006.

He lives with his family in London, England.

[[National Party of Australia]]

CATEGORIES: National Party of Australia, 1920 establishments, 1920s establishments in Australia

The National Party of Australia is the third biggest political party in Australia. It was first called the Country Party when it started in 1920 and then became the National Country Party in 1975. In 1982 it became the National Party.

The National Party represents the interests of people who live in rural areas, that is, not in big cities. It normally joins together with the Liberal Party to form a coalition government. It has fewer people in Parliament than the Liberal Party. The current leader is Warren Truss. When the National Party is in a coalition government its leader is usually the Deputy Prime Minister.

The Party was quite powerful during the 1940s, 1950's and 1960s. Because it worked closely with the United Australia and later Liberal Party, three National leaders - Earle Page, Arthur Fadden and John McEwen - were Prime Minister for a short time. The Party is strongest in Queensland, where it has had several State Premiers. In 2008, the Liberal Party and National Party came together in Queensland and are now called the "Liberal National Party of Queensland".

The party's federal parliamentary leader since 2021 is Barnaby Joyce. He replaced Michael McCormack following a leadership spill.

[[Oil well]]

CATEGORIES: Fuel

An oil well is a well to get petroleum from the ground.  People in the petroleum industry look for a place that might have oil.  They drill a hole deep in the ground and, if the oil is there, then pump it up from the hole.  Most oil is very deep underground.

Oil wells can be classified by purpose: 

Active wells can also be categorized as:

Wells may be straight holes, or directionally drilled:

[[Prairie]]

CATEGORIES: Grasslands

A prairie is a type of habitat with mostly grasses, but also flowering plants and occasional shrubs or isolated trees.  This type of habitat can be found around the world, but it goes by different names, such as steppes in Asia. What tourist attract is the golden grass in Prairie grassland.  The word prairie generally means grasslands in North America.  There are often many animals on a prairie, that either prefer a prairie or can only live in a prairie. Some that are well known are the American bison (also called the buffalo) and the pronghorn antelope. Birds include the bobolink and meadowlark.

[[Mall]]

CATEGORIES: Malls

A mall or shopping centre is a large building that is full of many smaller shops and stores. It is different from earlier markets or bazaars because most of the shops are not little booths or stalls in one big open area. Each store has its own space with walls. Most of their entrances face a central walking area inside the building.

[[Ice skating]]

CATEGORIES: Skating

Ice skating is skating on ice as a sport, entertainment or pastime. Ice skates, a special type of boot with metal blades on the bottom, are worn to skate on ice. Figure skating and speed skating are the sport forms of ice skating. Hockey is also played on ice, with players wearing ice skates. The International Skating Union (ISU) is the international governing body for figure skating and speed skating.

[[Rink]]

[[Trading post]]

CATEGORIES: Commerce, Trade

A trading post is a place where trade takes place. The path to a trading post, or between trading posts, is known as a trade route. 

Trading posts were common places in Canada and the United States when they were both new countries. People used trading posts to trade fur and other things. 

Trading posts are also used in many campsites across the United States and Canada as places to buy snacks and other things.

The clerk was in charge of a trading post and a fur trader owned the trading post.

[[Wasp]]

CATEGORIES: Wasps

Wasps are members of the order Hymenoptera, which also includes ants, bees and sawflies. 

The common or garden wasps, Vespula vulgaris, and hornets (Vespa) are members of the eusocial family Vespidae. This has about 5000 species.

By far the greater number of wasp species (over 100,000) are the parasitic wasps. Most of them are parasitoids which lay their eggs in the caterpillars of other insect species. Almost every pest insect species has at least one wasp species that preys upon it or parasitizes it. This makes wasps vital to the natural control of pest numbers (biocontrol). Parasitic wasps are increasingly used in agricultural pest control as they prey mostly on pest insects and have little impact on crops.

[[Human papillomavirus]]

CATEGORIES: Viruses, Sexually transmitted diseases

The Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a virus that can infect the skin or mucous membranes (like the genitals, or inside the mouth) of humans. They cause warts. Some of them may cause cancer. There are over 100 different virus types in this group. About 40 virus types can be transmitted sexually. About 12-15 can cause cancer. 

Most cases of HPV can be prevented by a vaccine, which also would stop the HPV from causing cancer.  Most cases of cervical, oral and throat cancer are caused by HPV.

A first step in treatment is the use of salicylic acid. This is available in pharmacies, usually without a prescription. If this does not help, the wart can be frozen, and destroyed that way, or a laser can be used to destroy it. If this still does not help, different methods of chemotherapy can be used.

[[Salicylic acid]]

CATEGORIES: Acids

Salicylic acid is a chemical substance. It is an acid. It is the base ingredient for a drug called aspirin. It is also used as a food preservative, and to treat diseases of the skin, like acne or warts. It is also used in shampoos to treat dandruff (flaking skin on the head).

[[Shampoo]]

CATEGORIES: Hygiene

Shampoo is a  beauty care product. It is used to remove natural oils from hair. It is like liquid soap, but it is made to wash hair. It is sold in stores, and many people use it to make their hair clean. After people use shampoo, they might use a conditioner, which makes the hair soft. Together they have a good effect on a person's hair. The people who make shampoo try to make it smell nice. They also try to make the shampoo healthier.

In addition to shampoo for hair, there are body shampoos made to wash an entire body.

[[Transparency]]

CATEGORIES: Optics

In optics, transparency is the property of allowing light to pass through something.  

An object that is transparent can be seen through.  That is, what is on the other side of the object can be seen through it.  The image you can see through a transparent object is similar to the image you can see without it.  It may be changed if the transparent object behaves like a lens.  This could change the size or shape of the image. The opposite of transparency is opacity.

Some animals are transparent, so predators cannot see them so easily. An example of a transparent animal is the jellyfish. Transparency works better in places with a small amount of light than in places with lots of light.

[[Punjab region]]

CATEGORIES: Regions of Pakistan, Regions of India

Punjab is a region in South Asia. It is divided by the Radcliffe Line: Some parts of it are in the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, and others are in the Republic of India. It is in a plain, with the River Indus flowing through the western part, which is in Pakistan. The soil is very fertile. It lives from agriculture. Main religions in the region are Islam, Sikhism and Hinduism.

[[Hepatitis]]

CATEGORIES: Diseases caused by viruses, Liver disease

Hepatitis is a disease of the liver. In hepatitis, the liver is inflamed. There can be several reasons why the liver is inflamed. For this reason there are several kinds of hepatitis. The most common forms are Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C. Most cases of Hepatitis are caused by viruses. Some forms are caused by bacteria, fungi or parasites. The bacteria that cause tuberculosis or syphilis can also cause hepatitis; so can the parasite that causes malaria. 

Hepatitis can also be caused by alcohol. About one in four people who drink more than three alcoholic drinks a day (over a period of 10–15 days) will have some form of hepatitis caused by alcohol.

Various drugs and chemicals can also cause hepatitis, most notably paracetamol (overdose), yellow phosphorous, and others. Hepatitis may also be caused by other diseases.

[[Rodeo]]

CATEGORIES: Equestrian sports

A rodeo is a North American sport. It is a collection of several similar activities that came from the history of the day-to-day lives of Mexican vaqueros (cowboys) and American cowboys. It has events that came from the handling of cattle, and the riding and training of horses. Rodeos started as a competition between the cowboys to see who was the best. Over time it has gone from taking a collection of money for the person who won to today's large professional competitions such as the National Finals Rodeo with a lot of money for the winners.

[[Dewey Decimal System]]

CATEGORIES: Books

The Dewey Decimal System is a way to put books in order by subject. It is often used in public libraries and schools in the United States and other countries. It places the books on the shelf by subject using numbers from 000 to 999. It is called "decimal" because it uses numbers to the right of the decimal point for more detail (e.g. 944.1 for History of Brittany). Each subject has its own group of numbers. The system was created by Melvil Dewey in 1876. It is also called the Dewey Decimal Classification. The classification has been changed many times. The latest change is number 23 in 2011. There is also a smaller one for small libraries called "Abridged Dewey". 

Each subject is broken up into 10 smaller, more specific categories.

Here is a list of some sections in it:

[[Rhombus]]

CATEGORIES: Polygons

A rhombus is a parallelogram with all sides equal in length. A rhombus with all angles equal is called a square. The word rhombus comes from the Greek word rhombos, meaning "spinning top". A  rhombus is sometimes called a diamond, but not all rhombi are diamond shaped.

To find the perimeter of a rhombus, just add up all the sides. Also opposite sides are parallel and opposite angles are equal. Another interesting thing is that the diagonals (dashed lines in second figure) meet in the middle at a right angle.

[[Change (money)]]

CATEGORIES: Money

Change is the money returned after paying for something with more money than it costs. For example, if someone buys a 25-pence sweet bar with 1 pound (100 pence), they will get 75 pence back.

Change can also mean any kind of money in coin form. To have exact change means to have the exact cost of the item. In the United States, buses require people riding the bus to have exact change. The bus does not give money back. They must pay exactly what the cost is, they can not pay more.

[[Homework]]

CATEGORIES: Learning, Education

Homework, or a homework assignment, is a set of tasks assigned to students by their teachers to be completed outside the classroom. Common homework assignments may include required reading, a writing or typing project, mathematical exercises to be completed, information to be read before a test, or other skills to be practiced.  

The effects of homework are debated. Generally speaking, homework does not help young children. Homework may help older students, especially low-achieving students. However, homework also creates stress for students and parents, and reduces the amount of time that students can spend in other activities. 

Homework dates back to the 1900s, though it may have existed from earlier.  

[[Garlic]]

CATEGORIES: Herbs, Allium

Garlic (species Allium sativum) is a type of plant that people eat for food. Garlic is related to onions, shallots, and leeks. It has a very strong flavor and smell. Most of the time, people use it as a flavoring so that it helps make food taste better.

Garlic is used as herbal medicine in the treatment of cold and flu.  It has side effects of heartburn, flatulence and sweating.

The part of the garlic plant that people eat is called the head.  It grows at the bottom of a long green stalk.  People pull the head apart into smaller pieces called cloves of garlic.  Cloves have papery skin on them.  People peel off the skin before cooking the cloves.

People plant garlic in the fall right after the first frost.  They plant the clove like a seed.  One clove can grow into a whole head.  The garlic plant grows its roots before the ground freezes for winter.  People harvest (collect) the garlic in the middle of the next summer.

[[Glaze]]

CATEGORIES: Pottery

Glaze is a layer or coating used on pottery or ceramics. It may be called vitreous enamel or porcelain enamel. Powdered glass is fused onto ceramics by firing to between 750 and 850 °C (1,380 and 1,560 °F). The powder melts, flows, and then hardens to a smooth, lasting vitreous coating on metal, or on glass or ceramics. This is done in a kiln. 

There are many different types of glaze, some are used for decoration and some are used to make pottery watertight so it can hold liquids. Glaze serves to colour, decorate, strengthen or waterproof an item.

Glazing is important for earthenware vessels as otherwise they would leak water. Glaze is also used on stoneware and porcelain. In addition to the functional aspect of glazes, they can form a variety of surface finishes, including degrees of gloss and matte and colour. Glazes may also enhance an underlying design or texture. 

Glaze is used on building materials. The Iron Pagoda, built in 1049 in Kaifeng, China, of glazed bricks is an example.

Ceramic glaze raw materials generally include silica, which forms glass when fired. Metal oxides, such as sodium, potassium and calcium, act as a "flux" to lower the melting temperature. Alumina, often derived from clay, stiffens the molten glaze to prevent it from running off the piece. Colour comes from iron oxide, copper carbonate or cobalt carbonate. Tin oxide or zirconium oxide make the glaze opaque.

[[Nuclear]]

[[Tungsten]]

CATEGORIES: Chemical elements, Metals, Transition metals

Tungsten (sometimes named wolfram) is a chemical element on the periodic table. It has the chemical symbol W and it has the atomic number 74. It is a steel-gray to white colored metal. In chemistry, it is placed in a group of metal elements named the transition metals. Tungsten is found in several ores, including wolframite and scheelite.

Tungsten has a higher melting point than any other non-alloy that exists. The pure form (only tungsten) is mainly used in electrical equipment. Its compounds and alloys are used for many things, the most well known being its use in electrical filaments for light bulbs.  It is also used in the filament and target in most X-ray tubes, superalloys, and in glass-to-metal seals.

Tungsten's density and hardness have many uses. In the military, for example, tungsten has been used in armor-piercing artillery.

Tungsten's density is almost the same as gold. Gold-plated tungsten ingots have been fraudulently passed off as solid gold.

[[Arc]]

CATEGORIES: Geometry

An arc is a part of a circle. An arc is a curved line. The curve of an arc is constant and does not change (that is, an arc has constant curvature). It sometimes is portrayed as a dotted line.

[[Particulate]]

CATEGORIES: Materials

Particulates are very tiny pieces of a solid or liquid that are carried floating in a gas.  When the tiny pieces are solid, it is called a smoke.  When the tiny pieces are liquid, it is called an aerosol. Aerosols can be naturally found in clouds and geysers. There are also artificial aerosols such as haze and some air pollutants. Smokes can be found naturally in wildfires and volcanoes. Artificially, they can be found in cigarettes, factories and power plants. Both of them can cause air pollution and climate change.

CATEGORIES: Writing systems

Shorthand or stenography is a way of writing. Shorthand systems allow people to write much faster. Shorthand systems have been in use since antiquity. Now, they are not used as much, because there are dictation machines to record voices.

[[Sine wave]]

CATEGORIES: Wave physics

A sine wave is a curve, a continuous function with this shape: 

This is a picture of a sine wave.

All waves can be made by adding up sine waves. The sine wave has a pattern that repeats. The length of this repeating piece of the sine wave is called the wavelength. The wavelength can be found by measuring the length or distance between one peak of a sine wave and the next peak. The wavelength can be found in many other ways too. 

[[Collingwood Football Club]]

CATEGORIES: Australian Football League

Collingwood Football Club, the Magpies, is a club which plays Australian Rules Football in the AFL. It comes from Collingwood, a suburb of Melbourne in Victoria. In the AFL/VFL, it has won 15 premierships.

[[Vibration]]

CATEGORIES: Mechanics, Mechanical vibrations, Sound, Earthquake engineering

Vibration means quickly moving back and forth (or up and down) about a point of equilibrium. The vibration may be periodic (having a pattern) or random. Something that is vibrating may shake at the same time.  If it vibrates in a regular way, it may produce a musical note because it can make the air vibrate. This vibration will send sound waves to the ear and to the brain.

In structural engineering including earthquake engineering, vibrations may be bad. They may cause the structure to fail.

The time it takes a vibrating object to go back and forth completely is the period. The number of back-and-forth movements in one second is its frequency, measured in Hertz (Hz). The farthest possible distance from the equilibrium point is the amplitude.

[[Molybdenum]]

CATEGORIES: Chemical elements, Metals, Transition metals

Molybdenum is a chemical element. It has the chemical symbol Mo. It has the atomic number 42. It has 35 isotopes. The name Molybdenum is from the Greek meaning "leadlike". The color of pure molybdenum is silvery-white. It does not occur naturally, and is made from molybdenite.

[[Solution]]

CATEGORIES: Chemistry

In chemistry, a solution is a homogeneous mixture  of two or more substances.  The substances that are dissolved are called solutes. The substance the solutes are dissolved in is called the solvent. An example from everyday experience is a solid like salt or sugar (which are crystalline solids), dissolved in a liquid (like water).  Gases can dissolve in liquids.  An example is carbon dioxide or oxygen in water. Liquids may dissolve in other liquids and gases in other gases.

The amount of solute added to the solvent determines the concentration of the solution. The solution with the large amount of solute is called a concentrated solution; the solution with less solute is called a dilute solution.

Examples of solid solutions are alloys and some minerals. For example, brass is an alloy of copper and zinc.

[[Insurance]]

CATEGORIES: Insurance

Insurance is a term in law and economics. It is something people buy to protect themselves from losing money.  People who buy insurance pay a "premium" (often paid every month) and promise to be careful (a "duty of care"). In exchange for this, if something bad happens to the person or thing that is insured, the company that sold the insurance will pay the money back. (However, there are some times when the company will not have to pay the money back, such as if the person was not careful.)

[[Bunsen burner]]

CATEGORIES: Laboratory equipment

A Bunsen burner is a common piece of laboratory equipment. It is commonly used for heating chemical substances, sterilization, and combustion. It works by burning flammable gas. It is named after Robert Wilhelm Bunsen, a German chemist. He made important improvements on an earlier burner invented by Michael Faraday. 

The Bunsen burner can be adjusted to make a flame that is very hot without making much light. This allows seeing the different colors that various chemicals make when they are sprinkled into the flame.

[[Michael Faraday]]

CATEGORIES: 1791 births, 1867 deaths, English chemists, English physicists, English science writers

Michael Faraday (Newington Butts, Surrey, 22 September 1791 – Hampton Court, Surrey, 25 August 1867) was the son of a blacksmith who became one of the most famous scientists of the 19th century.

He was sent to a local school to learn how to read and write. A local vicar paid for this, seeing his obvious intelligence. Faraday became the greatest experimental physicist of the nineteenth century.

Faraday became a Fellow of the Royal Society, and was awarded the Royal, Copley and Rumford medals of the Society. Although Faraday had only primary school education, and did not know higher mathematics, he became one of the most influential scientists in history. For the most part, he was an autodidact: he taught himself.

At the time when he lived, people like him were called natural philosophers. Then, only a little was known about electricity. Michael Faraday discovered many things about the way electricity flowing in a wire can act like a magnet (now called electromagnetism). He also found out a lot about the way electricity can be used with chemicals to make them change (now called electrochemistry).

He showed that magnetism is able to affect rays of light, as there is an underlying relationship between the two phenomena. His inventions of electromagnetic rotary devices formed the foundation of electric motor technology, and it was largely due to his efforts that electricity became viable for use in technology. He made the first electric motor. It is thanks to his early work that electricity has been made into a useful thing today.

As a chemist, Michael Faraday discovered benzene, invented an early type of Bunsen burner and popularized terminology such as anode, cathode, electrode and ion. Faraday was the first Fullerian Professor of Chemistry at the Royal Institution of Great Britain, a position to which he was appointed for life. He was also the Director of the Royal Institution after Sir Humphrey Davy.

Albert Einstein kept a photograph of Faraday on his study wall alongside pictures of Isaac Newton and James Clerk Maxwell.

[[Robert Bunsen]]

CATEGORIES: German chemists, 1811 births, 1899 deaths

Robert Wilhelm Eberhard Bunsen (30 March 1811 – 16 August 1899) was a German chemist. He improved the bunsen burner which now has his name. It was invented by Michael Faraday. 

Much more important was the work he did which led to spectroscopy. Together with Gustav Kirchhoff, he developed a method of using the spectrum of light to identify the composition of solids,liquids or gases. Spectroscopy originated through the study of visible light dispersed according to its wavelength, for example, by a prism.  Bunsen found the elements caesium and rubidium with his spectroscope. 

In 1841, Bunsen developed the Bunsen cell, by improving the galvanic cell William Grove had developed in 1839.

[[Alimentary canal]]

CATEGORIES: Anatomy of the digestive system, Animal anatomy

Alimentary canal is the term used in zoology for the gut of vertebrates. For humans in particular, see digestive system.

The canal (or tube) carries food through digestion and excretion. Into the tube come various digestive enzymes. Gut flora  help digestion, and the production of vitamins. Muscular movements pass the material down the tube. The gut usually has an exit, the anus, by which the animal disposes of solid wastes. Some small animals have no anus and dispose of solid wastes by other means, for example through the mouth.

Alex Jones (born February 11, 1971) is a radio talk show host from Texas. He is described as conservative politically by a mainstream source. He describes himself as a paleoconservative politically, which means that he advocates old or traditional forms of political conservatives, as opposed to the newer forms, i.e. neoconservatives. He also calls himself an "aggressive constitutionalist". He is a conspiracy theorist.

Jones claims that the USA was responsible for the 9/11 attacks.

Jones is the host of The Alex Jones Show on Genesis Communications Network.

Stuart Fergusson Victor Sutcliffe (23 June 1940 – 10 April 1962) was an early member of the English band The Beatles. He was born in Edinburgh, Scotland and raised in Liverpool, England. He was the band's original bassist, but left before they became famous. He wanted to be an artist, and he returned to art school, which he had quit to join the Beatles.

Sutcliffe died in 1962, at the age of 21, in Hamburg, Germany from a brain hemorrhage. It was long thought that the hemorrhage was from a fight with locals after a concert in 1961, but it is now believed he may have been born with a medical condition which caused it.

[[George Boole]]

CATEGORIES: 1815 births, 1864 deaths, 19th century philosophers, English mathematicians, English philosophers, Boolean algebra

George Boole buːl, (November 2, 1815 – December 8, 1864) was an English mathematician and philosopher. He created Boolean algebra. This is one of the bases of modern-day computer science. Other humans, like Augustus De Morgan and Charles Peirce, refined and completed his work. In their times, very few people knew of the work those mathematicians had done. Boolean algebra was rediscovered by Claude Shannon about 75 years after Boole's death. In his doctoral thesis, Shannon showed that boolean algebra was useful. It could simplify the design of electric switches and relays (like those that were used in the telephone switchboards of the time). Shannon also showed that such switches could solve boolean algebra problems. All modern-day digital circuits (mainly computers) use such algebra to solve problems. 

[[Managua]]

CATEGORIES: Cities in Nicaragua, 1811 establishments in North America, National capitals in North America

Managua has been the capital city of Nicaragua since 1855. There had been an Indian settlement there before the Spanish, but the modern city was founded as Leal Villa de Santiago de Managua in 1811. Before 1855, León and Granada were the capital cities. The word managua comes from the Nahuatl language mana-ahuac. It means near water. About 1.8 million people lived there in 2004. This makes it one of the biggest cities of Central America (after Guatemala City). The city is at the shore of Lake Managua. Many people who live in Managua are White or Mestizo. They all speak Spanish. There are also big communities of Catalonians, Germans, Italians and French. Many of the people belonging to those communities have lived in the city for many generations. Many people see Managua as one of the safest cities in America to live in.

The city has had two destructive earthquakes in the 20th century. Hurricane Mitch caused further destructions in 1998. Many old buildings were damaged or destroyed in these earthquakes, and new streets and monuments were built in their place. In general, addresses are rarely used to give directions. Instead, people usually use monuments to tell where a certain place is. The problem with that approach is that sometimes, the monuments themselves were destroyed. Therefore, foreigners often have problems finding their way around the city.

[[Flat]]

CATEGORIES: Basic English 850 words

Flat might mean:

In music "flat" can have two (related) meanings:

[[Curve]]

CATEGORIES: Geometry

A curve is a line that turns or bends. A curved line is never straight, and a curved surface is a surface that is never flat. Some curves can be drawn on paper, but some curves, like a helix, can only be seen in 3-D. A circle is a curve that can be described with the formula x2 + y2 = r2. x and y are used as in a Cartesian coordinate system, and r is the radius of the circle (distance from the center to the outside). Many other curves can also be described with a formula like that.

[[Möbius strip]]

CATEGORIES: Geometry

The Möbius strip or Möbius band is a looped surface with only one side and only one edge. It can be made using a strip of paper by gluing the two ends together with a half-twist. The twisting is possible in two directions; so there are two different (mirror-image) Möbius strips.

The Mobius strip is known for its unusual properties. A bug crawling along the center line of the loop would go around twice before coming back to its starting point. Cutting along the center line of the loop creates one longer band, not two.  Cutting one third of the way in from the edge (and parallel to it) produces two Möbius strips, looped together.

The Möbius strip was discovered independently by the German mathematicians August Ferdinand Möbius and Johann Benedict Listing in 1858.

[[Klein bottle]]

CATEGORIES: Geometry

The Klein bottle is a geometrical object, named after the German mathematician Felix Klein.  He described it in 1882, and named it Klein'sche Fläche (Klein surface). Like the Möbius strip, it only has one surface. Mathematicians call this a non-orientable surface. Klein bottles only exist in four-dimensional space, but a model of a Klein bottle can be made in 3D. This model is different from the original because at some point the shape touches itself. In 3D, part of the shape is "inside" the rest. This is not the case in 4D. Some 3D models use different colors to show the 4th component. The part that lies "inside"  then has a different color.

Because the surface is non-orientable, there is no "inside" or "outside". This means that if a liquid were filled "in the bottle", it would run down its surface. This may not be true for the 3D models of the bottle.

The 2-dimensional version of a Klein bottle is a Möbius strip.

[[Entropy]]

CATEGORIES: Thermodynamics

The entropy of an object is a measure of the amount of energy which is unavailable to do work. Entropy is also a measure of the number of possible arrangements the atoms in a system can have. In this sense, entropy is a measure of uncertainty or randomness. The higher the entropy of an object, the more uncertain we are about the states of the atoms making up that object because there are more states to decide from. A law of physics says that it takes work to make the entropy of an object or system smaller; without work, entropy can never become smaller – you could say that everything slowly goes to disorder (higher entropy).

The word entropy came from the study of heat and energy in the period 1850 to 1900. Some very useful mathematical ideas about probability calculations emerged from the study of entropy. These ideas are now used in information theory, statistical mechanics, chemistry and other areas of study. 

Entropy is simply a quantitative measure of what the second law of thermodynamics describes: the spreading of energy until it is evenly spread. The meaning of entropy is different in different fields. It can mean:

[[Side]]

[[Te Puke]]

CATEGORIES: Cities in New Zealand

Te Puke is a small town in the Bay of Plenty in New Zealand. 6670 people live there. It is famous for kiwifruit, which is grown there. Lots of other fruit is grown there too.

Te Puke means the hill in Māori.

[[Valley]]

CATEGORIES: Valleys

A valley is a type of landform.  A valley is a lower part in the land that sits between two higher parts which might be hills or mountains.  Valleys often start as a downward fold between two upward folds in the surface of the Earth, and sometimes as a rift valley.  A valley is made deeper by a stream of water or a river as it flows from the high land to the lower land, and into a lake or sea. Some valleys are made by glaciers which are slow-moving rivers of ice.  Water or ice make a valley deeper or wider by erosion.  Wind can also make valleys larger by erosion.

A valley has a "head" where it begins in the mountains or hills, "sides" where it rises up on either side, a "floor" which is where the valley is most flat. Some valleys have an "entrance" where the valley opening can be seen between two hills or mountains or cliffs. A place where a valley is very narrow and has high walls is sometimes called a "gorge". (This word "gorge" is sometimes used to mean the "throat" on a human body). 

Many of the people of the world live in valleys because there is often a river or stream in a valley for fresh water, and there is often good soil in a valley to grow crops.

[[Manifold]]

CATEGORIES: Mathematics

A manifold is a concept from mathematics.  Making a manifold is like making a flat map of a sphere (the Earth).

The Earth is a sphere, a three dimensional object of geometry. Yet, maps (two-dimensional representations) can be made of the Earth. At the edges of a certain map, the map needs to be changed. That way it is possible to make a two dimensional image of the whole surface of the Earth. There need to be rules, on how to change the maps, and some areas (near the edges of the map) will be on more than one map. It is not possible to make one map only, which would have no edges. This map would either have edges (and overlapping areas), or there would be some places where the paper was torn. Tearing and overlapping isn't allowed.

Other shapes can be manifolds too. For example, a hyperbolic plane is a shape that looks like a saddle or leaf of lettuce. If you try to press it down onto a piece of paper, it will have wrinkles, and it will go on forever past the edges of the paper. But you can make a map of part of it by squishing the edges, just like with the Earth you can make a map by taking part of it and stretching the edges.

Each manifold has a dimension. This is the number of dimensions of the maps, in the example above. It is the same for all maps. 

[[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate]]

CATEGORIES: Cellular respiration

NADP (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) (formula C21H29N7O17P3) is a coenzyme that carries electrical energy used in cellular processes. When a hydrogen atom is added, NADP becomes charged and is renamed NADPH. NADP is used extensively during the Krebs (citric acid) cycle and during glycolysis and in the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis.

[[The CW]]

CATEGORIES: American television networks, Columbia Broadcasting System, Time Warner, 2006 establishments in the United States

The CW Television Network (The CW) is a television network in the United States launched at the beginning of the 2006–2007 television season. It is a joint venture between CBS Corporation, the former owner of United Paramount Network (UPN), and Time Warner's Warner Bros., former majority owner of The WB Television Network. The "CW" name is derived from the first letter of the names of these corporations (CBS and Warner Bros.). According to its former President of Entertainment Dawn Ostroff, the network tries to "appeal to people 18 to 34-years-old". The network currently airs programming six days a week: Monday through Friday afternoons and evenings (in prime time), and Saturday morning children's programming (under their The CW4Kids block).

The network started after its two predecessors, UPN and The WB, ceased independent operations on September 15 and September 17, 2006 respectively. The CW's first two nights of programming—Monday and Tuesday, September 18 and September 19, 2006—consisted of reruns and launch-related specials. The CW marked its formal launch date on Wednesday, September 20, 2006, with a two-hour season premiere of America's Next Top Model.

The CW offers a mixture of programming that originated on both UPN and The WB along with its own original programs, mostly targeted towards women and young adults.

[[Borzoi]]

CATEGORIES: Dog breeds

Borzoi is a type of Russian dog. It used to be called a Russian Wolf Hound.

This breed of dog was brought to the United States in 1889. It was approved by the American Kennel Club one year later.  The breed is beautiful and has a gentle personality. It makes it a good pet.

The breed was approved and the descriptive standard was written in 1650. It has not changed much since then.  It is about 30 tall at the withers (its back near the shoulders). It weighs from 75.  Borzois have a long coat. They can be any color from solid white to brown and white, gray and white or brindle. They can also be all black. People who take care of Borzois have done a good job of stopping health problems. Borzois do not have many of the problems other breeds have with health.

In Russia, they were well liked by the royalty. It was illegal to sell them. They were given to those who did something special for the Tzars.  They feature in Russian novels e.g. in Tolstoy's "Anna Karenina".  During the Russian revolution, most of the breed were killed because they were a symbol of royalty.  A few were taken from the country.

They have been used in advertising for luxury cars and jewelry. This is because of their elegant looks.

[[Edward the Confessor]]

CATEGORIES: 1000s births, 1066 deaths, Christian saints, House of Wessex, People buried in Westminster Abbey

St. Edward the Confessor (circa 1003 – 4 January 1066) was King of England from 8 June 1042 AD to 4 January 1066. After he died, there were four people who claimed the throne. Edward had promised to each of them that they would be king.

Edward spent many years in Normandy. The Anglo-Saxon nobles invited Edward back to England in 1041. He became part of the household of his half-brother Harthacnut. According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle both were sworn in as king together.

Following Harthacnut's death on 8 June 1042, Edward ascended the throne. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle indicates the popularity he enjoyed at his accession — "before he Harthacnut was buried, all the people chose Edward as king in London". Edward was crowned at the cathedral of Winchester, the royal seat of the West Saxons on 3 April 1043.

CATEGORIES: Settlements in Ontario

Gilbertville is a hamlet in Norfolk County, Ontario, Canada that is in between Delhi and the historical hamlet of Pine Grove. There is a small grocery store, a tractor shop, a car repair shop, and farmland to the south. In addition to all this, Gilbertville is also the site of a former army base and was founded by the Gilbert family in the 19th century as a place to rest horses when travelling to and from the towns of Simcoe and Delhi.

[[World War III]]

CATEGORIES: Wars, Eschatology

World War III is the name given to a possible third world war. It refers to a world war that may happen. It would be the successor to World War II (19391945).

A world war might be fought by multiple countries of the world against one other, sometimes across different continents. An all-out war fought between two or three major powers would be a world war.

Because technology and weapons have become so advanced, most people agree that if World War III ever happens, nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons may be used. Biological weapons are living things, usually bacteria or viruses. Chemical weapons might not kill quickly but poison people or their land. Together, nuclear, biological and chemical weapons are called weapons of mass destruction. Conventional weapons, on the other hand are "normal" weapons like guns or non-nuclear bombs. 

Mass destruction could damage much of the Earth and kill many humans and other living things. Albert Einstein is often quoted as having said: "I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones". Einstein might not have actually said this, but other things that he said show that he believed the weapons used in World War III might be so devastating that they would end civilization as we know it.

[[Shotgun]]

CATEGORIES: Shotguns

A shotgun is a type of gun.  To make a shotgun work, gunpowder is lit by a primer inside a shotgun shell.  The gas from the burning gunpowder pushing whatever is being fired out of the barrel.  Originally, a shotgun shell would have small lead balls called "buckshot" or "birdshot". These days instead of lead shot the cartridges have plastic balls, because lead in the environment has bad effects on wildlife. The balls spread out when they are fired. Sometimes a shotgun shell will have bigger shot, of bullet size, called a "slug".

A shotgun usually one or two barrels, each with a chamber to hold a shell. These barrels can be next to each other ('side-by-side') or on top of each other ('over-and-under'). There are many types of shotguns with different ways of loading and shooting. Some will snap open, and shells can be put inside until they are shot again. These are called break-open shotguns. Others hold more shells and are pumped back and forth to shoot. These are called pump-action shotguns. Some shotguns are semi-automatic, so each time the trigger is pulled, one shot is fired without any need to use a pump or a lever. These are semi-automatic shotguns. Some shotguns are fully automatic, meaning that pulling and holding the trigger back will keep shooting the gun without needing to reload until the shotgun is out of ammunition. These are automatic shotguns. However, the last type are uncommon.

Shotguns can also fire things that do not kill people. Police use things like rubber balls and beanbags filled with the small metal balls instead, to cause non-deadly injuries.

[[Mosquito]]

CATEGORIES: Flies, Parasites, Venomous animals

A mosquito is a type of fly. It is the common name of a family of flies in the order Diptera.

The females are ectoparasites: they land on warm-blooded animals, pierce a capillary, and inject saliva to stop the blood coagulating. Then they suck up and eat the blood. Deadly microscopic parasites often live in the saliva.

The males are nectar-feeders, and so are the females. However, in preparation for egg-laying the females turn to blood for its protein.

[[Molasses]]

CATEGORIES: Sweeteners

Molasses (Known as treacle in the United Kingdom if it was made to be eaten by humans) is a by-product of sugar canes or sugar beets being turned into sugar. It is like a thick syrup. Some people also call molasses sorghum syrup. The quality of the molasses depends on how the sugar is refined. Molasses is like a black golden syrup type liquid. 

Molasses is the base for making rum. Sometimes vodka is also made from molasses.

[[Syrup]]

CATEGORIES: Syrup

Syrup is a thick, sweet, flavored liquid with a high sugar content. There are different flavored syrups, such as chocolate syrup, vanilla syrup, and maple syrup. Syrups are used to sweeten and flavor hot and cold drinks, and they are poured on desserts and breakfast foods.

[[Sugarcane]]

CATEGORIES: Poaceae

Sugarcane (or sugar cane) is a genus of plants. There are between 6 and 37 types of sugarcane (how many there are depends on the interpretation of what is a grass and what is not). Sugarcane grows in warm and tropical climates. It first grew in Asia, but after the year 700 people started planting it in Africa and southern Europe. Later it spread to the Americas and Australia. Today the biggest producer is Brazil in South America. India in Asia is second biggest producer after Brazil.

Sugarcane stalks grow to between 2 and 6 meters tall. These stalks contain sugar, which is used to sweeten food and drinks. After the sugar has been taken out the remains of the stalks can be burned to generate heat and electricity. It can also be made into paper, cardboard and cutlery. This crop requires high temperature and high rainfall. In areas of low rainfall this crop is cultivated with the help of irrigation. Black soil or alluvial soil is the best for this crop. Sugarcane requires a large amount of water. That is why holding deep soil is required. As this crop absorbs nutrient matter from the soil, compost manure and chemical fertilizers are used. It wants 75-100cm rainfall.

[[Sugar beet]]

CATEGORIES: Amaranthaceae

Sugar beet is a plant. Its roots contain a high amount of sucrose. This can be made into sugar. Sugar beets are grown for sugar. The sugar beet is related to chard.

The biggest producers of sugar beet are the European Union, the United States and Russia. 30% of the world sugar production is from sugar beets.

[[Tourette syndrome]]

CATEGORIES: Genetic disorders, Syndromes

Tourette syndrome is an inherited neurological disorder. Tourette syndrome can also be called Tourette's syndrome, Tourette's disorder, GTS, Tourette's, or TS. People that have Tourette's have tics (movements or sounds that the person cannot easily control). Tourette's is normally inherited, and starts in childhood. 

People who have Tourette's have a normal life expectancy and normal intelligence. Tics are normally not as bad as people get older. Adults with severe Tourette's are rare. Fewer than 15% of people with Tourette's have coprolalia. Coprolalia is using words or phrases that some people might find offensive without being able to stop saying them. These may include curse words. However the stereotypical Tourette's sufferer has coprolalia.

Most people with Tourette's do not need treatment. There are drugs that can help people manage tics. There are also therapies that can help people live easier with Tourette's.

The disease is named after Georges Gilles de la Tourette. He was one of the first doctors to describe the symptoms.

Also, people who have this syndrome might feel very depressed and have high chance to get depression.

[[Henagon]]

CATEGORIES: Polygons

A henagon (or monogon) is a shape in geometry. It is like a polygon, except that it only has one side and one corner (vertex). Henagons are considered to be impossible to draw, using Euclidean geometry. This is because the single side would go to infinity.

Since it only has one side, there is only one angle. Therefore, all henagons are considered regular shapes.

CATEGORIES: Islands of New York, Geography of New York City

Long Island, NY is the longest island in the United States. Over 7 million people live there. The majority live in the western part, in Brooklyn and Queens which are parts of New York City. The other people live in two counties. Nassau County is in the central area, and Suffolk County fills approximately the eastern half. To the north is Long Island Sound and to the south is the Atlantic Ocean. There are almost 200 Long Island Towns on Long Island, NY. 

The East River separates Long Island from Manhattan island and the Bronx mainland. The Narrows separates it from Staten Island. Long Island is a terminal moraine left by glaciers during the ice ages. 

The 2000 census counted 7,448,618,  people living on Long Island, making it the most populated island in all of the United States, and more populated than Ireland and Jamaica. Long Island is in the eastern time zone.   

The term "Long Island" often refers only to the mostly suburban counties of Nassau and Suffolk because Brooklyn and Queens are part of New York City.

[[International Astronomical Union]]

CATEGORIES: Astronomical organizations, International organizations

The International Astronomical Union (IAU) is an international group that brings together the national astronomical groups from around the world. It was created in 1919. It was created to promote and protect the science of astronomy by getting different nations to work together. Its members are professional astronomers from all over the world, and they all work on research and education in astronomy. The IAU has good relationships with groups that include amateur astronomers. "National Members" are usually people with a high level of professional astronomy. There are more than 10,000 active "Individual Members" in 107 countries. It has 62 "National Members". 

This organization has many working groups like the Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature (WGPSN), which maintains the astronomical naming conventions and planetary nomenclature for planetary bodies, and the Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) for naming stars. 

The IAU is also the group in charge of naming objects in space and anything on them such as mountains and craters.

[[Obfuscation]]

CATEGORIES: Language

Obfuscation means making something harder to understand, usually by complicating sentences needlessly. Weasel words are a form of obfuscation. Obfuscation is usually used when people either do not know what they are talking about or wish to hide their meaning.

Some people say that when doctors use difficult medical words to hide unpleasant things from patients, they are using obfuscation.

Technical term: Obfuscation is sometimes used to make source code much harder to read and reverse engineer.  This can be a significant concern for technology like Java and JavaScript that require source code to be exposed in order to function.

Mjölnir was also a symbol of both fertility and destruction, and was thought to possess regenerative healing powers. 

When thrown, Mjölnir would return to Thor's after hitting its target. 

"... He Thor would be able to strike as firmly as he wanted, whatever his aim, and the hammer would never fail, and if he threw it at something, it would never miss and never fly so far from his hand that it would not find its way back, and when he wanted, it would be so small that it could be carried inside his tunic."

Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District (Леди Макбет Мценского уезда) is an opera by the Russian composer Dmitri Shostakovich.  It is one of the most important Russian operas of the 20th century.  The words for the opera (the “libretto”) were written by Alexander Preis who based them on a story by the Russian writer Nikolai Leskov.  The opera has nothing to do with Shakespeare’s play Macbeth except for the fact that it is about a woman like Lady Macbeth who is tempted to commit a murder.

Wars are sometimes fought over border disputes. Irredentism is often a border dispute.

[[Ambiguity]]

CATEGORIES: Vocabulary, Human communication

Ambiguity means that what a thing is, is not clear. Literally, the word refers to a choice between two different things. In the proper sense it should mean “two different meanings” because “ambi” comes from the Greek word for “two”.

We see things happen, and then we decide what they mean. If we cannot decide what is going on, the event is ambiguous. This is an extension of the original use of the word.

Words or sentences that are ambiguous can lead to misunderstandings (people get the wrong meaning).  This can sometimes be serious, but it can also be funny.  Jokes often rely on ambiguity.

The sentence “The peasants are revolting” is ambiguous because it could mean:

The British comedian Ronnie Barker said that he loved the English language because there are so many jokes you can make using ambiguity.  He gave this example:

A mother says to her little boy: “Johnny, go over the road and see how old Mrs Jones is”.  The boy comes back and says to his mother: “Mrs Jones says it is none of my business”.

The mother meant “old” in a friendly way (“dear old Mrs Jones”), but the sentence could also mean: find out Mrs Jones’s age.  This is obviously how Johnny understood his mother's instruction.

The opposite of ambiguous is unambiguous (meaning that something is perfectly clear and can only have one meaning).

Ambiguity is not the same as vagueness, which means that there is so little detail given that a statement can mean almost anything.

[[Heavy metal music]]

CATEGORIES: Heavy metal, Rock music

Heavy metal is a loud, aggressive style of rock music. The bands who play heavy-metal music usually have one or two guitars, a bass guitar and drums. In some bands, electronic keyboards, organs, or other instruments are used. Heavy metal songs are loud and powerful-sounding, and have strong rhythms that are repeated. There are many different types of heavy metal, some of which are described below.

Common features of heavy metal include slackened (downtuned) instruments and unusual key changes and time signatures (metre).

Heavy metal bands sometimes dress in jeans, leather jackets, and leather boots, and have long hair. Heavy metal bands sometimes behave in a dramatic way when they play their instruments or sing. However, many heavy metal bands do not like to do this.

The German Empire ("Deutsches Reich" or "Deutsches Kaiserreich" in the German language) is the name for a group of German countries from January 18, 1871 to November 9, 1918. This is from the Unification of Germany when Wilhelm I of Prussia was made German Kaiser to when the third Emperor Wilhelm II was removed from power at the end of the First World War. It is sometimes called the "Second Reich".

The name of Germany was "Deutsches Reich" until 1945. "Reich" can mean many things, empire, kingdom, state, "richness" or "wealth". Most members of the Empire were previously members of the North German Confederation. 

At different times, there were three groups of smaller countries, each group was later called a "Reich" by some Germans. The first was the Holy Roman Empire. The second was the German Empire. The third was the Third Reich.

The words "Second Reich" were used for the German Empire by Arthur Moeller van den Bruck, a nationalist writer in the 1920s. He was trying to make a link with the earlier Holy Roman Empire which had once been very strong. Germany had lost the war and was suffering big problems and he wanted to start a "Third Reich" to unite the country. These words were later used by the Nazis to make themselves appear stronger.

[[Journalist]]

CATEGORIES: Journalists

A journalist is a person who works in journalism to report the news. They may work on their own ("freelance") or for a newspaper, a radio or television programme. There are different kinds of journalists.

A reporter is a type of journalist who researches, writes, and reports information. Newspaper reporters write news articles and stories for newspapers. They write these articles and stories by interviewing people, asking questions, and doing research.

Reporters must tell the truth in their reports.  Telling the truth is a very important part of all journalism jobs.  Those who do not tell the truth may be punished like other workers who do not do their work.  They can be suspended (do not work for a short time) or fired (losing their jobs).

However, frequently news reporting does show bias instead of objectivity.

[[Meteor burst communication]]

CATEGORIES: Radio technology, Meteorites

Meteor burst communication uses radio waves which bounce off the ionized trails made by meteors as they enter the earth’s atmosphere.  It is also called Meteor scatter communication.

Meteors are lumps of rock which are floating about in space.  There are always meteors which are entering the earth’s atmosphere.  They normally burn up in the atmosphere.  A few very large ones that hit the earth are called 'meteorites'.  Most meteors are only tiny specks of dust.  As they enter the atmosphere the heat made by air friction rips off electrons.  This produces an ionized trail.  This trail can reflect radio waves in the same way that a wire would.

The meteors that are used for meteor burst communication are between one thousandth and one hundredth of a gram.  Meteors which are smaller than this are too weak to be used.  Larger ones are not frequent enough.

The ionized trail can last for several seconds.  During this time messages can be sent between two radio communication stations.  The messages will be transmitted very fast: about 200 times as fast as with ordinary shortwave radio communication.  A teletypewriter may type several lines of text during a meteor burst. The two stations that want to communicate will have to be ready all the time as they never know when the next burst of communication will come.  They may have to use several meteor bursts before the whole message is received.  The transmitters are often put on buoys in the sea.

Meteor burst communication was first widely used in the 1950s.  It was particularly useful for military communications, because a receiver could not tell exactly which direction the message had come from.  This was because the message was reflected on the way, so it did not travel in a straight line (i.e. in a simple great circle round the earth’s curve).

The use of communications satellites in the late 20th century has made meteor burst communication rare.

[[Spyware]]

CATEGORIES: Spyware

Spyware is a category of software for computers. Spyware is malware that collects some data, usually without the computer users' knowledge. Very often, this data is then sent over the internet to someone else.  Very often, this is used for marketing.  Spyware can also be used to steal data from computers.  One kind is a keylogger which can see whatever you are typing.  Keyloggers can steal important information like passwords that you type. 

The best protection is to get a program that protects against spyware. But be careful, many websites that claim to have them are actually spyware, not something to protect against it. This method of installing spyware is called a Trojan horse which is disguised as something useful but when it runs, its keystroke logging sees what keys you press. This makes it easy for the trojan operator to collect your passwords and important data and log into your accounts. Spyware tracks your computer and uses some of the things on it. This includes your files, your downloads, and usernames/passwords for websites and programs

There are spyware applications that are designed to enable users to spy on themselves rather than others. This is called myware. The term myware has mainly been applied to software applications in three areas: social networking, marketing and time tracking.

[[Vector space]]

CATEGORIES: Linear algebra, Vectors

More formally, a vector space is a special combination of a group and a field. The elements of the group are called vectors, and the elements of the field are called scalars. Vector spaces are important in an area of mathematics called linear algebra, an area which deals with linear functions (functions of straight lines, not curves). 

A vector can be represented graphically with an arrow that has a tail and a head. To add two vectors, you place the end of one vector at the head of the other one (see figure). The sum is the vector that goes from the tail of the first vector to the head of the second. 

Scalar multiplication means that one vector is made bigger or smaller (it is "scaled"). Scalars are just numbers: if you multiply a vector by 2, you make it twice as long. If you multiply it by 1/2, you make it half as long.

The "vectors" don't have to be vectors in the sense of things that have magnitude and direction. For example, they could be functions, matrices or simply numbers. If they obey the axioms of a vector space (a list of properties a vector space needs to satisfy), you can think of them as vectors and the theorems of linear algebra will still apply to them.

There are some combinations of vectors that are special. A minimum set of vectors that—through some combination of addition and multiplication—can reach any point in the vector space is called a basis (of that vector space). It is true that every vector space has a basis. It is also true that all bases of any one vector space have the same number of vectors in them. This is called the dimension theorem. We can then define the dimension of a vector space to be the size of its basis.

[[Basis (linear algebra)]]

CATEGORIES: Linear algebra

In linear algebra, a basis is a set of vectors in a given vector space with certain properties:

The dimension of a given vector space is the number of elements of the basis.

[[Resuscitation]]

CATEGORIES: Emergency medicine

Resuscitation is a thing to do in a medical emergency. It is first aid which is given to a person who is unconscious, and where breathing or pulse can not be detected. It is done to make oxygen continues to reach the heart and the brain. That way, a doctor may be able to restart the heart, possibly without damaging the brain.

The most common cause for a stopping heart is a heart attack.

[[Aubergine]]

CATEGORIES: Vegetables, Fruits, Solanum

The aubergine (also called eggplant) is a plant. Its fruit is eaten as a vegetable. The plant is in the nightshade family of plants. It is related to the potato and tomato. Originally it comes from India and Sri Lanka. The Latin/French term aubergine originally derives from the historical city of Vergina (Βεργίνα) in Greece. The aubergine eggplant is estimated to have reached Greek soils around 325 BC after the death of Alexander the Great in Babylon. Discovering this new vegetable during his conquest, Alexander the Great wished to bring it back to his country on his return. After his death, members of his army brought back seeds of the vegetable back to Greece and specifically to the city of Vergina (Βεργίνα). The Latin/French term aubergine  (au·ber·gine) (\ˈō-bər-ˌzhēn\) is estimated around 1505 AD and is coined to Franco-Catalan gastronomist Sergius Rosario Silvestri, co-traveller and close friend to Amerigo Vespucci. Upon arrival to the historical site of Vergina (Βεργινα) and wanting to try the local delicacies, Silvestri came across the plant of aubergine. Not knowing its name, he referred to it as aubergine  (au Bergine or au Vergine) which in French means at Vergina or found at Vergina.

[[Life cycle]]

CATEGORIES: Biology

Life cycle means the stages a living thing goes through during its life.

In some cases the process is slow, and the changes are gradual. Humans have various stages of growth during their lives, such as zygote, embryo, child and adult. The change from a child to an adult is slow and continuous. In many societies it is marked by ceremonies at puberty.

In most insects the transition is sharp and well-defined: egg > larva > pupa > imago (adult).

[[Yucca]]

CATEGORIES: Agavaceae

Yucca is a family of shrubs and trees, related to the agaves. There are between 40 and 50 different kinds of Yucca. All come from the hot and dry places in North and Central America, as well as the Caribbean. 

They have a very special way of pollination. There is an animal, the Yucca moth, which does the pollination. It also lays its eggs in the plant. The larvae will eat some of the seeds, but not all of them.

In many parts of the world, yuccas are grown as ornamental flowers. 

[[Herb]]

CATEGORIES: Herbs

Herbs are plants that are grown either as a food (usually as a condiment), or because they have some use in treating diseases (or making them better), or for spiritual reasons (for example, their smell). Some herbs may act as an aphrodisiac.

The word herb comes from the Latin word herba, meaning grass, green stalks, or blades.  Botanists use the word to mean any plant with soft, succulent tissues.  But many people use the word to mean only herbs with some economic value.

Herbs are small plants that have a fleshy or juicy stem when they are young.  The stems of some herbs develop hard, woody tissue when they grow old.

Most herbs are perennials.  This means that the tops of the plants die each growing season, but the roots remain alive and produce new plants year after year.

Some herbs are annuals.  They live for only one growing season and must be raised from seed each year.

Sir Alexander Fleming (6 August 1881 – 11 March 1955) was a Scottish biologist and pharmacologist. His father Hugh, died at 59 when Alexander was only seven. He is best known for discovering the antibiotic substance penicillin in 1928. He shared  Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1945 for this discovery with Howard Walter Florey and Ernst Boris Chain. His accidental finding of penicillin in the year 1928 marked the start of today's antibiotics.

Fleming was a captain in the Royal Army Medical Corps during World War I. He saw many soldiers die of infection after being wounded, and after the war did research in bacteriology. After accidentally finding penicillin he studied ways to use it. 

Fleming died of a heart attack in London. He was buried in St. Paul's cathedral.

[[Litter box]]

CATEGORIES: Pets

A litter box (sometimes called a sand box, a litter tray or a litter pan) is a place for cats and some other pets to use as a toilet. Litter boxes usually need to be cleaned regularly. Cats, for example, wish to have their box cleaned every two to three days. Some cats create litterboxes in places like playgrounds and sandpits. Litterboxes usually produce bad smells, which can be avoided by special litter. Many people buy a special kind of clay to fill the box, for this reason.

[[Playground]]

CATEGORIES: Toys, Playground equipment

A playground is an area used by children to play in. They usually have equipment such as slides, swings and seesaws for children to play on. They are usually outside, but sometimes they are in a building. Having a playground can enhance your macadam surface and improve your kid’s time in the playground.

The equipment may be made of metal, wood or plastic. The ground beneath the equipment will not be hard in case a child falls. It may be a rubber floor, or there may be woodchips or sand. 

Playgrounds give children a place for physical exercise.  This helps them get and keep physical fitness and be strong and healthy.  Daily exercise reduces the risks of obesity. 

[[Woodstock Festival]]

The Woodstock Music and Art Festival was a rock music festival at Max Yasgur's 600 acre (2.4 km²) dairy farm in the town of Bethel, New York from 15–18 August 1969. It might be the most famous rock concert and festival ever held. For many, it showed the counterculture of the 1960s and the "hippie era". 

Many of the most famous musicians at the time showed up during the rainy weekend, as can be seen in a 1970 movie, Woodstock. Joni Mitchell's song "Woodstock", about the event, also became a major hit song for Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young. In recent years, a number of attempts were made to recreate it, but the original Woodstock festival of 1969 has proven to be legendary.

The festival was called "Woodstock", because the investment group that backed the concert was called "Woodstock Ventures." It was originally planned for Saugerties, and then the Town of Wallkill, in Orange County (not to be confused with the Hamlet of Wallkill, in Ulster county). People in the Town of Wallkill, meaning those on the Town Board, quickly passed a law that required a permit to hold any gathering for over 5,000 people. A permit was applied for, but it was denied because the portable toilets proposed were considered to be inadequate. A Sullivan County farmer named Max Yasgur heard about the festival and the problems and offered his farm in the Town of Bethel. He was paid $10,000 for the three days.

Although all the municipalities were told there would be no more than 50,000, the organizers thought they would get as many as 150,000, and by best counts, there were more than three times that number over the three days. Most did not pay to get in, and the festival lost money as a result. The roads to the concert were jammed with traffic. People left their cars and walked for miles to get to the concert area. The weekend was rainy and overcrowded, and fans shared food, alcoholic drinks, and drugs. Some people who lived there, including those at nearby Camp Ma-Ho-Ge, gave blankets and food to some concert-goers.

After two days of rain, there was deep mud in many places. There was almost no water for washing, and not enough toilets. Many of the concert-goers had brought small tents to sleep in; some of these turned into piles of cloth and mud. Even though this may not have been the most comfortable place, the crowd kept up kindness and good cheer among themselves. As the half-million people in the audience became aware of this, a warm feeling of friendship spread to everyone.

Some of the music stars of Woodstock were The Who and Jimi Hendrix. Because of arguments about getting paid, The Who did not play on the stage until about 4:00 in the morning. One part of The Who's show was the song "See Me, Feel Me", when the sun rose just as lead singer Roger Daltrey started to sing the chorus. When The Who was still playing, Abbie Hoffman jumped on the stage stopping the show, and tried to stir up the crowd with political slogans, but he was knocked off the stage by the guitar of the band's leader, Pete Townshend, to the delight of the audience. At the end of The Who's set, Townshend slammed his guitar into the stage and threw it into the crowd. This helped set up The Who as super-stars, and caused their album Tommy to sell multi-platinum.

Jimi Hendrix had a big show with the songs he played, including a new version of "The Star Spangled Banner". The song caused some disagreements, because the Vietnam War was going on, and the sounds that Hendrix made with his guitar were like the sounds of the violence of the war. Fans remember these two acts as some of the greatest in rock history, although both The Who and Hendrix thought of their performances as not the best.

Woodstock was put on by Michael Lang, Artie Kornfeld, John Roberts and Joel Rosenman. Roberts was the financer, backed by a trust fund; his friend Rosenman, a graduate of Yale Law, was an amateur guitarist. Their friends were Kornfeld, vice-president at Capitol Records, and Michael Lang. Lang was a light-hearted hippie who had owned a head shop, and hoped to build a studio in the Woodstock area to serve singers such as Bob Dylan and Janis Joplin, who had homes nearby. When Lang and Kornfeld told the idea to Rosenman and Roberts, Rosenman got the idea of a rock concert with the same musicians. They picked the slogan "Three Days of Peace and Music". They hired artist Arnold Skolnick to design the artwork for the poster with the bird. It wasn't until years later, after the release of the 3-LP album and the documentary-like movie that the original investors began to recoup their investment.

In 1997, the concert place and 1,400 surrounding acres were bought by Alan Gerry, and have become the Bethel Woods Center for the Arts. It opened on July 1, 2006 with the New York Philharmonic playing. On August 13, 2006, Crosby Stills Nash & Young amazed 16,000 fans at the new Center—exactly 37 years after they played at Woodstock.

[[Phishing]]

CATEGORIES: Internet security

Phishing is a way that criminals get sensitive information (like usernames or passwords). It is a method of social engineering. Very often, phishing is done by electronic mail. This mail appears to come from a bank or other service provider. It usually says that because of some change in the system, the users need to re-enter their usernames/passwords to confirm them. The emails usually have a link to a page that looks almost like that of the real bank. 

Phishing allows criminals to get access to bank accounts, or other accounts like shopping, auction or gaming accounts. It can also be used for identity theft.

Phishing has changed surprisingly little over the lifetime of the Internet, however certain phishing tactics have gotten much more sophisticated. For example, many phishing techniques via email involve spoofing the email address and creating emails that are designed to look just like emails sent from the real company. Not all phishing attempts do this, however. 

Phishing can also be done over text, via instant messaging apps such as Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp, or even through snail mail. If you receive a text from an unknown number that tells you to visit a specific website for any reason, it might be a phishing link.

Phishing grew by 42% in January of 2005: 8,829 E-mails with phishing were sent in December of 2004 but that grew to 12,845 by end of January 2005.

The number of web pages with phishing grew from 1,740 to 2,560 in the same period.

== Filter evasion == 

Some people who do this started using pictures of text to make it harder for anti-phishing filters to see it. This sometimes works because the filters look for words often used in phishing emails/messages. However, people have invented better filters that can still read the text using OCR (optical character recognition).

Some anti-phishing filters can even read cursive, hand-written, upside-down, distorted (for example, wavy or stretched) text, as well as writing on colored backgrounds.

Sir Edward Richard George Heath GBR (9 July 1916 – 17 July 2005), often known as Ted Heath, was a British Conservative politician. He was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1970 until 1974. Heath was also the leader of the Conservative Party from 1965 until 1975.

Heath was educated at Balliol College, Oxford.

In 1937, as a student when he was travelling in Nuremberg, Heath met three of Adolf Hitler's top Nazi leaders Hermann Goering, Joseph Goebbels and Heinrich Himmler. He described Himmler as the most evil man he had ever met. Heath also travelled to Barcelona in Spain in 1938 at the time of the Spanish Civil War. In 1939, Heath went again to Germany, and returned to Britain before the outbreak of World War II.

Heath was a lifelong bachelor. He never married. His sexual orientation was a matter of dispute during his lifetime, and since. There were rumours that he was gay. Heath never spoke about his sexuality.

He was also a classical organist and conductor and a sailor.

In August 2015, ten years after his death, it was claimed that five police forces were investigating Heath about allegations of child sexual abuse. Writing in The Independent, Heath's biographer John Campbell said: "If he had any inclinations that way he would have repressed them; he was too self-controlled and self-contained to do anything that would have risked his career".

[[Raoult's law]]

CATEGORIES: Thermodynamics

Raoult's law states that the vapour pressure of a binary solution containing a non-volatile solute is directly related to the mole fraction of solvent (i.e. volatile) in the solution.

Also, it states that the vapour pressure of each component in a binary solution containing volatile components is directly related to its respective mole fraction in the solution.

Relative going-down of vapour pressure is equal to mole fraction of non volatile and non-electrolytic solute. This is known as Raoult's law.

They may lead to death, depending on the drug used.

[[Kargil War]]

CATEGORIES: Wars involving India, Wars involving Pakistan, 1999 in Asia, 1990s in India, 20th century in Pakistan

Kargil War also called as the Kargil conflict,fn_(I) was an armed conflict between Indian and Pakistani forces. It took place between May and July 1999 in the Kargil district of Kashmir and along the Line of Control. The cause of the war was a series of past events that worsened the already existing Indo-Pak deteriorated relations. India had violated agreements concerning the Kashmir conflict before.In Jammu and Kashmir, the Line of Control resulting from the cease-fire of December 17, 1971, shall be respected by both sides without prejudice to the recognized position of either side. Both sides refrain from the threat of use of force in violation of this Line.''" India's move into Siachen in 1984 was a flagrant violation of this agreement. It had breached the agreement of LOC by perpetuating aggression in Neelum Valley as well and finally in Kargil. To put a stop to India's actions, the Pakistan army went on, although without proper coordination with its government. Pakistan  clearly did not win the war militarily as well as politically and diplomatically. However, confusions still remain to this day as to who won the war but based on military action alone it was a decisive victory for India As India succesfully regained most of the intruded territory and was also succesful in pushing back both pakistani and pakistani based millitants back on the other side of LoC. Pakistani soldiers and Pakistan backed militants got into areas on the Indian side of the Line of Control (LoC) to occupy military posts vacated in the winter. India responded by launching a military and diplomatic offensive to drive out the Pakistani forces.  The Indian Army launched a number of patrols to the area to estimate the extent of the infiltration. The Indian Army recaptured majority of the positions on the Indian side of the LOC with the help of the US within two months of the conflict according to official count, an estimated 75%–80% of the intruded area and nearly all high ground was back under Indian while Pakistan lost all control over the Kargil area due to orders to withdraw from the Kargil area. Fearing large-scale increase in seriousness in the military conflict, the international community, led by the United States, increased diplomatic pressure on Pakistan to withdraw forces from remaining Indian territory. The Pakistani casualties in the war were around 400 while the Indian casualties during the conflict stood at more than 587 soldiers.

The conflict officially came to an end on July 26, with India regaining its earlier hold on Kargil. 

The Kargil war is one of the most recent examples of high-altitude warfare in mountainous terrain.

[[Big Ben]]

CATEGORIES: Buildings and structures in London, Bells

Big Ben is the nickname of a bell that hangs in the clock tower at the northern end of the Houses of Parliament in Westminster, London, England. Officially, the tower itself is called Elizabeth Tower. It was previously known as just the Clock Tower, but was renamed in September 2012 as a tribute to the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II. However, most people, including those that live in London, call the tower "Big Ben" because it is very large.

Designed by Edmund Beckett Denison, the clock took 13 years to build and it was completed in 1859. It has worked continuously since then except for a few months in 1976 when it broke down and had to be fixed.

Big Ben is one of England’s best-known landmarks. Some believe it got its name from Sir Benjamin Hall. The Elizabeth Tower which it is located in has become one of the most prominent symbols of the United Kingdom and is often in the establishing shot of films set in London.

Since August 2017, repair work is being done on the clock, which will take four years. For the safety of those doing this work, Big Ben no longer rings out every hour. It will still be heard on special occasions, such as the New Year and Remembrance Day.

[[Strontium]]

CATEGORIES: Chemical elements, Metals, Alkaline earth metals

Strontium is a chemical element. It has the chemical symbol Sr. It has the atomic number 38. It is a metal. The colour of the metal is silver-white or yellow-silver. The metal is soft, and highly reactive chemically. 

In chemistry it is placed in a group of metal elements named the alkaline earth metals. Strontium has a high chemical reactivity. The metal turns yellow when exposed to air. Strontium has properties similar to those of its two vertical neighbours in the periodic table, calcium and barium. 

It is found naturally in the minerals celestite and strontianite. The 90Sr isotope is present in radioactive fallout and has a half-life of 28.9 years.

Strontium forms salts which make a red flame when they burn. They are used in flares for signalling the position of survivors or shipwrecks and to make the red colour in fireworks.

It is named after the village of Strontian, Scotland.  

[[Alkaline earth metal]]

CATEGORIES: Alkaline earth metals, Periodic table

The alkaline earth metals are the second group of metals on the periodic table. They are related to the Alkali metals, but they do not react as much because they need more energy to remove their two electrons, So they do not have to be stored in petrol. As ions they have a charge of +2a. The alkaline earth metals are mostly silver colored, soft metals, which react readily with halogens and water to form salts, though not as rapidly as some of the alkali metals, to form alkaline hydroxides. many prokatates and hantates can be found in the crust of  these metals.

The alkaline earth metals are: Beryllium (Be), Magnesium (Mg), Calcium (Ca), Strontium (Sr), Barium (Ba), and radium (Ra). 

Beryllium is very brittle metal that is used in gemstones.

Magnesium is used in making steel alloys.

Calcium can be used in dairy products like milk.

Strontium is used for making glass for TVs and to make fireworks red.

Barium is used in fireworks to turn them green.

Radium is a very radioactive metal used in glowing watches.

[[Extraterrestrial life]]

CATEGORIES: Extraterrestrial life

Extraterrestrial life is life that is not from the planet Earth. It is alien life. The word 'Terra' in Latin refers to our planet - Earth. Thus, Extraterrestrial Life refers to the life forms not originating on or from the planet Earth.

It is reasonable to say that planets rather like ours exist, and that life might evolve there also. So far none has been found, though it is possible that life once existed on Mars.

Searches have been made for signals from extraterrestrial life-forms. No signals have been received.

It is not a new idea. Quite a few philosophers have speculated on the existence of other planets like ours, with the idea that what happened here could also happen there. One thing we do know is that many other star systems do have exoplanets.

[[Caliph]]

CATEGORIES: Caliphs

In Arabic, caliph means "a successor to the prophet". This is what leaders of the Islamic faith came to be called. Their rule is called a caliphate.

Some of the early leaders of the Muslim community following Muhammad's (570–632) death called themselves "Khalifat Allah", meaning representative of God. But the other title of "Khalifat rasul Allah", meaning the successor to the prophet of God, became the common title. Some academics write the term as Khalīf.

Caliphs were often also called Amīr al-Mu'minīn (أمير المؤمنين), leader of the Muslims. This title has since been shortened to "emir". It is also found as a personal name in some countries.

After the first four caliphs (Abu Bakr, Umar ibn al-Khattab, Uthman ibn Affan, and Ali ibn Abi Talib), the title was used by the Umayyads, the Abbasids, and the Ottomans, as well as by other dynasties in Southern Pakistan, Spain, Northern Africa, and Egypt. Most historical Muslim rulers simply titled themselves sultans or emirs, and the caliph himself often had very little real authority. The title was not used after the Republic of Turkey abolished the Ottoman caliphate in 1924.

Paul Adrien Maurice Dirac, OM (August 8, 1902 in Bristol – October 20, 1984 in Tallahassee) was an English physicist.

Dirac's father came from the French-speaking part of Switzerland.

Dirac worked out a formulation of quantum mechanics, which includes Erwin Schrödinger's wave mechanics and Werner Heisenberg's matrix mechanics in 1926. In 1928 he found the Dirac equation and he found out that spin in quantum mechanics is an effect of relativity. The Dirac equation allowed Dirac to predict the existence of antimatter, which is the opposite of matter.

In 1933 he won the Nobel Prize in Physics.

Dirac was the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics chair at Cambridge University from 1932 until his retirement in 1969. He was Professor of Physics at Florida State University from 1972 until his death in 1984.

CATEGORIES: English composers, Renaissance composers, English organists, 1505 births, 1585 deaths, Gentlemen of the Chapel Royal

Thomas Tallis (born c.1505; died Greenwich November 23 1585) was the most important English composer of his generation.

We know very little about Tallis’s youth.  He may have started his career as organist at Dover and then Waltham Abbey.  After the Dissolution of the monasteries he had a job at Canterbury Cathedral for a short time. He was soon made a Gentleman of the Chapel Royal. He had a job in the royal household until his death. He worked for four monarchs: Henry VIII, Edward VI, Mary Tudor and Elizabeth I.

Tallis was an organist and composer.  He had to write music for the royal chapels.  He was given the lease of a big house in Kent and a salary of £91 12s a year (12s is 60p in modern money). That was a very good salary in those days.  In 1575, Queen Elizabeth I gave Tallis and William Byrd a licence which meant they were the only people allowed to print and publish music in England (music printing was a very new invention at the time). Tallis owned a house in Greenwich where he died in 1585.

In the early 16th century church music was often very polyphonic. Voices imitated one another and sang different things at the same time. Tallis wrote church music which was much simpler. In a lot of his music the choir sing homophonic music instead of using the older polyphony.  For a short time, during the reign of the Catholic Mary Tudor, polyphonic music was in fashion again.  This was the time when Tallis wrote an antiphon “Gaude gloriosa Dei mater” and a mass musical setting|mass “Puer natus est nobis”.  These two works are once more very complicated polyphonic works.  After that his works become simpler once more, but he was always keen to try out new ideas from the continent of Europe.  He wrote some very fine anthems.  Many of his works are settings of Latin words, but he also made settings of English texts.

One of his works is called Spem in Alium.  The choir divide into forty parts i.e. the choir need at least 40 people to sing it, and each person sings a different line.  It is possible that he wrote it for Queen Elizabeth I’s 40th birthday in 1573, but we cannot be sure.

His Diliges Dominum is a collection of contrapuntal exercises which includes a very famous canon often simply called “Tallis’s canon”.

[[Homophony]]

CATEGORIES: Music theory

Homophony means music in which the voices or instruments sing or play chords (chords are when two or more notes are played together.)  In homophonic music all the choir (sopranos, altos, tenors and basses) are singing the same words at the same time.  There is a tune on top and the lower parts are the accompaniment.  This is what happens in hymn singing. The opposite is polyphony.  Polyphonic writing is more complicated: the choir sing different melodic lines at the same time (see counterpoint).  The terms "homophony" (literally: "one sound")  and "polyphony" (literally: "many sounds") are mostly used for choir music.

In homophonic music it is easy to hear the words that are being sung.  In polyphonic music it is much harder for the listener to understand the words.  Composers often used polyphony when writing music for the mass because everyone knew the words anyway.  Homophonic music became more important when composers started to write operas and madrigals where a story is being told and the words must be heard clearly.

[[Monastery]]

CATEGORIES: Monasteries

Monasteries are places where monks live. Although the word "monastery" is sometimes used for a place where nuns live, nuns usually live in a convent or nunnery.  The word abbey (from the Syriac/Aramaic word abba: father) is also used for a Christian monastery or convent.  The monk in charge of an abbey is called an abbot; the nun in charge of an abbey is an abbess.

Several religions have a system of monasteries. Christian monasteries have a chapel for the monks to worship. Monks are not allowed to marry (celibacy). They are also not allowed to own anything. Everything they use, including their clothes, belongs to the monastery. During the Middle Ages after the Roman Empire was defeated, monasteries were some of the few places where knowledge still existed.

Some monasteries were built in places far away from where other people lived. The monks who live there live very isolated lives, growing their own food and looking after one another.  Other monasteries were in or near towns. Monks do a lot of work in the community, including as teaching, medical care or telling people about God. Few monks live isolated lives nowadays.

[[Biogeography]]

CATEGORIES: Biology, Branches of geography

Biogeography is the study of how species are distributed. It notes where organisms live, and why they are (or are not) found in a certain geographical area.

Biogeography teaches how animals and plants are adapted to the places they live in, and how similar places often have quite different animals and plants.

Between about 1800 to 1855, natural historians made lists of species in various regions of the world. These lists were published as tables in their books. Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace published the idea of evolution by natural selection. They travelled to tropical countries, and wrote about the life in those countries. They said that evolution was the key to understanding geographical distribution.

New species are usually formed by speciation  an earlier species splitting into two. These species may travel to new places. but they may be stopped from travelling by mountains and seas, and by climate. This means that two places with similar climate often have different kinds of animals and plants. For example marsupials, which live in Australia, are very different from the fauna in South America. The species on islands (Hawaii, Galapagos) may be very different to species on mainland continents.

[[Biophysics]]

Entomology is the science of insects. People who study insects are called entomologists. Insects have been studied since prehistoric times, but it was not until as early as the 16th century that insects were scientifically studied.

Some entomologists study how insects are related to each other. Others study how insects live and reproduce because we do not know very much about some kinds of insects. Other entomologists study ways to keep insects away from crops that people use for food. There are billions of unknown species throughout the world and taxonomists categorize the newly found.

Entomologists meet to talk about their study of insects and to share ideas, just as all scientists do.

[[Ethology]]

CATEGORIES: Ethology

Ethology is the scientific study of animal behaviour (U.S. behavior), and a sub-topic of zoology. Ethology overlaps, to some extent, with psychology. Psychology is a social science which studies human behaviour, but many psychologists have done experiments on learning in animals. Ethology studies animal behaviour, but many ethologists have been interested in human behaviour.

[[Henry III of England]]

CATEGORIES: 1207 births, 1272 deaths, House of Plantagenet, 13th century in England

Henry III (1 October 1207–16 November 1272) became King of England in 1216 when he was 9 years old, after the early death of his father King John. He would end up ruling as king for 56 years (though he would only effectively rule for around 45 due to his youth in the first years). He would be married to Eleanor of Provence, who bore him 5 children, for 36 years. During his long reign, Henry's kingdom would experience relative peace and prosperity until he began having trouble with his barons (particularly Simon de Montfort) due to his high handed governing style, which compelled the Barons to impose the Provisions of Oxford limiting royal power in 1258.  

The king's breaking of this agreement with the barons a few years later would lead to a civil war called the Baron's war which pitched the royal family against the rebel barons for 3 years (1264-1267), culminating in De Montfort's death at the unusually bloody Battle of Evesham in 1265 and the royal family being able to sweep up the remnants of the opposition by 1267. However, Henry's most visible mark on history would be due to his interest in architecture and decoration: which made him redevelop certain aspects of Westminster Abbey, improve the Tower of London's defenses (while keeping exotic animals from africa and the artic such as lions, an elephant and a polar bear in it). He would even preside over the reburial of his personal hero Edward the Confessor at the consecration of Westminster Abbey in 1269, which was seen as the greatest personal triumph of his reign. Soon after the consecration of his abbey, the aging Henry would began to see a sharp decline in his health, eventually dying in 1272 at the fairly advanced age of 65, with his eldest son Prince Edward ascending the throne as King Edward I of England. The new king would have his late father reburied in 1290 in Westminster Abbey, where he has laid till modern historians discovered his tomb, which revealed that Henry III was about 5’ 6” tall and had a drooping left eyelid.  

[[Edward I of England]]

CATEGORIES: 1239 births, 1307 deaths, House of Plantagenet, 13th century in England, 1300s in England

Edward I (17 June 1239–7 July 1307), also Longshanks (meaning 'long legs') and the Hammer of the Scots, was a Plantagenet King of England. He became king on 21 November 1272, until his death in 1307. His mother was Queen Eleanor of Provence and his father was King Henry III of England. As a younger man, Edward fought against Simon de Montfort in defence of his father's crown. He went on a Crusade, and his father died as Edward was on his way back. As a ruler, he improved the laws and made Parliament regular, and more important. He conquered Wales, and subdued the Welsh by brutal policies. He was determined to control Scotland through puppet kings and just managed to do it during his lifetime. He expelled the Jewish people from England.

Scotland Yard is the headquarters of the Metropolitan Police in London.  This police force is responsible for the security in Greater London.

New Scotland Yard is in a 20-story office block on Broadway and Victoria Street in Westminster, about 450 metres away from the Houses of Parliament. The famous rotating sign, which is seen on television and in films, is outside the main doors on Broadway.

Founded on 29 September 1829, on a street of Whitehall, Scotland Yard was called "New Scotland Yard" when moved, in November 1890, to the Victoria Embankment, beside the Ministry of Defence. In 1967, New Scotland Yard moved to the present 20-story building at 10 Broadway.

Scotland Yard got its name by its previous location which was on Great Scotland Yard. As the Metropolitan police grew more famous, people started referring to the house as Scotland Yard.

[[2008 Summer Olympics]]

CATEGORIES: 2008 Summer Olympics, 2008 in China

The 2008 Summer Olympics, officially known as the Games of the XXIX Olympiad, were celebrated in Beijing, People's Republic of China from August 8 to August 24. The opening ceremony began at 08:08:08 pm CST (12:08:08 UTC) at the Beijing National Stadium in Beijing, People's Republic of China. During the games, 10,500 athletes competed in 302 events in 28 sports.

The Olympic games were awarded to Beijing after a vote of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) on July 13 2001. The official logo of the games, titled "Dancing Beijing," features a stylised calligraphic character jīng (京, meaning capital), meaning the host city. The mascots of Beijing 2008 are the five Fuwa, each representing both a colour of the Olympic rings and a symbol of Chinese culture. The Olympic slogan, One World, One Dream, calls upon the world to unite in the Olympic spirit. Several new NOCs were also recognised by the IOC.

The Chinese government used the games to promote China as an important and powerful country, and spent a lot of money on building new facilities and transportation systems for the games. The events were held in 37 venues, including 12 newly-built buildings. In 2007, former IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch said that he thinks that the Beijing games will be "the best in Olympic history". Although there was some controversy about having the games in China, the IOC's former president Jacques Rogge said that the IOC has "absolutely no regrets" in choosing Beijing to host the 2008 games.

[[Pierre de Fermat]]

CATEGORIES: French mathematicians, 1601 births, 1665 deaths

Pierre de Fermat (17 August 1601 – 12 January 1665) was a French lawyer at the Parlement of Toulouse, southern France, and a mathematician. Many people see him as the father of modern calculus.

His method of finding the biggest and smallest ordinates of curved lines also makes him a contributor to differential calculus, which was not known at that time. His studies in the theory of numbers give him the rank of the founder of the modern theory. He also made notable contributions to analytic geometry and probability.

He is also famous for making a simple mathematical statement (known as Fermat's Last Theorem) that he said he could prove, but he never wrote down his proof. Mathematicians tried to prove it for hundreds of years before finally managing it. Fermat probably did not really have a proof for this theorem, and only thought he did.

He proposed his principle on light which states that light selects the path which takes least time to travel.This principle was famous as Fermat principle.

[[Gottfried Leibniz]]

Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (also Leibnitz or von Leibniz) 1 July 1 (21 June OS) 1646 – 14 November 1716) was a German intellectual who wrote mostly in French and Latin.

He played an important role in both philosophy and mathematics. He invented calculus independently of Newton, and his notation for derivatives is the one in general use since then. He also invented the binary system, foundation of modern computers.

He was taught law and philosophy. He served as secretary to two major German noble houses: one became the British royal family while he served it. Leibniz played a major role in the European politics and diplomacy of his day.

In philosophy, he is most remembered for optimism. He thought our universe is the best possible one God could have made. He was one of the great 17th century rationalists. René Descartes and Baruch Spinoza are the other two. His philosophy also both looks back to the Scholastic tradition and anticipates modern logic and analysis.

Leibniz also made contributions to physics and technology, and anticipated ideas which surfaced much later in biology, medicine, geology, probability theory, psychology, and information science. He wrote on politics, law, ethics, theology, history, and philology. Sometimes, he even wrote in verse. His contributions are scattered in journals and in tens of thousands of letters and unpublished manuscripts. There is no complete edition of Leibniz's writings, and a complete account of his accomplishments is not yet possible. Leibniz is sometimes known as the last "universal genius".

Leibniz is perhaps most famous for his involvement in development of calculus independent of Isaac Newton and creation of Leibniz Notation which is the standard form of calculus today.

[[Optimism]]

CATEGORIES: Philosophical movements and positions

Optimism is a philosophy and a way of life. Optimists believe that the world is generally a positive place to be in. In the view of an optimist, people and things are good. Many liberal optimists do not believe in original sin. 

Optimism basically looks on the positive side, believing things will work out in the end. When a person is optimistic, it doesn't mean that they never doubt themselves. They might have a bad day or two. They recognize that they can make things better; there is a lesson to be learned from this, and they will move on. 

The opposing theory is called pessimism. Gottfried Leibnitz was a famous optimist. Arthur Schopenhauer is often considered to be a famous pessimist.

Optimism is associated with the idea of a glass looking "half full", instead of looking "Half empty". Optimism is also a habit of looking on the bright side of a situation

[[Pessimism]]

CATEGORIES: Epistemology, Emotions, Philosophical movements and positions

Pessimism is an attitude of mind and a way to look at life. Pessimists believe that generally things are bad, and the world people live in is the worst possible world.

Someone who uses the philosophy is called a pessimist, they are the opposite of an optimist.

An example of pessimism is seeing that a glass of water is "half empty", not "half full".

They believe that Joseph Smith was a prophet who restored the church Jesus Christ set up on earth when he was alive. They teach that they are the only church that has the full gospel. They also believe that the Father, Son and Holy Spirit are three separate individuals, but all have the same purpose. LDS scriptures include the Bible, the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price. Members of the church, often called Mormons, and properly known as Latter-Day Saints are known for being active in missionary work. They also believe in the importance of families.

[[Knight]]

CATEGORIES: Military, Titles

A knight was a professional heavy cavalry soldier in the Middle Ages. They were the top soldiers to the kingdom, and protected it at all costs. Knights worked for lords or nobles, who in exchange would give them land if the knight would fight for them. Knights thought honour was very important, and they had a code of honour called chivalry. They always had a coat of arms, also called a crest.

Knights of the Commonwealth Realms today are named by the Sovereign One of the British orders of knighthood is known as the Order of the British Empire. These knights today are called 'Sir' and then their first name. Many members of nobility are descended from knights. For example: Wijerd Jelckama descended from a knight who died at the siege of Antioch (1199).

Knights were first used in the 4th century in the late Roman armies.needed'' The era of the knights ended in the 16th century as national armies replaced feudal armies. Many knights were recruited as officers in the new armies. Today's officer corps in Western armies began as groups of knights.

Although knights no longer fight as elite warriors, the act of knighting, or being given knighthood by a king or queen, still exists. The most well-known example of knighting today are tapping the shoulders of the person being knighted with the flat side of a sword. People who are alive today who have been given knighthood include Bill Gates, Clint Eastwood, Michael Caine, as well as former U.S. president, the late George H.W. Bush.

[[Kuiper belt]]

CATEGORIES: Solar System, Minor planets

The Kuiper belt is an area of the Solar System beyond the orbit of Neptune (at 30 astronomical units) to 50 AU from the Sun. 

The objects within the Kuiper Belt together with the members of the scattered disk beyond, are together called trans-Neptunian.

Many objects such as dwarf planets in the Kuiper belt are much bigger than the ones in the asteroid belt and are round. At least some Kuiper belt objects are icebound.

The first objects in the Kuiper belt to be found were Pluto and Charon (moon) but the belt was only identified and named in 1992 when more Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) were found. A few thousand have since been discovered and more than 70,000 KBOs over 100 km (62 mi) in diameter are thought to exist. 

[[Mole]]

CATEGORIES: Soricomorphs

Moles are small mammals adapted to a burrowing (under the ground) lifestyle. This lifestyle is called fossorial.

Moles are found in North America, Europe and Asia. They eat insects, larvae or worms. Moles have velvety, soft fur. They have powerful front paws so they can dig. A mole has an extra thumb.

The family includes the shrew moles and the desmans. There are 

three subfamilies, 17 genera and 46 species in total in this very common group of mammals. Moles have poor vision.

The largest type of mole is the Russian desman. The smallest type of mole is the American shrew mole.

[[Scattered disc]]

CATEGORIES: Solar System, Minor planets

The scattered disc (or scattered disk) is a distant part of the solar system. The area has small icy minor planets known as scattered disc objects (SDOs).  The part of the scattered disc closest to the sun is in an area of space called the Kuiper belt. The Oort cloud lies beyond the scattered disc. The first SDO was found in 1995 by Spacewatch.

The scattered disk is still not understood well. Astronomers believe that it was created when objects in the Kuiper belt were "scattered" by the gravity of the outer planets, mainly Neptune. Unlike most objects in the Solar System which move in a round and flat path, scattered disc objects go every which way. Different SDOs have different orbital eccentricity and orbital inclination. 

[[Flatworm]]

CATEGORIES: Flatworms

Flatworms (Platyhelminthes, Greek "platy"': flat; "helminth": worm) are a phylum of invertebrates. They are relatively simple animals. They have soft bodies. 

With about 25,000 known species, they are the largest phylum of animals without a body cavity.  Flatworms can be found in marine, freshwater, and even damp terrestrial environments. 

A troublesome terrestrial example is the New Zealand flatworm, Arthurdendyus triangulatus.  It is an invasive species which colonized large areas of Ireland and Scotland. It was brought there by accident in the 1960s. Since then, it has destroyed most of the indigenous earthworms.

Most free-living flatworms found in Britain are very small ranging from 5mm to less than 1 cm. They are usually black and can easily be mistaken for debris. These are mostly found in freshwater rivers or streams and are of the Turbellaria class.

Most flatworms (over 50%) are parasitic on other animals. There are four classes: 

and 

Flatworms are one of the invertebrate groups which are studied in school biology. The main reason for this is that they may infect humans, pets and farmyard animals. Some do enormous harm to humans and their livestock. Schistosomiasis, caused by one genus of trematodes, is the second most devastating of all human diseases caused by parasites, surpassed only by malaria.  Effective treatments are now available for these infections. Also, in first-world countries, regulations on domestic cattle prevent infected meat from reaching the human hosts.

[[Trematode]]

CATEGORIES: Flatworms, Parasites

The Trematodes are a class of flatworms in the phylum Platyhelminthes. They are called flukes, and are internal parasites of molluscs and vertebrates. Most trematodes have a complex life cycle with at least two hosts. The primary host, where the flukes sexually reproduce, is a vertebrate. The intermediate host, which is the agent of dispersal, is usually a snail.

The trematodes or flukes are estimated to include 18,000 to 24,000 species

[[Period instruments]]

CATEGORIES: Musical instruments

The period instruments are musical instruments which have been made in the same way they were made hundreds of years ago. This is done so that earlier music will sound like it did when it was first composed.

Musical instruments have changed a lot during the last few centuries.  Composers like Johann Sebastian Bach (1685-1750) wrote music for instruments which sounded differently from the way they do today.  Although most of the orchestral instruments we use nowadays were already in use in Bach’s day, instrument makers have made changes to them.  These changes often gave the instruments a bigger sound so that they could be heard well in large concert halls.  Orchestras also have increased in size.

During the 20th century musicians started to realize that the way we play the music of Bach and other composers was making the music sound different from how it would have been first heard.  People became interested in hearing what the music would have sounded like back in the 17th and early 18th centuries (the Baroque period). Few of the old instruments still existed and many that had survived had been “modernized”.  So instrument makers started to make instruments in the old ways.  Some musicians and orchestras started to play these instruments.  The instruments are often called “period instruments” (or "authentic instruments" or "historical instruments") because they are made so that they are like instruments of earlier periods.

[[Monogenea]]

Arnold Johannes Wilhelm Sommerfeld (December 5, 1868 in Königsberg, East Prussia – April 26, 1951 in Munich) was a German mathematician and theoretical physicist.

Sommerfeld was the son of a practical physician. After finishing school in 1886, he started studying mathematics at the University of Königsberg.

In 1891 he wrote his doctorate thesis about arbitrary functions in mathematical physics.

Afterwards he had to do his army serve.

Then he went to Göttingen. He became assistant at the institute for mineralogy, but was still interested in mathematical physics.

In 1894 he became assistant of Felix Klein. The year after he wrote his habilitation about the mathematical theory of optical diffraction and became docent for mathematics in Göttingen.

In 1897 Sommerfeld married. In the same year he became ordinary professor for mathematics at the mining college of Clausthal. Three years later he got a professorship at the Technical University of Aachen.

In 1906 he became professor for theoretical physics in Munich, were he stood for his lifetime.

While he was professor in Munich, he travelled two times around the world - in 1922/23 he was guest professor in Wisconsin and travelled afterwards through India, China and Japan, in 1928/29 he made a journey through the USA as teacher on universities. 

In 1935 he went in pension, but he still worked until 1940.

There was big trouble about choosing the person who should follow him. Sommerfeld wanted to have Werner Heisenberg on his seat, but in the time of the Nazi regime the job could only go to a person who taught the so-called German Physics, which included a kind of mysticism. Sommerfeld tried to prevent that.

Sommerfeld died in 1951 in a traffic accident.

Maxwell grew up in a rich religious family. In 1845, when he was only 14, he wrote a paper describing a way of drawing mathematical curves with a piece of string. In 1847 he started studying mathematics at the University of Edinburgh. In 1850 Maxwell changed to Peterhouse and then Trinity College at the University of Cambridge. He won prizes from the university for his work and was given his degree in 1854. From 1855 to 1872 he did research on colour blindness.

In 1856 Maxwell was made a professor of 'Natural Philosophy' (which is what science was called then) at Marischal College, Aberdeen. He worked there until the two colleges in Aberdeen joined together in 1860 and he lost his job. He then became a professor at King's College London. In 1861 he was elected to the Royal Society.

In 1871, became the first Cavendish Professor of Physics at Cambridge. He studied many things, but is known best for his mathematical work on electromagnetism and on the behaviour of gases.

He lived at Glenlair House, his family estate near the village of Parton, Castle Douglas in Kirkcudbrightshire. Maxwell died in 1879 from cancer, and is buried in the graveyard at Parton Church.

[[Penicillin]]

CATEGORIES: Antibiotics

Penicillin is a common antibiotic, used to treat bacterial infections. It was one of the first to be discovered, and worked well against staphylococci and streptococci. Many strains of bacteria are now resistant. Chemists keep changing part of its structure in the effort to keep it working against the bacteria.

Penicillin was discovered by Scottish scientist Sir Alexander Fleming in 1928, but it was not mass-produced until  1940. The antibiotic is naturally produced by fungi of the genus Penicillium. There is now a whole group of antibiotics derived from Penicillium including penicillin G, procaine penicillin, benzathine penicillin, and penicillin V.

Penicillin is sometimes used to treat syphilis, tonsillitis, meningitis, and pneumonia as well as other diseases. It was first used widely during World War II.

Penicillin was discovered when Fleming noticed a mold that was stopping bacteria from growing in a petri dish.  Australian scientist Howard Walter Florey made the penicillin mold into a medicine. Together with another scientist Ernst Boris Chain, Fleming and Florey were given the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 1945.

Some people are allergic to penicillin. Symptoms include nausea, diarrhea, or rash. Rarely, patients who are allergic to penicillin get a fever, vomit, or have serious skin irritation.  Because it is such a popular antibiotic, penicillin is the most common cause of serious allergic reactions to a drug. They are now used regularly in hospitals.

[[Depleted uranium]]

CATEGORIES: Nuclear physics

Depleted uranium is what is left over after uranium is enriched. Enriched uranium has enough uranium-235 to be used in nuclear reactors or nuclear weapons. Depleted uranium is made up mostly of the isotope uranium-238. Uranium-238 is mildly radioactive. Uranium is very dense, or heavy for its size. Because of this, depleted uranium is used in armor piercing bullets and heavy machine guns. Its high density allows weapons to put more energy into a fired bullet which causes more damage to its targets. Bullets made from it will burn when they hit something hard, and their smoke is dangerous to breathe. 

Depleted uranium has long been been used in nuclear reactors to make plutonium for producing nuclear energy. In 2010 a new kind of "traveling wave reactor" was proposed to use it more directly.

[[Commuting]]

CATEGORIES: Everyday life, Transport

Commuting is the act of travelling from home to a workplace every day. A commuter is a person who commutes. This was uncommon until the 19th century, when the word was invented for people who used public transport daily. For many commuters, home is a suburb and work is in the inner city; but the reverse is sometimes the case and is called a reverse commute. Commuters may use other transport, such as cars or bicycles.

[[Anne Redpath]]

CATEGORIES: 1895 births, 1965 deaths, Scottish painters

Anne Redpath (1895-1965) was a Scottish artist. She was born in Galashiels, Scotland.

She was the daughter of a tweed designer. Her father's work had an effect on her use of colour and texture in her paintings. "I do with a spot of red or yellow in a harmony of grey, what my father did in his tweed", she said. She went to France during 1920&ndash1933.

[[CD-RW]]

CATEGORIES: Compact Disc

A CD-RW (which stands for Compact Disc ReWritable) is a Compact disc that can be recorded and erased multiple times. It can hold data or music. Most of the time it will hold data, since many CD players can not play CD-RWs. During its development, the format was known as CD-E, which stands for Compact Disc Erasable. The standard was introduced in 1997. It replaced the less successful CD-MO.

The disk used for this is an optical disc. Phase change technology is used to write to the disk. A laser beam is used to heat a certain point of the disk. Once this point is hot, the information stored there can be changed.

According to what the manufacturers of these disks say, it is possible to record and erase such a disk up to 1000 times. They behave very much like CD-Rs, otherwise. Entire sessions can be written. As long as there is space on the disc, new sessions can be appended. To be readable in an ordinary CD drive, all sessions must be closed though.

CD-RWs never gained the popularity of CD-Rs. This is because they are more expensive to make and to buy. Also, not all CD drives can read them. Reading and writing speeds are also lower than those of pre-made CDs and CD-Rs.

Also, like with the CD-R, it is impractical (and slow) to use these disks to quickly add or remove small files. Other formats, like Zip disk, Jaz disk, Magneto-optical disks, and USB flash drives are More used for quickly reading, writing, or erasing small (sets of) files. When a deletion needs to be made, the whole CD needs to be erased.

CD-RWs (like CD-Rs) are more used for backups.  They are usually cheaper than tape-based solutions.

Depending on the method used to write, and the type of disk used, usable capacities range from about 500 to 700 megabytes.

Pretty much the same concepts are used for DVD-RWs, which have a much higher capacity.

[[Magneto-optical drive]]

CATEGORIES: Storage devices

A Magneto-optical drive is a disk drive for computers. It can read and write data to magneto-optical disks. The technology was made at the end of the 1980s. Both 5.25" and 3.5" media exist. The disks look like CD-ROMs, but they are protected with a plastic cover. The MiniDisc is a Magneto-optical disk. The other disks look similar but have a bigger physical size.

[[MiniDisc]]

CATEGORIES: Audio disc

A MiniDisc (MD) is a small magneto-optical disk. It is used as a replacement for the Audio cassette. It was developed by Sony to store music. Later it was modified, so it can also store data. The music it stores is compressed in some way, like an MP3. Recent Hi-MD models have the option to not compress audio, and offer audio identical to CD-quality. 

MiniDisc recorders allow the user to modify the contents of (recordable) disks. That way, tracks can be split, combined or rearranged. Audio tracks can be input while a live recording is in progress, too, for example, while recording a live concert or interview via the microphone input on a MiniDisc recorder.

[[Bottle cap]]

CATEGORIES: Bottle caps, Tools

Bottle caps are used to seal the opening of bottles. For glass bottles, these are usually small, specially adapted pieces of metal. With plastic bottles, plastic caps are used instead. 

The original bottle cap was called Crown cork. It is pressed onto the bottle, and can be removed, using a bottle opener.

In recent years bottle caps with screw on mounts are used that way, a bottle opener is no longer required.

[[Quality]]

CATEGORIES: Characteristics

Quality is how good something is. If the quality of a product is high then that means that it is fit for its purpose. If the quality of an item is low that means that the product may break easily or not work properly. When people say something is a quality product that means that the product is of good quality. Usually higher-quality products cost more money, because the materials used to make them are better, or the way they were made was more effective. In other words, things that are low quality are cheap.

Quality is understood differently by different people, depending on what they consider quality to be. Generally, though, it is how well a product is suited to the purpose it was made for.

[[Gargoyle]]

CATEGORIES: Statues, Architecture

A Gargoyle is a grotesque statue that is attached to a building. It is carved out of stone, usually granite. It is used to get water away from the building when it rains. Gargoyles are often made to look like animals or people. The collected water comes out of their mouths. Most gargoyles were made a long time ago. People used to believe that they scared away evil spirits. Many cathedrals have gargoyles.

New buildings use rain gutters instead of gargoyles to move water. There are not many gargoyles in America.

Gargoyles are often confused with grotesques. They are similar, but only gargoyles get rid of rainwater through their mouths.

[[Assault rifle]]

CATEGORIES: Assault rifles

An assault rifle is a rifle that has a removable magazine, automatic-fire and semi-automatic modes, and uses intermediate cartridges. These cartridges do not have as much power as other rifles’, like hunting rifles or battle rifles, but have more power and penetration than pistol cartridges fired by sub-machine guns.

Two rifles made in Italy and Russia before World War I are sometimes called assault rifles. The Germans were the first to use assault rifles in large numbers. 

Examples of an 'assault rifle' are the English L85, Russian AK-47, the American M16.

The term “assault rifle” comes from the firearm Sturmgewehr 44 (StG 44), translated to “Assault Rifle 1944”. The armed forces of other sovereign states adopted assault rifles later.

When Anne's father died in 1476 Anne became very rich. She also became Countess of Norfolk. Anne was married to Richard of York on 15 January, 1478 in Westminster Abbey. Richard was the son of King Edward IV of England and Elizabeth Woodville. Richard's father had married him to Anne so that he could have control of her fortune. When he married Anne became known as the Duchess of York

Anne died when she was 8 years old at Greenwich, London, England in 1481. Her body was placed in a lead coffin in the Chapel of St Erasmus of Formiae in Westminster Abbey. However, when this chapel was knocked down around 1502 to make room for the Henry VII Lady Chapel, Anne's coffin became lost.

In December 1964, construction workers in Stepney, London, accidentally found Anne's coffin. It was opened and Anne's remains were looked at by scientists. Anne's body still had a shroud wrapped around her and there was still red hair on her skull. Her body was later reburied in Westminster Abbey.

Alfred Charles Kinsey (June 23, 1894  August 25, 1956) was an American biologist. He was born in Hoboken, New Jersey.

In the first part of his career he was an entomologist specializing in gall wasps of the family Cynipidae. Later, he became famous for the research he did on human sexuality. His research had a great influence on social and cultural values in many parts of the world. It also had an influence on the sexual revolution of the 1960s and 70s.

Kinsey and his co-workers wrote two books which became known as the Kinsey Reports. They were based on thousands of interviews with men (first report), and then women. The aim was to find out how widespread or differentiated human sexual practices were. He developed the Kinsey Scale to measure sexual orientation. On one end of the scale, at the value 0, the individual is entirely heterosexual. On the other end, at value 6, he or she has a purely homosexual orientation. Kinsey was bisexual.

Kinsey died of heart disease and pneumonia in Bloomington, Indiana.

A biopic of him, Kinsey, was released in 2004.

[[Francium]]

CATEGORIES: Chemical elements, Alkali metals

Francium is a chemical element with the chemical symbol Fr and an atomic number of 87.  It is a metal.  In chemistry it is placed in a group of metal elements named the alkali metals.  Francium is very radioactive.  It is in very small amounts in uranium and thorium ores.  It has the lowest electronegativity and electron affinity of all the chemical elements.

Francium reacts violently with water, as do all of the elements in group 1 on the periodic table.

Francium is one of the hardest to find elements on the planet Earth.  It is estimated that there are only about 15 grams or half an ounce in the Earth's crust at a single time.

Although chemists knew the element number 87 in the periodic table should exist, it was a long time before it was discovered.  In the early 1900s, nearly all boxes on the periodic table had been filled. Chemists knew that one element had been found to fit into each box. Francium was discovered in 1939 by a French chemist called Marguerite Perey. She named it after her home country, France.

[[Rhenium]]

[[The Cunning Little Vixen]]

CATEGORIES: 1920s operas, Brno, Compositions by Leoš Janáček, 1924 works

The Cunning Little Vixen (original title: Příhody lišky bystroušky, literally translates to The Adventures of Vixen Sharp-Ears) is an opera by the Czech composer Leoš Janáček.  Janáček loved animals, and in this opera some of the characters are humans but some are animals.  Some of the little animals, (like the grasshopper, frog and cricket) are usually sung by children.

Janáček got the idea of this opera from a cartoon strip called “Sharp-ears” (in Czech: "Bystrouška").  The cartoon was published in a popular daily newspaper Lidové noviny.  It was about a vixen (a female fox) and her adventures in the forest.  He thought that the story would make a good opera.  He made a few changes to the story: he left out a some characters, changed the order of the story a little, and made the humans and the animals behave in a similar way.  It was first performed in Brno on 6 November 1924.

When Janáček died in 1928 the last part of the opera was played at his funeral.

[[Tonsillitis]]

CATEGORIES: Infectious diseases

Tonsillitis is a disease. It is also known as pharyngitis, laryngitis and Tonsillar infection. Tonsillitis is caused by either a virus or bacteria. It is the inflammation and infection of the tonsils. The tonsils are in the back of the throat. The tonsils get inflamed and red. Other symptoms include headaches, fevers, back and neck aches, chills, bad breath, weak voice, fatigue, having trouble swallowing, and more. There are treatments for tonsillitis. One treatment is antibiotics. Medicines to relieve pain like Tylenol and Advil are also suggested. The tonsils may be removed surgically if it is medically necessary. This operation is called a tonsillectomy. It is the most effective way to get rid of the infection. All kinds of tonsillitis are contagious. Tonsillitis is spread by human contact.

In 2013, encephalitis killed about 77,000 people in the world.

[[Mitosis]]

CATEGORIES: Cell biology, Plant anatomy

Mitosis is a part of the cycle of cell division. The chromosomes of a cell are copied to make two identical sets of chromosomes, and the cell nucleus divides into two identical nuclei.

Before mitosis, the cell creates an identical set of its own genetic information – this is called replication. The genetic information is in the DNA of the chromosomes. At the beginning of mitosis the chromosomes wind up and become visible with a light microscope. The chromosomes are now two chromatids joined at the centromere. Since the two chromatids are identical to each other, they are called sister chromatids.

Mitosis happens in all types of dividing cells in the human body except with sperm and ova. The sperm and ova are gametes or sex cells. The gametes are produced by a different division method called meiosis.

[[Inflammation]]

Inflammation is the first reaction of the immune system to an infection or irritation. It is an attempt of the immune system to dispel invaders and repair the body. It can happen in many parts of the body and often involves the following five steps:

The first four of these reactions have been known for a long time, since antiquity. Finding them is attributed to Celsus. The last one was added by Rudolf Virchow in 1858.

There are two types of inflammation: acute and chronic. Acute inflammations are more intense but short-lived, while chronic inflammations are less intense but long-lived. Examples of acute inflammation include skin disorders (e.g., psoriasis, dandruff) and arthritis, while chronic inflammation can be responsible for diseases such as cancer, heart disease, type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer's disease. Adoption of healthy diet, physical exercise and rest are some of the ways to reduce Inflammations.

[[Stradivarius]]

CATEGORIES: String instruments

A Stradivarius is a string instrument (such as a violin) built by the 17th century  Italian luthier Stradivari family (especially by Antonio Stradivari) that was famous for making them. Stradivarii are known for their high quality sound and ability to last a long time without tuning. Most of these instruments survive to this day, though few have been stolen. They are some of the best and most expensive instruments, and even each string instrument created has a name. So many people have wanted Stradivarii, and some have sold for more than a million dollars. Famous violinists, such as Midori Goto or Joshua Bell have Stradivarii.

[[Gadolinium]]

CATEGORIES: Chemical elements, Lanthanides, Metals

Gadolinium is a chemical element.  It has the chemical symbol Gd.  It has the atomic number 64.  It is part of a group of chemical elements in the periodic table named the Lanthanides.  It is a rare earth element.  It is silvery white, malleable and ductile.

Its main uses are as chemical compounds in color televisions and nuclear magnetic resonance radio contrast agents.  In color cathode ray tube televisions (the type first produced, not flat televisions) some of the pixels are dots gadolinium compounds. When the electrons from the cathode ray tube hit the  pixels and transfer energy to the gadolinium compounds they give out light as energy.  Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging is used in medicine where it is named MRI (Magnetic resonance imaging).  It is used to take picture of inside the body.  How the pictures look is changed by the gadolinium compounds and how much water is around.  It makes the images clearer because it makes the difference in the concentration of water in different parts of the body look more clear (more contrast) in the picture that is made.

[[Persephone]]

CATEGORIES: Greek gods and goddesses

Persephone (Περσεφόνη, Persephonē) is the goddess of the dead and queen of the underworld in ancient Greek religion and myth. She is the daughter of Zeus and Demeter and is married to the god Hades, with whom she rules over the souls of the dead. As a vegetation goddess, she presided over the bounty of the harvest as it emerged during the season of spring. 

Persephone and her mother Demeter were the central figures of the Eleusinian Mysteries, which promised initiates a reward in the afterlife. The tale of her being abducted by Hades, during which she was tricked into eating seeds from a pomegranate (the food of the dead), served to explain the cause of the seasons, and is one prominently featured in ancient Greek literature. Her symbols included the pomegranate, flowers and seeds of grain. The goddess Proserpina is her Roman counterpart. 

[[German Bundestag]]

CATEGORIES: German Bundestag, Politics of Germany, Parliaments

The German Bundestag (commonly referred to as Bundestag) is the legislature of Germany. It meets in Berlin, in the Reichstag building, which was specially rebuilt ready for the Bundestag to move from Bonn.

The Bundestag has at least 598 members. Every 4 years the German people vote. After the 2017 election there were 709 members. In the election of 26 September 2021, 735 members were assigned - the base 598 seats plus 137 overhang and leveling seats. The next elections are in 2025.

A party gets seats when it gets at least 5% of the votes. Every voter has two votes, one for a person and one for a party. 299 members each represent a constituency, just as in the British House of Commons or the US House of Representatives. The other half are elected from a party list in each Land. The total number of seats a party gets depends on the number of the second "party votes" it gets.

But if a party wins more constituency seats than its share of the party votes, then it keeps those extra seats. These extra seats, or extra mandates, are the reason the Bundestag sometimes has more than 598 members. If a party gets extra mandates, the other parties get some extra seats too to make sure every party gets exactly its share of party seats. This system of giving extra mandates was changed in 2013. Before 2013, if a party won extra mandates, then it got to put more members in the Bundestag, which gave the party more influence over the Bundestag than it won in the elections. 

The Bundestag president is named Wolfgang Schäuble. He oversees the sessions of the body.

[[Daylight Saving Time]]

CATEGORIES: Time zones

[[File:DST Countries Map.png|thumb|A map showing countries that use daylight saving according to each hemisphere 2019.

#7F7F7F]]

Daylight Saving Time (DST) or Summer Time (ST) is a time to time keep during summer. During the summer months, the sun stays visible for a longer time, and sunset happens late in the day. For this reason, certain countries advance the time by one hour near the start of summer, and put it back one hour during autumn.

DST helps stores that sell to people after they get off work, and it doesn't hurt farmers and others whose hours are set by the sun. It cuts traffic accident rates. Sometimes it can reduce energy costs, but it can also increase them. 

Most of the world's countries do not use DST, but it is common in Europe and North America.

The United States, Australia, the United Kingdom, Canada and many other countries have DST. These countries also have regions that do not have DST:

Iceland, Russia, some parts of Ukraine and Belarus are countries in Europe without DST.

[[Rowing]]

CATEGORIES: Rowing, Summer Olympic sports

Rowing is about moving a boat on water using human muscle power. It can be a sport. The goal in rowing is to move as fast as possible on top of the water. The athletes use a boat. They move the boat forward by using two sculls or one oar. There are different types of rowing. The types depend on how many people are in the boat and if they have a coxswain or not. Rowing is a very popular sport in England, the Commonwealth, and the Northeastern United States. The old universities of the United States and England have yearly rowing matches.

[[Inkjet printer]]

CATEGORIES: Printers

An Inkjet printer is a printer for computers. It uses special ink to print on the paper. Another type of printing technology is the Laser printer. Inkjet printers are preferred for printing photos and graphics due to their high-quality color output, whereas laser printers are preferred for printing text due to their high contrast and speed.

Usually, inkjet printers are used by people who print very little. The ink comes in special ink cartridges, which can be very expensive and uneconomical. Also, the ink in the cartridge may dry up. This means that a new cartridge is needed. Three colors of cartridges, which combine magenta, yellow and cyan inks are used to create color tones. A black cartridge is also used for crisp monochrome  output. Some professional printers have one or more additional colors for better photo quality, such as light cyan, light magenta, blue, red, green, orange, and grey.

Inkjet printers may use either dye or pigment inks. Pigment inks are less likely to fade, whereas dye inks create more-realistic photos and are less likely to clog the printhead.

Many professionals use inkjet printers to print on very large surfaces (up to 5m width). These printers usually do not use cartridges, but have a continuous supply of ink that could last for a long time. Standard-size (A4 or US Letter) printers with a continuous ink supply are also available.

Inkjet printers need special paper. This paper has been treated so that the ink does not smear. 

Less expensive inkjet printers, which cost a little more than 100 US dollars, are a bargain for users who want to be able to print pages in color. Inkjet printers can be very cheap but the ink can also be rather expensive. Some professional inkjet printers can print on surfaces other than paper, such as CDs/DVDs or plastic cards.

An inkjet printer can print between 300 and 720 DPI (Dots Per Inch). Some newer printers can print at higher resolutions, although the benefit of resolutions beyond 720 DPI may not be noticed by the human eye.

A common problem with inkjet printers is that if the printhead is clogged, banding (stripes) will appear in the printed image. To fix this, the printhead needs to be cleaned using the software included with the printer. This problem occurs most often when the printer has not been used for a long time. To prevent this from happening on rarely-used printers, a cron job can be scheduled to print a purge sheet (an image containing all colors used by the printer) once per day. A small, barely noticeable (usually only noticeable by magnification) amount of banding will occur even with a perfectly clean printhead due to the way the printer works.

[[Laser printer]]

CATEGORIES: Printers

A laser printer is a printer for computers. It uses laser or LED-technology to get small particles of toner from a cartridge onto paper.  Very often, this costs less to use than the ink of inkjet printers.  Laser printers often print text more neatly than inkjet printers, but print photos less clearly. Printing on photo paper or coated paper designed for inkjet printers can damage the laser printer's drum and fuser unit.

The laser printer was first invented by a team at Xerox in 1969.April 2009 The first laser printer was called the Xerox 2000.

[[Lawrencium]]

[[Spring (water)]]

CATEGORIES: Bodies of water

A spring is a place where groundwater flows out of the ground. A spring may flow the whole year or only sometimes. This depends on the water getting into the ground all of the time (rain) or only once in a while (snow melting).

Water from a spring often flows downhill, along the land. This is how rivers start.

Some springs produce water that is good for health reasons. Sometimes towns grow by these springs because many people who are ill come there to get better. Such towns are called spa towns.

[[Thorium]]

CATEGORIES: Actinides, Chemical elements

Thorium is a chemical element in actinide group. It is a weakly radioactive metal. It has a shiny, silvery white color. It has the chemical symbol Th and the atomic number 90. Natural thorium has an atomic weight of 232. Thorium is named after Thor, the Norse god of thunder. Its ores are found in nature, especially in India, the United States, and Australia. 

Many scientists believe thorium would make a good source of nuclear fuel because it makes much less waste and is four times as common as uranium, and does not undergo the wasteful process of enrichment. It makes 3,200,000 times as much energy as coal and 200 times as much energy as uranium, because natural uranium is mostly non-fissile isotopes. Scientists believe that there is enough of it to power the world for thousands of years. Thorium has been used for various purposes since the 19th century. It is an alloying agent in magnesium and is also used as an industrial catalyst.

Thorium is safer than uranium. This is because thorium cannot undergo fission on its own. Usually, plutonium is need to start and maintain a reaction. This is why thorium is considered better for nuclear reactors. Also, nuclear waste from thorium reactors contains far smaller amounts of dangerous transuranic elements than waste from uranium reactors.

[[River source]]

CATEGORIES: Rivers

The source of a river or stream is the original point from which the river flows. It may be a lake, a marsh, a spring or a glacier.  This is where the stream starts.

The source is the farthest point of the river stream from its estuary or its confluence with another river or stream.  Rivers are usually fed by many tributaries.  The farthest stream is called the head-stream or head water. There is sometimes disagreement on which source is the head water, hence on which is the true source. 

A lake fed by many rivers is sometimes called the source of the bigger river flowing out of it. For example, Lake Victoria is often called the source of the Nile, as the rivers that flow into it have names of their own. 

Headwaters are usually in mountains. Glacial headwaters are made by melting of glaciers.

The source is where a river begins, and the river mouth is where it joins the sea.  The mouth may be in the form of a river delta.  The joining of a streams is called a confluence. 

[[Laserdisc]]

CATEGORIES: Optical discs, Video Discs

A Laserdisc, like a DVD, can play video of a higher quality than VHS. A Laserdisc is much larger than a DVD. To play Laserdisc movies, a LaserDisc player is needed. LaserDisc was also known by the names DiscoVision and LaserVision.

Laserdisc was first produced by MCA in 1978, and became well known in the 1980s. Movie companies stopped making Laserdisc movies when DVDs became well known in the late 1990s. Today some of the better Laserdisc players still sell for $1,000 USD or more.

[[Californium]]

CATEGORIES: Actinides, Chemical elements

Californium is a chemical element. It is a radioactive metal. It has the chemical symbol Cf. It has the atomic number 98. Californium is a transuranium element.  Californium does not have many uses. It was discovered by bombarding a curium target with alpha particles (helium ions). Californium is named after the US State of California, where it was discovered, in the University of Berkeley.

Californium is produced in nuclear reactors and particle accelerators. 

There are 20 known isotopes. The most stable is californium-251, which has a half-life of 898 years. This short half-life means the element is not found in the Earth's crust. Californium-252, whose half-life is 2.645 years, is the most common isotope used.

Compounds of californium are mostly of californium(III), which can take part in three chemical bonds. Californium can be used to help start up nuclear reactors, and is used as a source of neutrons. It can be used in making higher mass elements. Ununoctium was synthesized by bombarding californium-249 atoms with calcium-48 ions.

[[Torgau]]

CATEGORIES: Nordsachsen Rural District

Torgau is a town on the banks of the Elbe in northwestern Saxony, Germany. The town is well known as the place where during the Second World War, United States Army forces met with forces of the Soviet Union during the invasion of Germany on April 25, 1945.

This marked the beginning of the line of contact between Soviet and American forces, but not the occcupation zones. In fact the area surrounding Torgau at first occupied by U.S. forces was later, in July 1945, given over to Soviet forces.

[[Chemical bond]]

CATEGORIES: Quantum chemistry, Energy

Chemical bonds are what joins atoms together. Atoms bonded stay together unless the needed amount of energy is transferred to the bond. 

In general, strong chemical bonding comes with the sharing or transfer of electrons between the participating atoms. The atoms in molecules, crystals, metals and diatomic gases are held together by chemical bonds. 

There are two types of bonds; covalent and ionic. Covalent bonds form when atoms share electrons. Ionic bonding is the attraction between oppositely charged ions. Chemical bonds are negatively charged electrons that are pulling protons into each other.

Because atoms and molecules are three-dimensional, it is difficult to use a single method to indicate orbitals and bonds. In molecular formulas the chemical bonds between atoms are indicated in different ways depending on the type of discussion.

A common way chemists describe chemical bonds is through the number of electrons each atom has on itself. Each atom is drawn with the number of electrons as dots or lines to form a maximum of eight.  If the electrons form a chemical bond then a line is drawn between the two electrons. The number of bonds developed increases the number of lines.

Bonds can be double bonds or triple bonds

[[Physical property]]

CATEGORIES: Physics, Measurement

A physical property is a property, quality or way that an object is. A physical property can always be measured without changing or making the object chemically different or different in a way that would effect its chemical or atomic structure. There are two types of physical properties: intensive and extensive.

[[Concept]]

CATEGORIES: Language, Philosophy

A concept is an idea that is applied to all objects in a group. It is the way people see and understand something. The name used to identify a concept (the concept's label) is a "term". For example, the word "Dog" is the term to identify the concept of what a dog is. Everything that a person knows about a dog is the concept of the term dog. 

Different terms can be used to identify the same concept. Car and Automobile are synonyms for the same concept. Different languages have different terms for the same concept. This is what makes translation possible. The terms may be different in each language, but the concept is the same. The concept of jumping is the same to a person from England and a person from Italy, but one person uses the term "Jump" to mean the concept and the other person uses "Salto".

[[Kenpo]]

CATEGORIES: Martial arts

Kenpo or kempo is the descriptive name of various Japanese martial arts with Chinese origins, and also of hybrid martial arts: the Japanese ones and the Chinese ones. Kenpo is similar to karate and includes more punches and kicks than holds or joint locks of wrestling. 

==More known styles of Kenpo == 

Kempo is a Japanese Martial Arts form. However, unlike Karate, its origins are linked back to China and still have very strong influences from Chinese systems. 

It is not uncommon for a Kempo artist to both use traditional Japanese and Chinese style techniques. The difference lies in that because of the Chinese influence, the Japanese moves tend to emphasize more fluidity than most of the other Japanese styles. And because of the Japanese influence, there is a stronger focus for shorter stances and movements than other Chinese styles.

For the same reason that many other styles are sometimes simply listed as "karate", Kempo has long been strongly linked under the general banner of "karate". Kempo is known for its near explosive, short-ranged attacks that often move faster than the opponent can see. 

Kempo has a very strong presence in Hawaii, the home base for many of the systems under Kempo that exist today in the United States. Throughout each of the histories of the different groups there are strong signs of the continued merging of both Chinese and Japanese influences.

A semiconductor is a material that in some cases will conduct electricity but not in others. Good electrical conductors, like copper or silver, easily allow electricity to flow through them. Materials that block the flow of electricity, like rubber or plastic, are called insulators. Insulators are often used to protect people from electric shock. As the name implies, a semiconductor does not conduct as well as a conductor. Silicon is the most used semiconductor, but gallium arsenide is also used.

By the addition of different atoms into the crystal lattice (grid) of the semiconductor it changes its conductivity by making n-type and p-type semiconductors. Silicon is the most important commercial semiconductor, though many others are used. They can be made into transistors, which are small amplifiers. Transistors are used in computers, mobile phones, digital audio players and many other electronic devices.

Like other solids, the electrons in semiconductors can have energies only within certain bands (i.e. ranges of energy levels) between the energy of the ground state, corresponding to electrons tightly bound to the atomic nuclei of the material, and the free electron energy, which is the energy required for an electron to escape entirely from the material.

[[Elementary particle]]

CATEGORIES: Basic physics ideas, Elementary particles

In physics, an elementary particle or fundamental particle is a particle that is not made of other particles.

An elementary particle can be one of two groups: a fermion or a boson. Fermions are the building blocks of matter and have mass, while bosons behave as force carriers for fermion interactions and some of them have no mass. The Standard Model is the most accepted way to explain how particles behave, and the forces that affect them. According to this model, the elementary particles are further grouped into quarks, leptons, and gauge bosons, with the Higgs boson having a special status as a non-gauge boson.

Of the particles that make up an atom, only the electron is an elementary particle. Protons and neutrons are each made of 3 quarks, which makes them composite particles, particles that are made of other particles. The quarks are bound together by the gluons. The nucleus has boson pion fields responsible for the strong nuclear force binding protons and neutrons against the electrostatic repulsion between protons. Such virtual pions are composed of quark antiquark pairs again held together by gluons.

There are three basic properties that describe an elementary particle: ’mass’, ’charge’, and ’spin’. Each property is assigned a number value. For mass and charge the number can be zero. For example, a photon has zero mass and a neutrino has zero charge. These properties always stay the same for an elementary particle.

Mass and charge are properties we see in everyday life, because gravity and electricity affect things that humans see and touch. But spin affects only the world of subatomic particles, so it cannot be directly observed.

CATEGORIES: Basic physics ideas, Nuclear physics

In physics, spin is the constant rotation of an object. 

For large visible objects like the Earth, spin is the angular momentum of the turning of the Earth around its axis. This tells the amount of rotation that it has. Angular momentum changes with the mass and shape of the object, and with how fast it is turning.

[[Móði and Magni]]

CATEGORIES: Norse gods and goddesses

Magni and Móði (Old Norse: "strength" and "bravery") are a pair of minor deities in Norse mythology. They are sons of the god Thor, said to be embodiments of their father's traits. While Magni is born to Thor by the jötunn Járnsaxa (a lover of Thor), the name of Móði's mother is unknown. 

Other than his part after Ragnarök, little is known about Móði. Magni however, is featured prominently in the myth of Thor's battle with the giant Hrungnir. 

Thor hit the giant Hrungnir in the head with his hammer, Mjölnir, shattering Hrungnir's skull. The giant then fell dead, as his leg landed on Thor's neck, pinning the god to the ground. The other Æsir tried to lift Hrungnir's leg off of Thor, but were unsuccessful. Thor's son, Magni, who was only three days old at the time, then came to his father and lifted Hrungnir's leg off of Thor all by himself. In his gratitude, Thor gifted his son Hrungnir's horse, Gullfaxi (Old Norse: "Gold-mane"). Odin himself was upset that Thor gave the horse to "the son of a giantess" and not to Odin, Thor's own father.

[[Brass instrument]]

CATEGORIES: Brass instruments

A brass instrument is a musical instrument that you play by blowing through a mouthpiece to change the pitch, or note. 

Brass players use their breath to produce sound. Instead of blowing into a reed, they vibrate their lips by buzzing them against a metal cup-shaped mouthpiece. The mouthpiece helps to amplify the buzzing, which creates the sound. Most brass instruments have valves attached to their long pipes; the valves look like buttons. Pressing on the valves makes them open and close different parts of the pipe.

With brass instruments, the sound starts at the lips.

Their mouthpieces just help your lips buzz. It does not matter if the instrument is really made of brass, as long as it works that way. 

It is not important what the instrument is made of. Some brass instruments are really made of wood, but are still called brass instruments, like the serpent. Other instruments are made of brass but do not work like this, like the saxophone. They are not called brass instruments, because they don't work that way.

There are also parts of the instrument that change the resonance and thus the pitch, like slides or valves.

A brass band is a group of brass instruments and drums that play music together. They are often used to play for parades and processions because the players can march and play at the same time. Brass bands were very popular in England. Many factories and coal mines had their own bands. The workers would play in the bands after work. One famous band is the Grimethorpe Colliery Band.

[[Crystallization]]

CATEGORIES: Chemical processes, Physical chemistry

Crystallization is the way that atoms link up in a regular structure. The structure is held together by chemical bonds or connected groups.  Crystallization can be from a melt or from a solution, and can be natural or artificial.  Rarely, crystal can form directly from a gas. Faster crystallization makes smaller size crystals as in basalt, and slower can make bigger crystals, as in granite. 

Crystallization occurs in two major steps. The first is nucleation. This is the appearance of a crystalline phase from a supercooled liquid or a supersaturated solvent. The second step is crystal growth. This is the increase in the size of particles: it leads to a crystal state. Loose particles form layers at the crystal's surface and lodge themselves into open pores, cracks, etc.

Artificial crystallization is a technique to get solid crystals from a homogeneous solution. For crystallization to occur the solution should be supersaturated. Put simply, the solution should contain more solute molecules than it would under ordinary conditions. This can be achieved by various methods—solvent evaporation, cooling, and chemical reaction.

To make things clear we can use a simple example. We take a bowl of water to which we add sugar crystals. We keep adding sugar to it until we reach a stage when no more crystals can be dissolved. This solution is now a saturated one. It is interesting to note that we can dissolve more crystals to this particular saturated solution by heating it. Solubility of solutes increases with increase in temperature, but there are exceptional cases. This increase in temperature causes more sugar crystals to dissolve (so forming a supersaturated solution), but when the temperature of the solution cools down, the solubility of the solute decreases This is because the temperature of the solution has decreased, and the 'excess' sugar crystallizes out. This process illustrates the simplest of supersaturation techniques. 

'Drowning' is the addition of a nonsolvent in the solution that decreases the solubility of the solid. Alternatively, chemical reactions can also be used to decrease the solubility of the solid in the solvent, thus working towards supersaturation.

Crystallization can be divided into stages  primary nucleation is the first. It is the growth of a new crystal. In turn this causes secondary nucleation – the final stage if removal of the crystals is not an issue. Secondary nucleation needs existing crystals to continue crystal growth. In our sugar example, we had got such nuclei when the 'excess' sugar had just about crystallized out. Secondary nucleation is the main stage in crystallization for this is what causes the 'mass production' of crystals.

[[Base (chemistry)]]

CATEGORIES: Chemistry

A base is a substance that can accept a hydrogen ion (H+) from another substance. A chemical can accept a proton if it has a negative charge, or if the molecule has an electronegative atom like oxygen, nitrogen, or chlorine that is rich in electrons. Like acids, some bases are strong and others are weak. The weak bases are less likely to accept protons, while the strong bases quickly take protons in solution or from other molecules.

An acid is a base's "chemical opposite". An acid is a substance that will donate a hydrogen atom to the base. 

Bases have a pH greater than 7.0.  Weak bases generally have a pH value of 79 while strong bases have a pH value of 9–14.

[[Accounting]]

CATEGORIES: Accounting

Accounting or accountancy is the job of sharing financial information about a business to managers and shareholders (people who have invested in the business). Accounting is often called the "language of business". Accountants are people who do accounting, and also carry out the auditing or checking of a company's books and records. In Britain, this auditing is often carried out by a qualified person called a "chartered accountant". In the United States, the professional designation is Certified Public Accountant or "CPA". 

When accountants do accounting work, they write in the books of account (ledgers) that belong to a company. Every time money is spent or earned, it is written in the ledger. The information in the ledger is used to prepare the company accounts monthly, quarterly (every three months) and annually (every year). These annual accounts show what money the company has taken in over time and what it has spent money on. It also shows if the company made a profit in the year (if it made more money than it spent), who owes the company money, who the company owes money to, and any big expensive items the company has bought which they expect to use for many years. Lenders, managers, investors, tax authorities (the people who collect taxes for the government) and other decision-makers look at these annual accounts. Managers and investors look at the ledger and make decisions about how to spend money in the future. Lenders like banks look at the accounts before they lend money to the company. Tax authorities look at them to check that the company is paying the correct amount of taxes.

CATEGORIES: 1632 births, 1723 deaths, Dutch scientists, Microbiologists, People from Delft

Antonie Philips van Leeuwenhoek (24 October 1632 – 30 August 1723; last name pronounced 'Layvenhook') was a Dutch tradesman and scientist from Delft, Netherlands. He is best known for his work to improve the microscope.

Using his handcrafted microscopes, he was the first to see and describe single celled organisms, which he originally referred to as animalcules, and which we now refer to as microorganisms. He was also the first to record microscopic observations of muscle fibers, bacteria, spermatozoa and blood flow in small blood vessels. Van Leeuwenhoek did not write books, but sent letters to the Royal Society in London. The letters were published in the Royal Society's journal Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society.

In his youth van Leeuwenhoek was apprenticed to a draper. Later, a civil service position allowed him to give time to his hobby: grinding lenses and using them to study tiny objects. His simple microscopes were skillfully ground, powerful single lenses capable of high image quality. He looked at protozoa in rainwater, pond water and well water. He also looked at bacteria in the human mouth and intestine. In 1677, he first described the spermatozoa of insects, dogs, and humans.

His observations laid the foundations for the sciences of bacteriology and protozoology. He was the first to see bacteria, protists, spermatozoa, the cell vacuole, blood corpuscles, capillaries, and the structure of muscles and nerves.

[[Barbie]]

Barbie  is a fashion doll best known as a toy doll. Starting as just a doll, Barbie became a brand. It is most common in the United States. It is named after a girl named Barbara, who was the toy maker's daughter. Though the brand is most famous for the doll, other merchandise has been created with the Barbie name such as games, movies, videos, clothing, accessories, and books. The clothes and fashion accessories allow  girls a taste of high fashion. 

Throughout the decades, Barbie has reflected and encouraged feminine growth in the workplace in the United States. She has been a miniature model of women worldwide. The doll has been criticized for causing self-image complexes, yet other companies continue to produce similar dolls. "The Barbie doll is the biggest selling toy in the history of proprietary toy manufacturing." On average, 172,000 dolls are sold by Mattel each day.

[[Parmesan cheese]]

CATEGORIES: Italian cheeses

Parmesan cheese is the name of an Italian extra-hard cheese made of raw cow's milk. The original Parmesan cheese is more precisely called Parmigiano-Reggiano. It is produced only in Italy, in the provinces of Parma, Reggio Emilia, Modena, Mantua (partly) and Bologna (partly). It is usually the cheese to go with Spaghetti and other typical Italian pasta, but it also has many other uses. Parmesan is a part of Italian national cuisine and it can be eaten both grated and in slivers. It is hard, sharp and dry.

Parmigiano-Reggiano is DOP / AOC. This means that the way they are made and the region in Italy they come from are strictly controlled.

The brand (Parmigiano Reggiano) is protected, and only in Europe. In many parts of the world, cheese is sold as Parmesan cheese that has nothing to do with the true (Italian) Parmigiano Reggiano.

The original Parmesan cheese is one of the most expensive cheeses in the world.

Liszt (pronounced like “list”) was one of the most important musicians of the 19th century. He was the greatest pianist of his time and went on lots of tours through Europe where everyone filled the concert halls to hear him. He wrote a lot of music for piano. Many of his piano pieces were harder to play than anything that had been written before. In this way he developed the technique of piano playing, setting new standards for the future. In his compositions he often used new ideas which sounded very modern in his time. He was very helpful to other composers who lived at that time, helping them to become better known by conducting their works and playing some of their orchestral pieces on the piano.

[[Mozzarella]]

CATEGORIES: Italian cheeses

Mozzarella is a kind of  fresh cheese. Originally, it was Italian but now it can be found all over the world. Its made of the milk of cows or water buffalos. A cheese produced in a similar way, but with sheep's milk is common in Sardinia, Abruzzo and Lazio. It is sometimes called mozzapecora. Mozzarella made with goats milk can also be found. Its development is more recent, though. The main reason it is produced is that goats' milk is easier to digest than that of cows or buffalos.

Mozzarella is common in Italian cuisine. It can be used on pizza.

Mozzarella can be kept in the fridge for a few days, if its covered in brine. 

Mozzarella can come in different moistures. 

[[Limburger cheese]]

CATEGORIES: Belgian food, Dutch cheeses, Liège (province), Limburg (Belgium), Limburg (Netherlands)

Limburger cheese is a cheese made from cows' milk. Its name comes from the Duchy of Limburg, which is divided between Holland, Belgium and Germany today. Limburger cheese is known for its strong smell, which is caused by the bacterium that lives in its rind. Since about the mid nineteenth century, most Limburger is produced in Germany. 

In 2006 a study showing that the malaria mosquito (Anopheles gambiae) is attracted equally to the smell of Limburger and to the smell of human feet earned the Ig Nobel Prize in the area of biology. This Cheese has now been placed in strategic locations in Africa to fight against malaria, which is spread by  mosquitoes.

[[Bora Bora]]

CATEGORIES: Islands of French Polynesia

Bora Bora is a small island in the Leeward group of the Society Islands of French Polynesia, an overseas territory of France in the Pacific Ocean. Vaitape is the largest city on the island with 4,000 people. There is an airport on an islet where residents can fly to other islands in French Polynesia.

Bora Bora has one main road which runs around the island.

[[Appalachian Mountains]]

CATEGORIES: Appalachian Mountains

The Appalachian Mountains (French: les Appalaches) are a large group of North American mountains. They are partly in Canada, but mostly in the United States. They form an area from 100 to 300 wide, running 1,500 from the island of Newfoundland in Canada to central Alabama in the United States. 

The individual mountains average around 3,000 ft (900 m) in height. The highest is Mt. Mitchell in North Carolina (6,684 ft or 2,037m). Mt. Mitchell is also the highest point in the United States east of the Mississippi River as well as the highest point in eastern North America.

The Appalachian chain is a barrier to east-west travel. Ridgelines and valleys run north-south and travelers must climb them again and again. Only a few mountain passes run east-west. The Erie Canal was built through one of them. In most places the Appalachians are the watershed between the drainage basins of the Mississippi River and the Atlantic Ocean.

The term Appalachia is used to refer to the mountain range and the hills and plateau region around it.  The term is often used to refer to areas in the central and southern, but not northern, Appalachian Mountains.  These areas usually include all of West Virginia and parts of the states of Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, and North Carolina, and sometimes extending as far south as northern Georgia and western South Carolina, as far north as Pennsylvania, and as far west as southeastern Ohio. In 1965 the United States Congress  created an Appalachian Regional Commission to include these areas and more, as far west as Mississippi.

The Appalachian Trail in the US is about 3,500km (2,190 miles) long and goes through 14 states from Georgia to Maine.

In August 2013 Raven-Symoné commented on legalizing gay marriage, "I was excited to hear today that more states legalized gay marriage. I, however am not currently getting married, but it is great to know I can now, should I wish to". She was dating AzMarie Livingston since 2012, and in October 2015, she announced that she had broken up with her.

[[Arabian horse]]

CATEGORIES: Horse breeds

The Arabian horse is a breed famous for beauty and stamina. It is one of the oldest horse breeds in the world. Arabian horses are bred with horses of other breeds to add speed, beauty, endurance, and strong bones. Today, Arabian ancestors are found in almost every breed of riding horse.

The Arabian horse developed in the deserts of Arabia by the Bedouin people. People sometimes brought their horses into family tent for shelter and protection. This close relationship with humans made the Arabian a horse with a kind temper and quick to learn. It also was used as a war horse. This meant that it needed speed and to be very alert. This blend of traits makes it necessary for people today to treat Arabian horses with kindness and respect. 

[[Earth's crust]]

CATEGORIES: Structure of the Earth

The Earth's crust is the Earth's hard outer layer. It is less than 1% of Earth's volume. The crust is made up of different types of rocks: igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks.

Below the crust is the mantle. The crust and the upper mantle make up the lithosphere. The lithosphere is broken up into tectonic plates that can move.

The crust is of two different types. One is the continental crust (under the land) and the other is the oceanic crust (under the ocean). The continental crust is thicker, 30 km (20 mi) to 50 km (30 mi) thick. It is mostly made of less dense, more felsic rocks, such as granite. The oceanic crust is thinner, 5 km (3 mi) to 10 km (6 mi) thick. It is made of denser, more mafic rocks, such as basalt.

The temperature of the crust increases with depth because of geothermal energy. Where the crust meets the mantle the temperatures can be between 200 °C (392 °F) to 400 °C (752 °F). The crust is the coldest layer because it is exposed to the atmosphere.

[[Food chain]]

CATEGORIES: Food and drink, Ecology

A food chain shows the feeding relationship between different organisms in a particular environment and/or habitat. Plants are at the bottom of a food chain because they are producers that make their food from a process called photosynthesis . Organisms that can make their own food are called producers. Consumers are animals that eat the products of producers or other animals. The animal that eats the producer is called the primary consumer and it gains the most amount of energy. The animal that eats the primary consumer is called a secondary consumer which in the primary consumer's energy which is transferred becomes lower due to the primary consumer consuming some energy. The animal that eats the secondary consumer is called a tertiary consumer and so on to fourth, fifth, etc. The direction of arrows between the organisms shows who eats what and what gets eaten by what.

A food chain also represents a series of events and consumption in which food and energy are consumed from one organism in an ecosystem to another. Food chains show how energy is passed from the sun to producers, from producers to consumers, and from consumers to decomposes such as fungi. They also show how animals depend on other organisms for food.

In any ecosystem, many food chains overlap. Different food chains may include some of the same organisms. Several consumers may eat the same kind of plant or animal for food. When this happens, the food chain forms a food web. A food web shows how food chains are related within an ecosystem and how the cycles balanced between an equilibrium

[[Embryology]]

CATEGORIES: Developmental biology

Embryology is the study of embryos and their development. The study of embryology starts with the fertilisation of an egg, and continues until the foetus stage. A broader term, developmental biology, covers the whole period of growth from the egg to adult life.  

In mammals (and some other animals) embryos develop inside the mother, in the mother's womb. Otherwise it takes place after the egg is laid. It most animals, there are various stages between the egg and the adult animal. If the stages are well-defined the process is called metamorphosis. 

[[Histology]]

CATEGORIES: Histology, Anatomy, Laboratory techniques

Histology is the study of the microscopic anatomy of cells and tissues of plants and animals, particularly the tissues. It is a part of cytology, and an essential tool of biology and medicine.

Histology is usually done by looking at cells and tissues under a light microscope or electron microscope. The tissue has to be specially prepared beforehand.

[[Ann Arbor, Michigan]]

CATEGORIES: County seats in Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, 1824 establishments in the United States, 1820s establishments in Michigan Territory

Ann Arbor is a city in the US state of Michigan. It is the county seat of Washtenaw County. According to the 2010 United States Census, Ann Arbor was the 6th largest city in Michigan. In 2010, there were 113,934 people living there. The city is part of the Detroit Metropolitan Combined Statistial Area.

Ann Arbor was started in 1824. It is thought that the city is named after the wife, Ann, of one of the founders.1-2 The University of Michigan was moved to Ann Arbor in 1837. (Before that, the University had been in Detroit.) The city grew during the 1800s and 1900s. The only time the city did not grow was the Depression of 1873.

During the 1960s and 1970s, Ann Arbor was an important place for the Civil Rights Movement, the anti-Vietnam War movement, and for left-wing and liberal politics.

Today, Ann Arbor is home to the University of Michigan. The University is very important to the city because 30,000 people work for it. 12,000 of these workers work for the University of Michigan Health System, which are hospitals and clinics run by the University. Ann Arbor's economy is also very high-tech. High-tech companies come to the area because there are many graduates and a lot of research and development money at the University.

[[Microbiology]]

CATEGORIES: Microbiology, Viruses, Protista, Prokaryotes

Microbiology -  (Greek μικρός, mikrós, „tiny“, βίος, bíos, „life“ and λόγος, lógos, „science“) is a science in the composition of biology, which is occupied by the study of microorganisms (bacterium, (archaebacteria), microscopic fungi, protozoa,alga,and viruses). Into the field of the interests of microbiology enter their systematics, morphology, physiology, biochemistry, evolution, role in the ecosystems 

and also the possibility of practical use. Bacteriology is a division of microbiology.

[[Transposable element]]

CATEGORIES: Genetics, Evolutionary biology

A  transposable element  is often called a transposon. It is a sequence of DNA that can move to new positions in the genome of a single cell. The press sometimes call them jumping genes, but it is not correct to call them 'genes'.

Transposons were first found by Barbara McClintock while working on maize in the 1930s to 1950s. She discovered transposition in maize, but it took years before her work was understood. She received a Nobel Prize for her work in 1983.

Transposition can create significant mutations and alter the cell's genome size.

[[Toowoomba]]

CATEGORIES: Cities in Queensland

Toowoomba (also called 'Garden City' by people who live there) is a city in South East Queensland, Australia. It is 132 km west of Brisbane, and two hours drive from the Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast beaches. About 115,000 people live there, which makes Toowoomba Australia's second largest city that is not on the coast, after Canberra.

Every year in September, Toowoomba holds its annual Flower Festival. When this is taking place, the town, especially its CBD are decorated with flowers. People who live there may also open their gardens for public judging for the garden competitions. Another attraction is the parade, where one would see floats with flower themes. Many people from all over the nation visit the festival, and a popular way to arrive is on the specially operating retired steam train.

Another major event held in Toowoomba is the Easterfest. It is a large religious festival that thousands of people come to, to see many famous singers perform. Many put up tents on in Queens Park.

Toowoomba is also known for its historical buildings, such as the town hall, The Empire Theatre, and the Cobb & Co Museum. The town hall was the first in Queensland to be built for a town hall. The Empire Theatre was built as a silent movie house in 1911. A fire nearly destroyed the building, but it was built again, and reopened in 1933. Now, it is the biggest regional theatre in Australia. The Cobb & Co Museum began in the 1880s as a small mail run. It moved both mail and passengers to Brisbane and further.

Toowoomba is also home to some notable private schools, including Toowoomba Grammar School (which is a GPS school), Downlands College, and The Glenny School, none of which are 'co-educational'.

During the 2010-2011 Queensland floods, several people were drowned in their cars when water flooded the main shopping centre.

[[Albury, New South Wales]]

CATEGORIES: Cities in New South Wales

Albury is a city in New South Wales, Australia. It is on the Hume Highway that runs between Sydney and Melbourne. The Murray River separates Albury from Wodonga. Albury is on the north side of the Murray River. The river is also the border between Victoria and New South Wales. It is about 550 km from the state capital Sydney, but only 312 km from the Victorian capital Melbourne. Albury is believed to have been named after Aldbury in Hertfordshire.

The Australian Aboriginal people called the area Bungambrewatha. There are a number of historical aboriginal sites including rock paintings. There are also scarred trees, where the bark has been removed to make shields and canoes. The rich river flats would have provided food for native animals, and the wetlands would have been home to large numbers of water birds.

The first Europens to arrive in the area were the explorers, Hamilton Hume and William Hovell in 1824. They made their mark in a tree on the riverbank which later became the spot where people heading south would cross the river. Crossing the river was easy in summer when the water level was low. By 1844 a ferry was built to carry people over the river all year. There were soon many farmers moving into the area with large flocks of sheep. Some of the first in Albury were William Wyse and Charles Ebden.

Calendar eraAn era in geology is a time of several hundred million years. It describes a long series of rock strata which geologists decide should be given a name. An example is the Mesozoic era, when dinosaurs lived on the Earth. 

An era is made up of periods, and several eras make up an eon. The Phanerozoic eon started about 541 million years ago (mya). It is made up of the Paleozoic era (from the Greek for "oldest life"), the Mesozoic era ("middle life") and the Cainozoic era ("latest life").

[[Drowning]]

CATEGORIES: Water

Drowning is a form of death caused by being suffocated with water or another liquid.

Near drowning is the survival of a drowning event where the person is unconsciousness (passed out) or breathes in a dangerously large amount of water, and can cause serious problems, including death, later on. That means that near drowning also requires help from a doctor. 

Secondary drowning is death caused by chemical or biological changes in the lungs after a near drowning incident.

Drowning happens when a person spends too much time underwater or with their nose and mouth submerged in a liquid to the point where they are unable to breathe and their lungs are full of liquid.

In many countries, drowning is one of the biggest causes of death for children under 14 years old. Children have drowned in wading pools and even bathtubs. Many people drown in countries where there is a lot of water, especially if they swim in dangerous waters.  For example, in the United Kingdom there are about 450 drownings each year (that is: 1 per 150,000 of its people), and in the United States there are about 6,500 drownings (or around 1 per 50,000 of its people). Drowning related injuries are the fifth most likely cause of accidental death in the US. In some places, drowning is the second most likely cause of injury and death for children. 

[[Schrödinger's cat]]

CATEGORIES: Quantum mechanics, Basic physics ideas

Schrödinger's cat is a thought experiment about quantum physics. Erwin Schrödinger suggested it in 1935, in reaction to the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum physics. 

Schrödinger wrote:

In simple terms, Schrödinger stated that if you place a cat and something that could kill the cat (a radioactive atom) in a box and sealed it, you would not know if the cat was dead or alive until you opened the box, so that until the box was opened, the cat was (in a sense) both "dead and alive". This is used to represent how scientific theory works. No one knows if any scientific theory is right or wrong until said theory can be tested and proved.

Physics can be divided into two types; classic physics and quantum mechanics. Classic physics explains most physical interactions, like why a ball bounces when it drops. It can also be used to predict physical interactions, like what will happen when you drop a ball. However, there are some physical interactions which it does not explain; for instance, how light can be turned into electricity. Quantum mechanics provides a way for physicists to explain why these things happen. 

The Copenhagen interpretation is used to explain what is happening to the smallest part of an atom (a sub atomic particle) without looking at it (observing it or measuring it). Mathematics are used to show how likely something is to happen to the particle. A particle could be described as being 50% likely to be in one place at one time, or 50% likely to be in one place at another time. This could also be expressed as a chart (or wave form). This is very convenient when making quantum physics calculations. 

However the only way to be 100% sure of where a particle is, is to observe it. Up until the point that you observe it, the Copenhagen Interpretation says that the particle is there and is not there. It is only when you observe the particle that you know if it's there or not there.  

While this makes sense in quantum physics, it does not make sense in classical (real world) physics.  

Schrödinger wanted to show that this way of thinking about quantum mechanics would lead to absurd situations. He designed a thought experiment. 

A cat is placed in a room that is separated from the outside world. 

A Geiger counter which counts the amount of radioactive decay and a little bit of a radioactive element are in the room. 

Within one hour, one of the atoms of the radioactive material might decay (or break down because the material is not stable), or it may not. 

If the material breaks down, it will release an atomic particle, which will hit the geiger counter, which will release poison gas, which will kill the cat.

The question now is: at the end of the hour, is the cat alive or dead? Schrödinger says that according to the Copenhagen Interpretation, as long as the door is closed, the cat is dead and alive. There is no way to know until the door is opened. But by opening the door, the person is interfering with the experiment. The person and the experiment have to be described with reference to each other.

By looking at the experiment the person has influenced the experiment, therefore it may not give us the correct answer. 

The thought experiment was invented by Schrödinger to demonstrate the foolishness of thinking about quantum states for large objects. It has also been referenced many times in pop culture.

[[Rock–paper–scissors]]

CATEGORIES: Games

Rock, paper, scissors (RPS) is a two-person hand game. It is often used as a selection method in a similar way to coin flipping or drawing straws to randomly select a person for some purpose. However, unlike truly random selections, it can be played with skill if the game extends over many sessions, as a player can often recognize and exploit the non-random behavior of an opponent.

Sportsmen often use RPS (both officially and unofficially, in place of a coin toss) to decide on opening plays. Similarly, uncertain calls, or even the whole game in case of rain, may be so decided. It is also often used as a method for creating appropriately non-biased random results in live action role-playing games, as it requires no equipment. It is also used in some gambling sites as a form of novelty betting.

The exact name of the game can vary, with the three components appearing in a different order, or with "stone" in place of "rock". Non-English speakers may know the game by their local words for "rock, paper, scissors", although it is also known as Janken or Yakyuken in Japan, Kawi Bawi Bo in Korea, Pierre-Papier-Ciseaux in France, Ca-Chi-Pun in Chile, and in South Africa as Ching-Chong-Cha, the words used in the 'count'.

The players both count aloud to three, or speak the name of the game (e.g. "Rock! Paper! Scissors!" or "Reaux! Sham! Beaux!"), each time raising one hand in a fist and swinging it down on the count. On the third count, or on a further beat after the third count (saying "shoot"), the players change their hands into one of three gestures, which they then "throw" by extending it towards their opponent.

Rock is represented by a closed fist. 

Paper is represented by an open hand. 

Scissors is represented by the index and middle fingers extended. 

The objective is to select a gesture which defeats that of the opponent. Gestures are resolved as follows:

Rock blunts/smashes scissors; rock wins. 

Paper covers rock; paper wins. 

Scissors cut paper; scissors wins. 

In terms of logic, this type of game is intransitive.

If both players choose the same gesture, the game is tied and played again.

In some variations of the game, the winner of each round "uses" the weapon on the opponent's weapon, to demonstrate that they have won.

RPS is frequently played in a "best two out of three" match, and tournament players often prepare sequences of three gestures ahead of time.

[[Film noir]]

CATEGORIES: Film noir

Film noir is a term used to describe crime drama movies from Hollywood that are often focused on sex, crime, and corruption. 

Film noir movies were mostly made from the early 1940s to the late 1950s in the United States, and they were usually filmed in black-and-white. The term "film noir" comes from the French term for "black film" or "dark film". Film noir movies include many different genres of movies, such as gangster movies, police movies, and detective movies. 

Film noir movies were often filmed so that there were many dark shadows in the movie, even on characters' faces. The Hollywood film noir movies were influenced by German film directors such as Fritz Lang, who used dramatic lighting techniques. Another influence on film noir movies was 1930s French books or movies about heroes who would die at the end of the story or stories with sad endings. Film noir movies were also influenced by crime fiction, such as the detective and crime stories by Dashiell Hammett, James M. Cain, and Raymond Chandler.

[[Jazz fusion]]

CATEGORIES: Jazz music

Jazz fusion (or "jazz-rock fusion" or fusion) is a genre or style of music. Jazz fusion mixes jazz with rock. Some jazz fusion also uses funk, rhythm and blues and world music.

Jazz fusion is usually played with instruments, without singing. The songs are often longer than those in pop music. A jazz fusion song could be five to ten minutes long. A pop song is usually about three minutes long. Also, jazz fusion songs have a long solo played by instruments. Frank Zappa, for example, had long guitar solos in his music, which was of the jazz fusion genre. In jazz fusion, solos are improvised, or made up as they are played, during a performance.

Jazz fusion music is not heard much on the radio in the United States or Canada. In Europe, it is more popular on radio stations.

The Arc de Triomphe (meaning arch of victory),  at the centre of the place de l'Étoile and the western end of the Champs-Elysées, is a very famous monument in Paris.

Emperor Napoléon Bonaparte commissioned it in 1806 after victory in the Battle of Austerlitz. It is a large arch, but it is not possible to drive underneath it. Jean-François Chalgrin designed it, and it has roughly 300 steps that lead to the top. It has four main sculptures and six reliefs. Just beneath the vault of the arch, there is the tomb of the unknown soldier. The names of French generals and battles are engraved on the walls.

[[Traffic light]]

CATEGORIES: Traffic

Traffic lights (or traffic signals) are lights used to control the movement of traffic. They are placed at road intersections and crossings. The different colors of lights tell drivers what to do.

[[Railway signal]]

CATEGORIES: Rail technologies

A railway signal or just signal is a mechanical or electrical machine that gives train drivers or engineers information about the line ahead. These traffic signals say whether the train must stop or may continue and what speed the train may go.

In Britain, modern signalling uses a system similar to road traffic lights. The signals are coloured lights mounted on a pole. A red signal means 'do not go further'. A yellow signal gives a warning to the driver that the next signal is showing a red.  Some signals can show two yellow lights, known as a "double yellow" and are warnings to the driver that the next signal is showing a yellow.  A green signal means 'you can continue'.

On older lines semaphore signals are still used.  These are poles with a coloured bar at the top, which can be moved so that it is either horizontal, or at an angle.  When a red bar is horizontal this means that the train must stop, and when it is pointing diagonally up or down it means that it's safe for the driver to continue.  There are also signals with yellow bars which give warnings in the same way as yellow lights on newer signals.

[[Zupaysaurus]]

CATEGORIES: Ceratosaurs

Zupaysaurus was a dinosaur that lived in South America 213 million years ago, during the Upper Triassic period. It was about 5 meters (15 feet) long. A dinosaur very similar to it, Dracovenator, lived in South Africa at the same time. 

During the Triassic period, all the continents were connected to form the supercontinent of Pangaea, and animals could migrate freely between them. Zupaysaurus was a carnivore.  

[[Zephyrosaurus]]

CATEGORIES: Hypsilophodontidae

Zephyrosaurus was a small dinosaur. It was a relative of Hypsilophodon. It lived 132 million years ago, in the western part of what is now North America. It was 6 ft (2 metres) long and 3 ft (1 metre) high.

The remains are bones from various parts of the body. It had a steep face, a raised knob on the upper jaw, and a larger knob on the cheekbone. Some of the bones may have allowed movement within the skull (cranial kinesis) as well. Like other hypsilophodonts, it had beak teeth.

[[Hypsilophodon]]

CATEGORIES: Hypsilophodontidae

Hypsilophodon was a small, fast-running, plant-eating dinosaur. It lived 125 million years ago, was 2.3 metres long (7/8 feet), including tail, and weighed about the same as a man.

It was originally thought to be a young Iguanodon which could climb trees. Later it was realised to be a different species, and to be a running dinosaur, not adapted for climbing.

[[Dryosaurus]]

CATEGORIES: Iguanodonts

Dryosaurus was a small plant-eating ornithopod dinosaur that lived in forests of western North America around 150 million years ago.

Its family, the Dryosauridae, were precursors (ancestors) of the Iguanodons, and lived from the Middle Jurassic to the Lower Cretaceous.

[[Iguanodon]]

CATEGORIES: Iguanodonts

Iguanodon is a genus of ornithopod dinosaur from the Lower Cretaceous period in Europe, North America, Africa and Asia. It lived 125/126 million years ago (mya).

Discovered in 1822 and described three years later by English geologist Gideon Mantell, Iguanodon was the second dinosaur formally named, after Megalosaurus. Together with Megalosaurus and Hylaeosaurus, it was one of the three genera originally used to define Dinosauria.

A large, bulky herbivore, Iguanodon is thought by some to be in the same family as the duck-billed hadrosaurs. The taxonomy of the genus continues to be a topic of study as new species are named or long-standing ones reassigned to other genera.

Scientific understanding of Iguanodon has evolved over time. New information is got from the fossils. Researchers have made informed hypotheses about  the living animal, including feeding, movement, and social behaviour.  As one of the first scientifically known dinosaurs, Iguanodon has a small but notable place in the public's perception of dinosaurs. Its artistic representation changed after new interpretations of its remains.

[[Xylem]]

CATEGORIES: Vascular tissue, Plant physiology

Xylem is a tissue in vascular plants. Its cells have thick, hard walls. Xylem tissue dies soon after it is formed and is the wood in the middle of a tree. The dead cells are like pipes, hollow and rigid.

Xylem is one of two tissues in the plant which transport substances that plants need to live. Substances that xylem transports include water and minerals obtained through the plant's roots, as xylem runs from the roots to the stems and leaves. The other transport tissue is the phloem, which transports energy in the form of sugar (as well as any other chemicals) from the leaves to the rest of the plant.

Xylem cells are present in all parts of a plant, in stems, roots, and leaves. Water is carried against gravity by the negative pressure that builds up through the process of transpiration, which is the evaporation of moisture in leaves.

Xylem consists of four types of cells:

Most of these cells are dead cells and have thick walls.

[[Allosaurus]]

CATEGORIES: Jurassic dinosaurs, Carnosaurs

Allosaurus was a large theropod dinosaur from the Jurassic period, a predatory carnivore.

Allosaurus averaged 8.5 metres (28 ft) in length, though some remains suggest it could reach over 12 meters (39 ft). Its three-fingered forelimbs were smaller than its large hind legs, and the body was balanced by a long, heavy tail. It weighed 2/3 tons.

It is the most common large predator found in the Morrison Formation of North America. This formation was laid down 155 to 145 million years ago, in the Jurassic.

Allosaurus was at the top of the food chain. It probably preyed on large herbivorous dinosaurs and perhaps even other predators (e.g. Ceratosaurus). Potential prey included ornithopods, stegosaurs, and sauropods.

Some paleontologists think Allosaurus had cooperative  behavior, and hunted in packs. Others believe they may have been aggressive toward each other.

Groups have been found together in the fossil record. This might be evidence of pack behavior, or just the result of lone individuals feeding on the same carcass.

Remains of many individuals have been found, including some which are almost complete. Over sixty-nine individuals from one species have been found.

[[Ceratosaurus]]

CATEGORIES: Dinosaurs of Africa, Jurassic dinosaurs, Ceratosaurs

Ceratosaurus was a predatory dinosaur from the Upper Jurassic period, 156 to 145 million years ago. It had a large horn on its nose, and a pair of smaller horns in front of its eyes. Uniquely among theropods, Ceratosaurus had armor, in the form of small osteoderms running down the middle of its back.

[[Carnotaurus]]

CATEGORIES: Abelisauridae, Dinosaurs of South America

Carnotaurus was a predatory dinosaur that lived 70 million years ago. It was a large theropod which lived in South America during the Upper Cretaceous between about 72 and 70 million years ago. Although there is only one well-preserved skeleton, it is one of the best-understood theropods from the southern hemisphere. The skeleton, found in 1984, was uncovered in the Chubut Province of Argentina. 

Carnotaurus is a member of the Abelisauridae, a group of large theropods. The abelisaurids were a family of large theropods which lived only in the ancient southern supercontinent Gondwana. They were the dominant predators of the later Cretaceous of Gondwana. They occupied the ecological niche filled by the tyrannosaurids in the northern continents.   

[[Coelophysis]]

CATEGORIES: Coelophysidae, Triassic dinosaurs

Coelophysis was a small fast running carnivorous dinosaur. It is one of the earliest known genera of dinosaur. Coelophysis was found in Upper Triassic strata dated to about 200 million years ago (mya). It lived in what is now the southwestern United States. Similar dinosaurs are found all over the world at that time.

Coelophysis walked on two legs (as did all theropods). It was no more than about three feet (1 meter) tall at the hips but because of a long tail could be almost 10 feet (3 meters) long. There is some evidence that these animals hunted in packs, from the large numbers found together at the Ghost Ranch fossil site in New Mexico.

[[Dilophosaurus]]

CATEGORIES: Theropods

Dilophosaurus (meaning 'double-crested lizard') was a medium-large dinosaur from 190 million years ago.

Dilophosaurus has been examined several times over the years and has been put into no less than nine different theropod groups. It may be related to the smaller Coelophysis. Specific details of its life-style are few. Some of its fossils were found in terrain which was a low-lying slow-moving river system at the time. The animal was obviously a carnivore.

Dilophosaurus was shown in the movie When Dinosaurs Roamed America scaring off a pack of Megapnosaurus and eating an Anchisaurus.

[[Elasmosaurus]]

CATEGORIES: Plesiosaurs

Elasmosaurus was a 46 foot long swimming reptile that lived in the North American Inland Sea. It was a plesiosaur. 

It was first discovered in 1868 by a scientist named Edward Drinker Cope who accidentally put the head on the tail. It had 71 cervical vertebrae. 

It was suggested by D.M.S. Watson that their method was as surface swimmers, mostly eating with their head above water, darting down to snatch smaller fish which were feeding on plankton. It is hard to see the benefit of a long neck under water. Aquatic mammals operating under water all have a streamlined torpedo-shape, as did pliosaurs and ichthyosaurs. All the longer-necked families were, from the setting of the teeth and jaws, eaters of small fish. The large number of neck vertebrae is probably linked to the modest degree of flexibility between adjacent vertebrae.

[[Waffen-SS]]

CATEGORIES: War crimes, World War II, Military of Germany, SS

The Waffen-SS was part of the Schutzstaffel (SS). "Waffen-SS" means "armed SS" in German. The Waffen-SS was a paramilitary organization within the SS.

The divisions of the Waffen-SS were made of specially trained soldiers. Their original job was to protect higher-ranking people in the SS and the Nazi Party. Together with the Sturmabteilung ("Storm Battalion," or SA), they were used as a police force. The Waffen-SS was officially an extra police force on the streets.

In 1937, some soldiers were reorganized.  Nazi leaders gave some SS members the job of guarding and running concentration camps (and, later, death camps).  These soldiers were moved from the Waffen-SS to the SS-Totenkopfverbände.

In some of the concentration camps, like Auschwitz and Buchenwald, doctors of the Waffen-SS did experiments on humans.

Heinrich Himmler led the SS from 1929 until Nazi Germany lost World War II in 1945. After World War II, the SS were found guilty of crimes against humanity, and the SS was made illegal.

[[Pizzicato]]

CATEGORIES: Musical performance techniques

Pizzicato means:  playing a string instrument by plucking the strings (pulling a string with the finger and letting go quickly).  Instruments such as the violin, viola, cello and double bass are normally played with a bow, but if the composer wants the player to pluck instead of bow, the word “pizzicato” or just “pizz” is written in the music.  When the player has to play with the bow again the word “arco” is written in the music (“arco” is the Italian word for “bow”).

[[Movement (music)]]

CATEGORIES: Musical forms

Long pieces of classical music are often divided into movements.  They are like different sections of the piece. Movements can be quite short, or extremely long.  If you listen to a symphony it may often be divided into four movements.  In the time of Haydn and Mozart the four movements were normally: a fast movement, a slow movement, a dance-like movement (minuet) and a fast movement to end the work.

Concert programmes usually show how many movements there are in the work that is being performed.  It may show this using Italian musical terms (e.g. Allegro meaning fast, Presto meaning very fast or Andante meaning a gentle walking pace).   Here is an example:

Robert Schumann:   Symphony no 4 in D minor op.120

Sometimes an orchestra will take a minute or two to retune their instruments, especially in a symphony by Mahler or Shostakovich where one movement might be as long as 25 minutes.  At other times the conductor or performer will want to go almost straight on with hardly any break.  Sometimes the composer shows that there should be no break at all between movements.

Audiences in the olden days often used to clap between movements, but usually these days they wait until the end of the work to applaud.

The German word for “movement” (in this musical sense) is “Satz” which really means “sentence”.  A movement is like a sentence: a collection of things that belong together to make sense.  All the movements together are like several sentences: they tell the whole story.

[[Worms, Germany]]

CATEGORIES: Cities in Rhineland-Palatinate, Imperial free cities, Worms, Germany

Worms (pronounced /voɐms/) is a city in southwestern Germany in the federal state of Rhineland-Palatinate (Rheinland-Pfalz). It lies on the River Rhine. Worms is famous for its local Liebfraumilch wine. It is an industrial center, producing chemicals and metal goods. At the end of 2004, it had 85,829 inhabitants.

Along with Cologne and Trier, Worms is one the oldest cities in Germany.  But, there is a disagreement which of the three is actually the oldest. The town is mentioned in the Nibelungenlied, an old Germanic saga. The town was also very important because of Martin Luther who defended his case against the emperor Charles V in Worms.

The Cathedral of Saint Peter is a very large church in the town. It is one of only three Romanesque cathedrals in Germany. The other two are in Mainz and Speyer. The Worms cathedral is one of the most important Romanesque buildings in Germany. 

[[Transistor]]

CATEGORIES: Electronic components

A transistor is an electronic component that can be used as part of an amplifier, or as a switch. It is made of a semiconductor material. Transistors are found in most  electronic devices. The transistor was a major advancement after the triode tube, with using much less electricity, and lasting many years longer, to switch or amplify another electronic current.

The transistor can be used for a variety of different things including amplifiers and digital switches for computer microprocessors. Digital work mostly uses MOSFETs. Some transistors are individually packaged, mainly in order to handle high power. Most transistors are inside integrated circuits. 

[[Sex toy]]

CATEGORIES: Human sexuality, Sex industry

A sex toy is a device that helps humans get more pleasure when they have sex or when they masturbate. Sometimes these devices are also called Adult toy, or Marital aid. Marital aid can also apply to certain herbs or drugs that have such an effect. Herbs with such an effect are called aphrodisiac. 

Types of sex toys include: 

[[Compsognathus]]

CATEGORIES: Coelurosaurs

Compsognathus was a small carnivorous theropod dinosaur, from the end of the Jurassic period, 144 million years ago. It was about a metre long, and ran on two legs, using its long tail to keep its balance.

Compsognathus is known from two nearly complete specimens, one from Germany (89 cm 35 in long), and another from France (125 cm 49 in long). The German specimen was found in the Solnhofen limestone in Bavaria, over 150 years ago.

The larger French specimen (MNHN CNJ 79) was discovered in 1972 in the Portland limestone, near Nice in southeastern France. Although originally described as a separate species called Compsognathus corallestris, others have since renamed it as another example of Compsognathus longipes.

It is one of the few dinosaurs whose diet is known with certainty: the remains of small, agile lizards are preserved in the bellies of both specimens. Also it was once the smallest dino on earth but now that belongs to the Micropachycephalosaurus

[[Micropachycephalosaurus]]

CATEGORIES: Cerapods

Micropachycephalosaurus, a tiny thick headed lizard, is a genus of ornithischian dinosaur from the Upper Cretaceous. It was a herbivore, and lived in what is now Shandong, China. It was one of the smallest dinosaur ever discovered, just over a meter long, but with the longest name. Before it was discovered Compsognathus was the smallest known dinosaur.

The lack of the skull roof means the fossil cannot be placed at family level. It might or might not be a pachycephalosaur. Butler and Zhao therefore classified it as an indeterminate member of the Cerapoda. In 2011, cladistic analysis showed that Micropachycephalosaurus is a basal member of the Ceratopsia. In this context, basal does not mean 'ancestral'; the fossil is far too late for that. It means simply 'unspecialized', or lacking derived traits.

[[Velociraptor]]

CATEGORIES: Dromaeosauridae, Feathered dinosaurs

Velociraptor  was a small theropod dromaeosaur of the Upper Cretaceous, about 75–71 million years ago, and also a smaller relative of the famous Deinonychus.

It was a slender, lightly built carnivore. It was about two meters long (nearly seven feet) and 0.62 meters tall at the hip.

Velociraptor had one sickle-shaped claw on its foot which measured 6.5 centimeters along its length, and a smaller one on each hand. Velociraptor was warm blooded and had feathers.

Fossils from China suggest that the whole clade had similar traits.

Fossils of Velociraptor were first found in the Gobi Desert of Mongolia in 1922. In 1988, scientists from China found Velociraptor skeletons in northern China.

A famous Velociraptor, discovered in 1971, was found attacking a Protoceratops in a fossil from Mongolia.

Víðarr (Old Norse: "the wide ruling one") is the god of vengeance in Norse mythology. A member of the Æsir, he is the son of Odin and the giantess Gríðr. During Ragnarök, when the monstrous wolf Fenrir swallows Odin whole, Víðarr is told to avenge his father's death, as he takes Fenrir by the jaw and tears his head apart, killing Fenrir. He will ultimately survive Ragnarök, as he will then meet with his brother Váli in Iðavöllr, where Asgard once lay; there they are joined by their brothers, Höðr and Baldr, as well as Thor's sons, Magni and Móði.

[[Segisaurus]]

CATEGORIES: Coelophysidae

Segisaurus was a small dinosaur from the Triassic. It was a relative of Coelophysis.

[[Psittacosaurus]]

CATEGORIES: Ceratopsids

Just genus named Psittacosaurus is a small ceratopsian dinosaur from the Lower Cretaceous of what is now Asia, about 130 to 100 million years ago. It was more basal than other members of the Ceratopsia: it was bipedal, and had no horns or frill on its head. What made it a ceratopsian was its beak.

It is notable for being the most species-rich dinosaur genus, but there is no general agreement on these species. Nine to eleven  species are named for fossils found in different regions of China, Mongolia and Russia, with a possible additional species from Thailand.

All species of Psittacosaurus were gazelle-sized bipedal herbivores with a high, powerful beak on the upper jaw. At least one species had long, quill-like structures on its tail and lower back, possibly with a display function. Psittacosaurs were early ceratopsians. They developed  adaptations of their own, but they also shared features with later ceratopsians, such as Protoceratops and the elephant-sized Triceratops.

[[Zuniceratops]]

CATEGORIES: 1904 births, 1918 deaths, Murders by firearm in Russia, Russian murder victims, Russian nobility, Russian Orthodox saints, House of Holstein-Gottorp-Romanov

Tsarevich Alexei Nikolaevich Romanov (12 August 1904 – 17 July 1918) was the heir apparent of Russia during the Russian Revolution. He would have become Tsar Alexei II. He was the youngest of five children and the only son of Tsar Nicholas II of Russia and Alexandra Fyodorovna. His sisters were Olga, Tatiana, Maria, and Anastasia.

He had the disease hemophilia. He inherited the disease from his mother. The disease can be traced back to his great grandmother Queen Victoria. His father gave up the throne in 1917 and his family was exiled and then murdered in Ekaterinburg in 1918. When Alexei was struggling with hemophilia a Russian Orthodox monk named Grigori Rasputin, commonly known as Rasputin, healed Alexei better than any doctor could. This might have led to the family's murder, because they were so fond of Rasputin. Once Rasputin was murdered, Alexei and his family were murdered only two years later. 

In 2000, Alexei and his family were made saints by the Russian Orthodox Church.

In 2008 his body was one of those found near the site where the family was murdered. DNA tests proved all 5 of the Tsar's children had been killed.

[[Zalmoxes]]

CATEGORIES: Ornithopods

Zalmoxes is a genus of ornithopod dinosaur from the Upper Cretaceous of Romania. It was a relative of Iguanodon and, like all its order, it was a herbivore. 

Most of the skeleton is known with exception of the end of the tail, the hands and the feet.

[[Oviraptor]]

CATEGORIES: Oviraptorosauria, Fossils

Oviraptor is a genus of dinosaurs from what is today Mongolia. Oviraptor was a relatively large-brained dinosaur which cared for its eggs. In 1924, an Oviraptor fossil was found on top of some eggs, and some thought that it had been eating the eggs. Others thought that the fossilized Oviraptor was probably a parent of the eggs in the nest, and not an egg stealer.

Oviraptor lived in the Upper Cretaceous period, about 75 million years ago. Only one definite specimen is known (with associated eggs), from Mongolia, though a possible second specimen (also with eggs) comes from the northeast region of Inner Mongolia, China.

Oviraptor is usually drawn with a distinctive crest, similar to that of the cassowary. However, re-examination of  several oviraptorids show that this well-known, tall-crested species may actually belong to a relative of Oviraptor, the genus Citipati. It is likely that Oviraptor did have a crest, but its exact size and shape are unknown due to crushing in the skull of the only recognized specimen.

Judging by its relatives, Oviraptor probably had feathers. It had a toothless beak, but its feeding habits are unknown. The only Oviraptor fossil preserved the remains of a lizard in the region of its stomach cavity, implying that the species was at least partially carnivorous.

[[Oyster]]

CATEGORIES: Bivalves, Seafood

Oysters are a family of bivalves with rough, thick shells, the Ostreidae. Some other types of shellfish are also called 'oyster'. Many species are edible, and are usually served raw. They are also good when cooked. 

In the past, they were an important food source, especially in France and Britain. They used to grow in huge oyster beds, but were "overfished" in the 19th century. Nowadays they are more expensive, so eaten less often.

Oysters are usually harvested before they are fully grown. Left to themselves, they do grow quite large. A recent example was an oyster which was 11 inches long (29cm) and 3.7 lbs in weight (1.7kg). The BBC report says "The family (firm) estimated it could be between '15 and 20 years old' due to its size. The world's largest oyster was 13.97 inches long (35.5cm) and  4.21 inches (10.7cm) in width. It was found in Denmark in December 2013, Guinness World Records said".

Oysters are picked up from their muddy beds by dredging. The oysters are "shucked" from their shells before sale. Shucking is done with a short knife inserted between the upper and lower shell. The adductor muscle, which holds it closed, is cut away, and that releases the oyster. The oyster is sold loose but within its shell. Shucking method:

The seawater the oysters were in does not stay in the oyster. Oysters (and shellfish generally) are purified while still alive before sale. That starts after they are harvested. The oysters are put into tanks pumped with clean water for 48 to 72 hours. That protects the consumer from any foul bacteria that the oyster might have picked up from the sea or river water.

Some of the unrelated 'oysters' are the pearl oyster, Pinctada, which is a clam, and a few mussels which look a bit like oysters when they are taken out of their shells.

[[Tumour]]

CATEGORIES: Health problems, Illnesses, Diseases

A tumour (or tumor) is tissue that is growing where it should not be. Another name for a tumor is neoplasm. Tumours are either malignant (harmful) or benign (safe).  Cancer, for example is malignant and sometimes spreads to other places on the body. Some tumours have a cause that makes them grow. For some tumours no cause is known. A tumour usually forms as a lump or mass.  

The Tasmanian Devils in Tasmania, Australia are in danger of becoming extinct because of a malignant tumour that grows on their face.

The Australian dollar is also used on Christmas Island, Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Norfolk Island, and the independent Pacific Islands of Kiribati, Nauru and Tuvalu. In Australia the dollar symbol $ is usually used. The signs A$ or AU$ are often used to show that it is the Australian dollar. It is subdivided into 100 cents.

In 2011 the Australian dollar was the fifth-most-traded currency in world. The most traded currencies were the US dollar, the Euro, the yen, and the pound sterling.

The Australian dollar is liked by people who trade in currencies. This is because Australia has high interest rates and little government control on currency trading. Australia's economy and political systems are also seen to be stable.

CATEGORIES: Home appliances

A washing machine is a machine that washes dirty clothes. It contains a barrel into which the clothes are placed. This barrel is filled with water, and then rotated very quickly to make the water remove dirt from the clothes. Most washing machines are made so that detergent (liquids or powders) can be put into the machine. These can help make the clothes cleaner.

[[Benign]]

CATEGORIES: Medicine

The word benign is often used to refer to a medical condition that will not become life-threatening if it is not treated, but can also mean that something is not harmful.  It is often used in relation to tumours that do not metastasise to other parts of the body.  Tumours that are referred to as being benign may still be life-threatening because of other reasons.  Because of this, the term applies mainly to their biological behaviour.

Tumors that are benign may be at risk of changing into malignancy.  These are termed "premalignant".

[[Velocisaurus]]

CATEGORIES: Ceratosaurs, Dinosaurs of South America, Cretaceous dinosaurs

Velocisaurus was a theropod dinosaur related to Ceratosaurus. Its remains were found in Patagonia, in strata from the Cretaceous period.

This animal is known only from its leg and feet bones. Velocisaurus was probably around 1.2 meters long (4 ft). The foot is unique in that the middle (third) metatarsal (foot bone) was the main weight-bearing element. Its upper end has thickened and the shafts of the adjoining second and fourth metatarsals have thinned considerably. Such a condition is unknown for other theropods, including birds, but a similar set-up occurred in three-toed horses (like Mesohippus). José Bonaparte explained it as an adaptation for a cursorial (running) lifestyle. He suggested that Velocisaurus was itself an omnivore, because the sole claw found, of the fourth toe, was not curved, but relatively straight.

[[Valdosaurus]]

CATEGORIES: Iguanodonts

Valdosaurus ("Weald Lizard") is a type of dinosaur. It walked on two legs and ate plants.  It was found on the Isle of Wight and other places in England. It lived during the Lower Cretaceous.

It is part of the Dryosauridae family. It is related to the Iguanodonts.

[[Irish Potato Famine]]

CATEGORIES: 1840s in Europe, 1850s in the United Kingdom, Disasters in the United Kingdom, History of Ireland, Potatoes

The Great Famine, Great Hunger, or Potato Famine is the name given to the famine in Ireland in the years 1845-1852. Outside Ireland, it is usually called the Irish Potato Famine. The famine was caused by "the potato blight", a  fungus-like organism which quickly destroyed the potatoes in Ireland, and throughout Europe. The effect was particularly bad in Ireland because potatoes were the staple food for most Irish people at the time.

It is believed that between 1 million to 1.5 million people died in the three years from 1846 to 1849 because of hunger or disease. Another million became refugees because of the famine. Many people who left Ireland moved to Great Britain, (mostly to the nearby town of Liverpool), the United States, Canada and Australia.

In Ireland this time is referred to as "the starvation".  The potato was the only crop affected, yet Ireland continued to produce corn, wheat, barley, and beef.  However, the mostly English landlords made a bigger profit by selling these food products elsewhere.

By the late 17th century, potatoes had become common as a supplementary rather than a major food. The diet was mainly around butter, milk, and grain products. Potato became a base food of the poor, especially in winter. The lack of genetic variability among the potato plants in Ireland caused the emergence of Phytophthora infestans which had devastating effects in Ireland. Another factor is that holdings were so small that no crop other than potatoes would be able to feed a family.

Starting in 1801, Ireland had been directly governed, under the Act of Union as part of the United Kingdom. In the 40 years after the union, British governments grappled with the problems of governing the country. One historian calculated that, between 1801 and 1845, there had been 114 commissions and 61 special committees enquiring into the state of Ireland. "Without exception their findings prophesied disaster. Ireland was on the verge of starvation, her population rapidly increasing, three-quarters of her labourers unemployed, housing conditions appalling and the standard of living unbelievably low". It was caused by monoculture because they only planted one main crop and let its disease infest all other potatoes in the Irish territory.

[[Wannanosaurus]]

CATEGORIES: Pachycephalosauria, Cretaceous dinosaurs

Wannanosaurus is the smallest known ornithischian dinosaur. Its length is estimated at just less than a metre. It lived in the Upper Cretaceous, about 80 million years ago, and was found in Anhui, China. 

It is known from a single partial skeleton, including a partial skull roof and lower jaw, an upper leg and lower leg, part of a rib, and other fragments. It was herbivorous, but may also have eaten insects. Wannosaurus means Wanno lizard. It is one of several pachycephalosaurs with flat-topped skulls.

[[Chihuahua (dog)]]

CATEGORIES: Dog breeds

A chihuahua is a very small kind of dog and is bred to be a pet.

[[Minmi]]

CATEGORIES: Ankylosauria

Minmi is a genus of small ankylosaurian dinosaur that lived during the Lower Cretaceous of Australia, about 119 to 113 million years ago.

A recent cladistic analysis suggests that Minmi is the most basal known ankylosaur.

That does not mean it was the ancestor of the group; it is far too late for that. It means its body is not specialized, and is relatively unchanged from whatever was the ancestral group.

Two good specimens of Minmi have been described, including a mostly complete skeleton, and additional fragments may belong to this genus. The dinosaur grew to about 2 m (6.5 ft) long (Holtz), or 3 m long and weighed about 300 kilograms (Paul). It was roughly 1 m (3 ft) tall to the top of the shoulder.

[[Rugops]]

CATEGORIES: Dinosaurs of Africa, Abelisauridae, Cretaceous dinosaurs

Rugops was a dinosaur related to Carnotaurus. It lived in what is now Africa, about 95 million years ago. It was a medium-sized carnivorous dinosaur, up to 27 feet long. 

Rugops lived at the same time Spinosaurus, Carcharodontosaurus, and Deltadromeus, in the Upper Cretaceous. 

Rugops was a carnivore, with weak jaws and small teeth.  It may have been a scavenger, feeding on dead animals.  It also may have preyed on sauropods, such as Paralititan and Aegyptosaurus, and ornithopods, such as Ouranosaurus.  The name "Rugops" means "wrinkled face".  The bony wrinkles on its snout may have helped to support a structure, such as horny crest or a wattle, like on a rooster or a turkey. 

[[Abrictosaurus]]

CATEGORIES: Dinosaurs of Africa, Heterodontosaurs, Jurassic dinosaurs

Abrictosaurus was a heterodontosaurid dinosaur from the Lower Jurassic of what is now southern Africa. It was a small bipedal herbivore or omnivore, about 1.2 meters (4 feet) long, and weighing less than 45 kilograms (100 pounds).

Abrictosaurus is usually thought to be the most basal member of the family Heterodontosauridae. Lycorhinus and Heterodontosaurus both had high-crowned cheek teeth, which went over each other in the jaw, making a continuous chewing surface analogous to those of Cretaceous hadrosaurids. Abrictosaurus had more widely-split cheek teeth, with lower crowns, more similar to other early ornithischians. 

The family as a whole has canine-like tusks. Tusks were clearly present on one of the two specimens of Abrictosaurus. The upper caniniform measured 10.5 millimeters (0.4 inches) high, while the lower reached 17 mm (0.67 in). 

Abrictosaurus had smaller, less powerful forelimbs than Heterodontosaurus and one fewer phalanx bone (finger joint) in both the fourth and fifth digits of the forelimb.

[[Heterodontosaurus]]

CATEGORIES: Heterodontosaurs

Heterodontosaurus (meaning "different toothed lizard") is a genus of small herbivorous dinosaur with prominent canine teeth. 

It lived in the Lower Jurassic of South Africa, 200–190 million years ago. It was related to Abrictosaurus. It had three different kinds of teeth.

[[Camarasaurus]]

CATEGORIES: Sauropods

Camarasaurus (meaning "chambered lizard") was a large plant-eating sauropod. It was about 18 meters long and weighed about 18 metric tones. Its name comes from its skull, which is in the shape of an arch. It lived during the late Jurassic, between 155 and 145 million years ago. These dinosaurs may have lived in herds.

It was first discovered in 1877 in Colorado by Oramel W. Lucas. Its fossil remains have been found in the Morrison Formation of Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming.

There are four species of Camarasaurus:

It was shown in the movie When Dinosaurs Roamed America.

[[Great Fire of London]]

CATEGORIES: 1666, 1660s in Europe, 17th century in England, Building and structure fires in the United Kingdom, Fires in London, History of London, September events

The Great Fire of London happened in Central London in 1666. The fire lasted for just under five days, from 2nd September until 6th September.

It is believed to have destroyed the homes of 70,000 of the 80,000 people that lived in the city. It is not known how many people died in the fire. Only a few deaths are certain, but for many of the victims there were no records. The fire may have cremated many, leaving no recognisable remains. It threatened the aristocratic district of Westminster (the modern West End), Charles II's Palace of Whitehall, and most of the suburban slums, however, it never reached these districts. 

The fire started at the bakery of Thomas Farriner (or Farynor) on Pudding Lane. It began just after midnight on Sunday 2nd September and grew very fast. Firefighters of the time usually made firebreaks by destroying buildings around the fire so it could not spread. This did not happen quick enough. Lord Mayor, Sir Thomas Bloodworth was not certain what to do. By the time he ordered such measures, it was too late. The Tower of London guard used gunpowder to make good firebreaks that stopped the fire from spreading to the east.

The fire pushed north on Monday into the center of the city. Some people thought that foreigners were setting the fires. They believed it was the French and Dutch, who at that time were England's enemies in the Anglo-Dutch Wars. On Thursday, the fire spread over most of the City, destroying St. Paul's Cathedral and crossed over the River Fleet. It was close to setting fire to Charles II's court at Whitehall.

The social and economic problems created from this were very large. Leaving London to go and live elsewhere was strongly encouraged by Charles II. He feared a London rebellion amongst the refugees who had lost their property. Despite numerous radical proposals, London was reconstructed on essentially the same street plan used before the fire.

The fire is said to have also helped to get rid of the Great Plague which had hit London in 1665, and killed about 70,000 of the 90,000 population, who may have died in the fire. We are able to know a lot about the great fire of London because Samuel Pepys wrote in his famous diary at the time. When the fire started, he looked out of his window, saw the fire and started writing about it. 

[[Golgi complex]]

CATEGORIES: Organelles

The Golgi complex, also known as the Golgi apparatus or simply the Golgi, is a cytoplasmic organelle. It is found in eukaryote cells, as in animals, plants, and fungi. 

The complex was discovered by Camillo Golgi in 1898. Golgi, who worked at Pavia, Italy, was ignored. His discovery was said to be dirt on his lenses. Years later, electron microscope pictures showed structures just like in the original Golgi drawings. It is made of several flattened sac-like membranes which look like a stack of pancakes.

The main function of the Golgi apparatus is to process and package macromolecules, such as proteins and lipids. They come to the Golgi after being built, and before they go to their destination. Much of the enzymatic processing is post-translational modification of proteins. The Golgi complex inspects them for flaws and discards extra material added during their manufacture, wraps them up and then targets them for packaging. The Golgi complex is especially active in processing proteins for secretion. The Golgi releases special enzymes called lysosomes, which clean off any extra amino acids. When the package is ready, it is pinched off the Golgi and released into the cytoplasm. 

The Golgi complex is part of the cellular membrane system, and so is the endoplasmic reticulum.

[[Superconductor]]

CATEGORIES: Electronics, Magnetism

A superconductor is a substance that conducts electricity without resistance when it becomes colder than a "critical temperature."  At this temperature, electrons can move freely through the material. Superconductors are different from ordinary conductors, even very good ones. Ordinary conductors lose their resistance slowly as they get colder. In contrast, superconductors lose their resistance all at once. This is an example of a phase transition. High magnetic fields destroy superconductivity and restore the normal conducting state.

Normally, a magnet moving by a conductor produces currents in the conductor by electromagnetic induction. But a superconductor actually pushes out magnetic fields entirely by inducing surface currents. Instead of letting the magnetic field pass through, the superconductor acts like a magnet pointing the opposite way, which repels the real magnet. This is called the Meissner effect, and it can be demonstrated by levitating a superconductor over magnets or vice versa.

[[Sunflower]]

CATEGORIES: Flowers, Asterales, Symbols of Kansas

The sunflower (Helianthus annuus) is a living  annual plant in the family Asteraceae, with a large flower head (capitulum). The stem of the flower can grow up to 3 metres tall, with a flower head that can be 30 cm wide.  Other types of sunflowers include the California Royal Sunflower, which has a burgundy (red + purple) flower head.  

The flower head is actually an inflorescence made of hundreds or thousands of tiny flowers called florets. The central florets look like the centre of a normal flower, apseudanthium. The benefit to the plant is that it is very easily seen by the insects and birds which pollinate it, and it produces thousands of seeds.

The sunflower is the state flower of Kansas. That is why Kansas is sometimes called the Sunflower State.

To grow well, sunflowers need full sun. They grow best in fertile, wet, well-drained soil with a lot of mulch. In commercial planting, seeds are planted 45 cm (1.5 ft) apart and 2.5 cm (1 in) deep.

[[Impeachment]]

CATEGORIES: Impeached officials removed from office, Politics

Impeachment is a way to remove government officers from office in some countries. 

Impeachment in the United States is the process by which the House of Representatives brings charges against either the President, the Vice President, or any federal officer for misconduct alleged to have been committed.

It is like an indictment (what the prosecutor needs to get before a trial). Someone is impeached when a legislature votes to do that. Later, there is another vote on whether or not to convict, which is like guilty or not. The second vote may be by the same people who did the impeachment, or someone else as in a bicameral legislature. Several different types of office holders may be impeached, but cases against the President or leader of a country usually attract the most attention.

Two well-known heads of state who were impeached and removed from office were Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff in 2016 and South Korean president Park Geun-hye in 2017. Three American presidents were impeached: Andrew Johnson, Bill Clinton and Donald Trump, Donald Trump was officially impeached two separate times by the house of representatives, but none were removed from office. President Richard Nixon resigned from the office of President before the House could impeach him, resulting in him being the only U.S. president to resign.

[[Indictment]]

CATEGORIES: Criminal justice, Legal terms

In common law, an indictment is a charge saying that a person committed a very serious crime. They used to be given out by grand juries (a special jury usually made up of 24 people that is used to see if a person should be charged), but many places do not have grand juries anymore. Sealed indictments are kept secret until they are unsealed.

[[Great Plague of London]]

CATEGORIES: 1660s in Europe, Disasters in the United Kingdom, History of London, Plague pandemics, 17th century in England

During the Great Plague of London (1665-1666), the disease called the bubonic plague killed about 200,000 people in London, England.  In seven months, almost one quarter of London's population (one out of every four Londoners) died from the plague.  At its worst, in September of 1665, the plague killed 7,165 people in one week.  After this, the number of people dying from the plague began to slow down.  

Around September of 1666, the great outbreak ended.  The Great Fire of London, which happened on 2-6 September 1666, may have helped end the outbreak by killing many of the rats and fleas who were spreading the plague.

Though most of the people who died during the Great Plague lived in London, the plague also killed people in other areas of England.  By the time the Great Plague ended, about 2.5% of England's population had died from the plague.  To compare, about 2% of the entire United Kingdom's population (including soldiers and civilians) died in World War I, and about 1% of the entire United Kingdom's population died in World War II.

[[Nibelungenlied]]

CATEGORIES: German literature

The Nibelungenlied, translated as The Song of the Nibelungs, is an epic poem in Middle High German. It tells the story of dragon-slayer Siegfried at the court of the Burgundians, and of the revenge of his wife Kriemhild, which leads to the death all the heroes of the Bugundians and of Kriemhild as well.

The saga of Siegfried was also used in the opera cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen of Richard Wagner.  Nibelung in this context means "dwarf".

The Nibelungenlied is based on earlier works. It was part of oral tradition, meaning it usually was not written down. During the Middle Ages people started to write down stories more and more. Overall there are about 35 German sources and one Dutch source for the story. There was an original manuscript but it has been lost. The three oldest manuscripts have been labelled A, B, and C.  

B seems to be closest to the original; however, the real relation between the three manuscripts is unknown. The Nibelungenlied probably had a broad oral tradition, as there were many different versions. It is difficult to judge how these oral versions influenced the written ones.

Manuscripts A and B end with daz ist der Nibelunge not (that is the fall of the Nibelungs); for this reasons, they are known as the Not versions. Manuscript C ends with daz ist der Nibelunge liet (that is the song/epic of the Nibelungs). It is known as the Lied-version. In total, the C text has been edited with regard to the public of the time. It is less dramatic. This probably made it more popular. Aesthetically, the B text would have been the greatest artistic achievement for a contemporary public.

[[Dwarf (mythology)]]

CATEGORIES: Mythology

A dwarf is a short, humanlike creature from Norse and Germanic mythologies. They have been used in many fairy tales, fantasy, fiction and role-playing games.

In some stories, dwarfs are mean, living under bridges, and having a bad reputation for stealing treasure.  One example is the Norwegian Troll.  It is an ugly and foolish creature who tells lies.  It causes problems everywhere it goes.  That is how the Internet troll got its name.  In Robert Louis Stevenson's story, "Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde," Edward Hyde is described as "a dwarf."

On the other hand, J. R. R. Tolkien's hobbits and the munchkins in The Wizard of Oz are likeable, honest, good and smart.  

[[Vanir]]

A number of them live in Asgard alongside the Æsir as a token of goodwill following the war between the two tribes, which resulted in them uniting into a single pantheon. The goddess Freyja receives half of those slain in battle as a share of power between the two clans.  

[[Mole (unit)]]

CATEGORIES: Chemistry, SI units

Mole is the SI unit used to measure how many molecules or atoms there are. One mole is around 600 sextillion molecules. Scientists use this number because 1 gram of hydrogen is around 1 mole of atoms.

The exact value of one mole is 6.02214078. This number comes from experiments with carbon because it's easy to work with.

6.02214078 is also called Avogadro's number, which was named after the person who invented it.

Anything can be measured in moles, but it is not practical for most tasks because the value is so massive. For example, one mole of grapefruits would be as big as the earth. 

Because different molecules and atoms do not have the same mass, one mole of one thing does not weigh the same as one mole of something else. Atoms and molecule mass is measured in amu. One amu is equal to one gram per mole. This means that if an atom has a mass of one amu, one mole of this atom weighs one gram.

[[Plesiosaurus]]

CATEGORIES: Plesiosaurs

Plesiosaurus was a large fossil marine reptile, a genus in the order Plesiosauria. 

The first specimen discovered by Mary Anning in 1820-21 was missing its skull. She found it on the 'Jurassic Coast' of Lyme Regis, Dorset, England. In 1823 she found another one, this time complete with its skull. The name Plesiosaurus was given by the Rev. William Conybeare.

Plesiosaurus was a predator, living mostly on fish and belemnites. It would swim through schools of fish and use its long neck and sharp teeth to snap them up.

Plesiosaurus was a fairly typical member of its order, and measured around 3 to 5 metres (10 to 16 ft) in total length. The snout was short, but the jaws were able to open very wide, and had a series of conical teeth in sockets. The neck was quite long, and the short tail was used for steering. Like all plesiosaurs, it used its large paddles to swim.

Only two species are known, and the genus existed for about 25 million years from the beginning of the Jurassic period.

Scientists have wondered whether ancient reptiles like pleisiosaurs were warm-blooded or cold-blooded. Scientists from the University of Plymouth studied many animals of different sizes from insects to whales that dive and hold their breath. They found that larger animals can hold their breath longer than smaller animals because they can store more oxygen. They also found this difference was much bigger for warm-blooded animals than for cold-blooded animals. They said this could be why whales became so large. They think since plesiosaurs were also large, like whales, they were more likely to be warm-blooded than cold-blooded.

Scientists also looked at the phosphate molecules inside plesiosaurs' teeth and saw the oxygen isotopes that suggested they had been warm-blooded.

[[Doraemon]]

CATEGORIES: Manga, Anime

Doraemon (ドラえもん) is a Japanese manga and anime series and franchise. It was written and illustrated by Fujiko F. Fujio. It was started in a children’s magazine in 1969. Doraemon is the name of a robot cat that came from the future to help a boy named Nobita Nobi. Doraemon is about the life of Nobita Nobi. In a typical story Doramon uses a gadget to solve a problem for Nobita, but Nobita goes too far and ends up being punished and learning a lesson.

Doraemon was turned into an anime television show in 1979. It still is being shown on television. As of 1996, about 100 million comic books have been sold. A Japanese-to-English version of the original called Doraemon: Gadget Cat from the Future was published from 2002. A local translation is published in each Asian country such as Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea and Vietnam. It is in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Australia, but it is not as popular as it is in Asia. Doraemon is endorsed by 7-11 in Thailand as a mascot.

[[Oort cloud]]

CATEGORIES: Solar System

The Oort cloud, or Öpik–Oort cloud, is a cloud of comets and other objects.  Astronomers believe it is way beyond the orbits of Pluto and the Kuiper belt. The Oort cloud is believed to be the source of long-period comets in the Solar System.

The Oort cloud may lie about 50,000 AU, or nearly a light-year, from the Sun. This means the cloud is nearly a quarter of the way to Proxima Centauri, the nearest star to the Sun. 

The Kuiper belt and scattered disc, the other two reservoirs of trans-Neptunian objects, are less than one thousandth of the Oort cloud's distance. The outer limit of the Oort cloud defines the boundary of the Solar System and the region of the Sun's gravitational dominance.

The Dutch astronomer Jan Hendrik Oort published the Oort cloud idea in 1950. The Oort cloud was named after him, as were the Oort comet, and Oort constants.

[[Han dynasty]]

CATEGORIES: Chinese dynasties, 3rd-century BC establishments, 3rd-century disestablishments

The Han dynasty came to power in 202 B.C. They followed the philosophies of Confucianism and legalism. This was called 'the Han synthesis'.

Under this dynasty, China made progress in arts and science. The empire also became larger and larger. China started trading with a number of other countries. They started the Silk Road. Merchants used the Silk Road to reach China. During this dynasty Buddhism was introduced in China. Today, the dominant ethnic group of China calls themselves the Han Chinese since this was the dynasty where many of the norms of Chinese culture found a firm foundation in the culture, including Confucianism and Traditional Chinese characters. The first emperor of the han dynasty is Liu Bang, known in Chinese as Emperor Gaozu of Han.

The Han dynasty ruled China from 206 B.C. to 220 A.D. The new emperor maintained a legalist ideology just like the Qin dynasty but also had ideas of Confucianism to have a centralized system showing benevolence. After eighty years, Emperor Wu of Han launched a period of military expansion.  The Han armies controlled many territories, including Silk Road in Mongolia and Xinjiang.  The Silk Road  helped make a political, economic, military, and culture center, but it was very expensive to manage and further expansion was cut off.  Several factors contributed to the fall of the Han dynasty, including uprisings of desperate and hungry people, the spread of attacks by nomadic groups, and official corruption.

Most of the people of China are Han Chinese.  The name comes from the Han Dynasty. 

[[Zhou Dynasty]]

CATEGORIES: Chinese dynasties

The Zhou Dynasty replaced the Shang Dynasty in 1046 BCE. The kings of this dynasty made the empire a lot bigger. For the first time in the history of China, many people began moving to far away places inside the empire. The Zhou rulers moved the capital from Henan to a place near present-day Xi'an, near the Yellow River. The Zhou Dynasty also brought the theory of the Mandate of Heaven. This theory said that the fact that rulers were in charge proved that the gods wanted them to be in charge. Almost all dynasties of Chinese rulers after the Zhou continued to believe this theory.

Mature Chinese philosophy developed during the Zhou Dynasty. The greatest Chinese philosophers were Kong Fuzi (Latin: Confucius), founder of Confucianism, and Laozi, founder of Daoism. Other philosophers, theorists, and schools of thought from the Zhou Dynasty were Mozi (Latin: Micius), founder of Mohism, Mengzi (Latin: Mencius), a famous Confucian who expanded upon Kong Fuzi's legacy, Shang Yang and Han Feizi, responsible for the development of ancient Chinese Legalism (the core philosophy of the Qin Dynasty), and Xunzi.

[[Tony Iommi]]

CATEGORIES: English guitarists, 1948 births, Living people

Frank Anthony "Tony" Iommi (born 19 February 1948, in Birmingham, England) is an English guitarist and songwriter. He is most famous for starting the heavy metal band Black Sabbath. He is the only person who has stayed a member of the band since it began in 1968. He lost two finger tips in a work accident, and made two fake finger tips from a plastic bottle. This helped give Black Sabbath their heavy sound.

In 2003, Iommi was listed at number 86 in Rolling Stone Magazine's "100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time" issue.

Along with Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin, Iommi is oft considered one of the greatest riff writers of all time.  Iommi used several riffs in Black Sabbath's songs.

In 2006 Tony Iommi was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

[[Yellow River]]

CATEGORIES: Rivers of China

The Yellow River (Huáng Hé 黄河) is the second longest river in China (after Yangtze River) and the sixth longest in the world. The river is 5464 km long and it drains at the Bohai Sea, a gulf of the Yellow Sea. The river is often called the "Mother River of China" and "the Cradle of the Chinese civilization" in China. In Chinese mythology, the river is home to the deity Hebo.

[[Rebellion]]

CATEGORIES: Politics

A rebellion is when people refuse to obey orders and fight against authority. Those who do this are "rebels". They may be citizens of a country who try to take over the government by force because they do not trust the current system. Some rebels in history were slaves who fought back against their masters or against slavery in general. Leader of slave rebellions include Spartacus and Nat Turner.

An example would be the Zhou dynasty in China who made the rulers of other Chinese states that they captured live with their own families in the Zhou capital, Anyang. However, they failed to stop rebellion this way because it brought together groups of lords who might rebel under their control. The Zhou dynasty declined because other lords that were ruling parts of China rebelled.

Rebellion is a usual method of secession.

[[Edward IV of England]]

CATEGORIES: 1442 births, 1483 deaths, House of York, People from Rouen

Edward IV of England was a king of England. He was born on April 28, 1442. He was King of England from March 4, 1461 until his death on April 9, 1483.

Edward was the eldest of the four sons of Richard Plantagenet, Duke of York.  The Duke of York was a very powerful man, and had a claim to the throne of England.  He became more popular than the existing king, Henry VI of England, who was thought to be weak.  When the duke tried to take the throne from Henry VI, the Wars of the Roses broke out.  By the time Edward was eighteen, he and his brother Edmund, Earl of Rutland, who was seventeen, were old enough to take part in the fighting, and Edward turned out to be a very good soldier.  He was helped by Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, a clever nobleman who fought for the Duke of York.  At the Battle of Wakefield in 1460, Edward's father, and his brother Edmund, were both killed.  As his father's heir, he now claimed the throne.  In March 1461, he entered London with his army and was crowned king, although he was only nineteen.  King Henry VI was put into prison.

For a while, Edward ruled the country well, with help from the Earl of Warwick.  Then Edward met a woman called Elizabeth Woodville, whom he wanted to marry.  The Earl of Warwick did not know about their romance, and he wanted King Edward to marry a foreign princess in order to make an alliance with another country, which would have made his position stronger.  Elizabeth and Edward got married secretly in about 1464, and they had ten children in the nineteen years of their marriage.  

When the Earl of Warwick learned of Edward's marriage, he was angry.  He grew even more angry as time went on, because Elizabeth's family became powerful and the king no longer respected Warwick as he had done in the beginning.  In 1459 he rebelled against the king, with help from another of Edward's younger brothers, George, Duke of Clarence; George was married to the Earl of Warwick's elder daughter, Isabel.  The rebels went to France and made an alliance with Queen Margaret, who was the wife of King Henry VI.  The Earl of Warwick managed to defeat King Edward in battle in 1471, and freed King Henry VI from prison.  Henry was now king again, and Edward had to escape to Burgundy, while his wife and children went into hiding.  

The Duke of Burgundy was married to Edward's sister Margaret, so he was willing to help raise more troops.  When Edward returned to England, he defeated the Earl of Warwick in battle and killed him.  Shortly afterwards, Queen Margaret and her son arrived in England.  They were also defeated in battle by King Edward, and his throne was safe.  To make sure of this, Edward arranged for King Henry VI to be killed.

While Edward was away in Burgundy, his wife Elizabeth had given birth to a son, Edward, who was given the title of Prince of Wales.  He would be the next king.  Edward ruled with help from his two brothers.  George, who had once rebelled against him, was now loyal, and the youngest brother, Richard, Duke of Gloucester, had always been loyal.  There were still quarrels between them and the powerful Woodville family.  George and Richard also quarrelled with each other, and in the end King Edward had to put George in prison, where he died.

Edward IV died very suddenly at the age of forty.  His son became King Edward V of England, but his reign did not last long.  Edward's brother, Richard, thought that it would not be a good idea for a boy to be king, and he took the throne himself.  No one really knows what happened to Edward's two sons, the Princes in the Tower.

[[Pterosaur]]

CATEGORIES: Pterosaurs

Pterosaurs were flying reptiles which lived in the Mesozoic era at the same time as the dinosaurs. Many pterosaurs were fairly small, but in the Upper Cretaceous some grew larger than any other flying animals. The pterosaur Quetzalcoatlus had a wing-span of up to 12 metres (~40 feet).

The first fossils occur in the Upper Triassic, and the group continues until the K/T extinction event at the end of the Cretaceous (220 to 65.5 million years ago). Pterosaurs are the earliest vertebrates known to have evolved powered flight. Their wings were made from a flap of skin between their bodies and a big fourth finger (sometimes called the "wing finger"). The pterosaurs fall into two groups. The earlier Rhamphorhynchoids (e.g. Rhamphorhynchus) had long tails and toothed jaws; The pterodactyloids (e.g. Pterodactylus) had short tails, and many had beaks with no teeth.

The first pterosaur fossil was discovered in the Late Jurassic Solnhofen limestone in Germany in 1784. This was exactly the same place as Archaeopteryx was found years later. Georges Cuvier first suggested that pterosaurs were flying creatures in 1801. Since the first pterosaur fossil was found, twenty-nine species of pterosaurs have been found in those deposits alone. A famous early UK find was an example of Dimorphodon by Mary Anning, in 1828 at Lyme Regis, Dorset, England. The name Pterosauria was coined in 1834.

Pterosaurs were genuine fliers, able to flap or soar. Their bodies were covered with fine hairs, so they were able to regulate their temperature (they were warm-blooded). They are a close sister-group to the dinosaurs, part of the Archosauria.

[[Quetzalcoatlus]]

CATEGORIES: Pterosaurs

Quetzalcoatlus  was a huge pterosaur, the largest animal ever to fly. It had a 10 to 12 meters wing-span (33/40 feet), but was light in construction (~200 pounds). 

Quetzalcoatlus had an unusually long neck, and when it stood on the ground it was as tall as a giraffe. 

Its fossil record is from the Upper Cretaceous of North America, 70–65.5 million years ago. Quetzalcoatlus became extinct at the K/T extinction event.

[[Bagel]]

CATEGORIES: Breads, Breakfast foods

Bagels are a type of bread made with flour. They look like doughnuts, and they are leavened with yeast. They have a crisp, shiny crust and a dense inside. Bagels are glazed, and in a ring-shaped roll. They are different from doughnuts because they are boiled before baked. Bagels are sometimes called "the cement doughnuts". 

The bagel is regarded as a special kind of Jewish food. They are eaten usually for breakfast or a snack.

Bagels are made from the basic bread ingredients of flour, yeast, salt, and sweet kinds of spices. Flour gives the bread its chewy taste, which can be made more light by eggs, milk, and butter. They are the only bread product that is boiled before it is baked.

[[Mary II of England]]

CATEGORIES: 1662 births, 1694 deaths, House of Stuart, Princesses of Orange, Kings and Queens of Scotland

Mary II (30 April 1662 – 28 December 1694) was Queen regnant of England, Scotland, and Ireland from 1689 until her death. Mary was a Protestant. She became queen after the Glorious Revolution, which resulted in the deposition of her Roman Catholic father, James II and VII. Mary ruled together with her husband, William III and II. He became the ruler of both countries when she died in 1694. Popular histories usually call their joint reigns as those of "William and Mary". Mary had less power than William when William remained in England. When William went to military campaigns, however, she governed alone. She was a powerful, firm, and effective ruler. She gave most of her authority to her husband, but he greatly depended on her. She was very active in the Church of England, ruling it as its Supreme Governor.

Mary was born at St. James Palace in London on 30 April 1662. Her father was James, Duke of York, and her mother was his first wife, Lady Anne Hyde. She was their oldest daughter. Mary's uncle was Charles II. Her grandfather by her mother's side was Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon. He served for a long time as Charles's chief advisor. Her mother gave birth to eight children, but only Mary and her younger sister Anne lived to adulthood.

The Duke of York became a Roman Catholic in 1668 or 1669, but Mary and Anne had a Protestant education, as Charles II had commanded. Mary's mother died in 1671, and her father married again in 1673. He took Mary of Modena, a Catholic, as his second wife. She was also known as Mary Beatrice d'Este. Before her marriage, Mary wrote many letters to Frances Apsley, the daughter of James II's hawks keeper. However, she did not return Mary's interest.

When she was 15, Lady Mary became betrothed to her first cousin, the Protestant William, Prince of Orange. William was the son of Mary, Princess Royal and Prince William II of Nassau. At first, Charles II did not want Mary to marry William. He wanted Mary to marry the heir to the French Throne, the Dauphin Louis, instead. This was because he hoped that England would become friends with France. He also wanted to have a Catholic successor to the throne. But because of Parliament's pressure, he later approved their marriage. He thought that it would make the Protestants like him more, but he was wrong. Mary and William married in London on 4 November 1677. It was reported that Mary wept through the whole ceremony.

Mary went to the Netherlands and lived there as William's wife. The Dutch people liked her because of her lively, friendly nature, and Mary loved William deeply. However, the marriage was often unhappy. Her three pregnancies ended in miscarriage or stillbirth, and Mary was very sad that she did not have a child. Her husband was often cold to her, and he had an affair with Elizabeth Villiers, one of Mary's ladies-in-waiting, for a long time. After some time, though, he grew warmer towards Mary.

[[Mesopotamia]]

CATEGORIES: Ancient history, Middle East, Mesopotamia

Mesopotamia (Ancient Greek: Μεσοποταμία - "land between rivers") is a historical region in the Middle East. It included most of today’s Iraq, and parts of modern-day Iran, Syria and Turkey. The 'two rivers' of the name referred to the Tigris and the Euphrates rivers. 

The land was called 'Al-Jazirah' ("the island") by the Arabs, and Egyptologist J.H. Breasted later included it in the "Fertile Crescent". The region is bounded in the northeast by the Zagros Mountains and in the southeast by the Arabian Plateau.

The area is often called the "cradle of civilization". The ancient writing called cuneiform was first used around 3000 BC by the Sumerians. Historically important cities in Mesopotamia included Uruk, Ur, Nippur, Nineveh, and Babylon. 

Major territorial states were the Akkadian kingdom, the Third Dynasty of Ur, and the Assyrian Empire. Some of the important historical Mesopotamian leaders were Ur-Nammu (king of Ur), Sargon of Akkad (the founder of the Akkadian kingdom), Hammurabi (who established the Old Babylonian state), and Tiglath-Pileser I (who started the Assyrian Empire).

Many advances in technology were made by the ancient Sumerians, such as irrigation, trade by river, and flood control. Sumerians had agriculture and domesticated animals, or livestock, from the earliest records. Babylon is likely the first city built by settled people. Mesopotamia was also the place where the wheel was first used. First it was a potter's wheel that was used to make clay pots, then Sumerians adapted it for transport.

[[Fir]]

CATEGORIES: Conifers

Firs (Abies) are about 45-55 species of evergreen trees in the family Pinaceae. Fir trees can reach heights of 10–80 m tall and trunk diameters of 0.5–4 m when mature. The difference between firs and other members of the pine family is that their needle-like leaves are attached to the twig by a base that resembles a small suction cup, and by erect, cylindrical female cones 5–25 cm long that release the winged seeds. The male cones are normally much smaller and spread through the tree so that the wind can help pollinate the female cones.

Like all members of the pine family, these trees have a sticky sap called resin.

Fir wood is not good to use in buildings because it is not very resistant to insects and decay. It is usually cut or squeezed into thin sheets or pieces and made into plywood or chipboard for indoor or temporary outdoor use. However, fir trees are used widely in gardening. They can be used as shelter trees to protect other plants from wind or grown alone as decorative trees.

[[Conifer cone]]

CATEGORIES: Conifers

A confier cone (or pine cone) is an organ on plants in the division Pinophyta (conifers) that contains the reproductive structures. It is the part of a tree that lets the tree reproduce. Its formal name in botany is strobilus, plural strobili.

The familiar woody cone is the female cone, which produces seeds. The male cones, which produce pollen, are usually smaller and much less conspicuous even at full maturity. The individual plates of a cone are known as scales.

The male cone (microstrobilus or pollen cone) is structurally similar across all conifers, differing only in small ways (mostly in scale arrangement) from species to species. Extending out from a central axis are microsporophylls (modified leaves). Under each microsporophyll is one or several microsporangia (pollen sacs).

Conifer cones and their seeds have been used for lots of different purposes. They are often used for decorations. Some seeds, for example, the seeds of pinyon pines, are used in prepared foods and baking. 

Most mature cones are closed when wet and open when dry. In a few species, it takes fire to open the cones.

[[Baldur]]

CATEGORIES: Norse gods and goddesses

Baldr (also Balder, Baldur or Baldor) is the god of light and radiance, peace and forgiveness in Norse mythology. A member of the Æsir, he is the son of Odin and Frigg, and twin brother to the blind god of darkness, Höðr. His wife is called Nanna, with whom he had a son named Forseti, god of justice. Prior to his death, Baldr possessed a ship called Hringhorni, said to be the largest ship ever built. His hall is called Breidablik. 

Based on the Merseburg charms, his Germanic name may have been Phol.  

Baldr once had a nightmare that he would be killed. His mother, Frigg, made all the things across the Nine Realms vow not to hurt him. The mistletoe did not vow, however, as Frigg considered it to be so unimportant that she thought nothing of it. Loki found out that the mistletoe had not vowed, and thus made a spear out of the dreaded plant, and tricked Höðr into throwing it at Baldr. Beings from all across the Nine Realms will come to attend his funeral, and Baldr's wife Nanna soon dies of grief. Loki is soon caught and sentenced to punishment; he is bound by the entrails of one of his sons, to face torture as the venom of a massive serpent drips from its fangs onto Loki's eyes. This causes him unimaginable pain, writhing in agony. (The goddess Skaði is responsible for placing the serpent above him). His wife Sigyn is stationed nearby, collecting the drips of venom into a bowl. When the bowl is full, she leaves to empty it, and when she does, the venom drips onto the trickster and gradually eats away at his flesh. Loki's escape from this predicament is the catalyst of Ragnarök, as upon his being freed, he will lead the forces of Jötunheimr and Svartálfheimr in a final assault against the gods. 

During Ragnarök, the veils/barriers between the realms will be broken, so Baldr will be able to escape from Helheimr. After the death of Odin at the fangs of the monstrous wolf Fenrir, Baldr and Höðr came back to life, meeting with the other survivors in the fields of Iðavöllr (Old Norse: Iðavǫllr - "splendour-plain"), where Asgard once lay. There, they shall rule in place of their father.

[[Cell (disambiguation)]]

A cell can mean:

[[Prophecy]]

CATEGORIES: Theology

A prophecy is a claim of what the future will be like, which is not based on any ordinary source of information. In some ways, prophecies are similar to religion. Not all people believe in prophecy. People that do think they come from God or a god. They are often hard to understand and need interpretation. Very often, they concern one very specific event. People who make prophecies are called prophets. In Ancient Greece, people who made prophecies were called oracles, most notably the Oracle of Delphi. Since then, people like Nostradamus have made prophecies. 

To prophesy is to make a prophecy. The two words are spelled differently and pronounced differently. "Prophesy" is a verb, and "prophecy" is a noun.

There are many prophecies in the Bible. Some of these warn of punishments to come.  There are two kinds of Bible prophecies.  Some are conditional, that is, they include the possibility that the punishment can be avoided based on the hearers changing their ways. An example of this is found in the Book of Daniel.  Other prophecies are unconditional.  That means that the event will happen no matter what the hearers do to avoid it. There are also Bible prophecies that tell of future blessings.  Blessings are good things that happen because of God's mercy and forgiveness. Some prophecies contain both punishment and blessings.  Jesus made prophecies like this, warning people to believe in Him and live right, to get the blessing instead of the punishment. While some of the prophecies in the bible about future events are hard to understand, the moral warnings from Jesus are not hard to understand.  For this reason, some preachers, like Moses, Jesus and other religious leaders who tell people to live a good life are called prophets by their followers even though they may not tell about future events. Muslims consider Muhammad to be a prophet. Even some modern religious leaders have been called prophets by their followers, such as Joseph Smith, Jr., Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and Rev. Billy Graham.

[[Ornithomimus]]

CATEGORIES: Coelurosaurs, Cretaceous dinosaurs

Ornithomimus was a lightly built fast-running North American feathered dinosaur. 

Ornithomimus had three toes on each foot, long arms and  neck, but a small head. It also had claws on each hand and foot. It had no teeth and weak jaws, which might mean it was omnivorous.

Ornithomimus edmonticus was the largest species, 12 ft (3.5 meters) long, 7 feet (2.10 meters) high and weighed about 100-150 kg. It walked on two legs and looked slightly like an ostrich, except for its long tail. 

There has been trouble with naming. Some speciments are put in other genera, like Dromiceiomimus and Struthiomimus.

[[Abide with Me]]

CATEGORIES: 19th century songs, Christian hymns

Abide with Me is a religious song or hymn. It was written by Henry Lyte in 1847. The hymn was sung at the wedding of King George VI of the United Kingdom and the wedding of Queen Elizabeth II. The song is sung at the start of the FA Cup finals.

[[Hail Mary]]

CATEGORIES: Christian prayers, Mary (mother of Jesus)

Hail Mary is a Christian prayer to Mary, the mother of Jesus. Most of the prayer comes from the Gospel of Luke. Some things were also added to the prayer during the 13th century (the 1200s). When a person says a Hail Mary, he asks Mary to pray for him.

In Roman Catholicism, the Hail Mary makes up the most important part of the Rosary. The Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox also use the prayer. So do many other groups within Christianity, including Anglicans, Independent Catholics, and Old Catholics. Some Protestant denominations also use the Hail Mary. 

[[Studio]]

CATEGORIES: Art, Buildings and structures

A studio is a place where an artist can work. Studios can be used for many things, such as photography, broadcasting, painting, making movies, television shows, cartoons, or music. The word comes from the Latin word, studium, which means to study. 

[[Electric Light Orchestra]]

CATEGORIES: English rock bands

The Electric Light Orchestra, also known as ELO, were a popular English rock band from the 1970s and early 1980s. Their leader was musician and songwriter Jeff Lynne. Lynne wrote and sang most of their songs. He also produced their recordings. Other members included Richard Tandy on keyboards, Bev Bevan on drums, Mike D'Albuquerque and later Kelly Groucutt on bass guitar. Hugh McDowell, Mik Kaminski, and Melvyn Gale played violin and cello. The orchestra's name is a joke on "electric light" and a "Light Orchestra" (an orchestra that plays light music).

[[Vicious]]

The word vicious has several meanings:

[[Ash]]

The term Ash can have different meanings:

[[Ash tree]]

CATEGORIES: Trees, Oleaceae

Ash trees are medium to large trees of the genus Fraxinus of the family Oleaceae (Olive-tree like). The family contains between 45 and 65 species. Some of them are evergreen, but most are deciduous. They grow in most parts of the world. The seeds are commonly known as keys in English. They are a type of fruit known as a samara. Most of the ash species have light-green, oval shaped, pinnate leaves. The central stem of the compound leaf has 9 – 13 leaflets (small leaves) in pairs, with one at the tip. There are no stalks to the side leaflets. The leaflets are pointed and toothed, with hairs on the lower surface. The leaves appear relatively late in spring, and are amongst the first to be shed in autumn.

The buds are black, sooty or velvety in appearance and are sometimes compared to a Bishop’s Mitre in shape.

Ash wood is used to make various tools, handles, baseball and softball bats and bows. It also makes very good firewood. Ash trees are also perfect material for old fashion shafts for bow and arrows.

In Norse Mythology, the world tree Yggdrasil is commonly thought to be an ash tree. The first man, Askr, was formed from an ash. The first woman was made from an alder. 

[[Ash Wednesday]]

CATEGORIES: Christian holidays

Ash Wednesday is the first day of Lent in the Western Christian calendar. It occurs 46 days before Easter. The date is different each year because the date of Easter varies. It can fall as early as February 4 and as late as March 10. 

Those able to and willing to should fast voluntarily between Ash Wednesday and Easter. There are exceptions, though. Pregnant women, sick people, children, and the old usually don't have to. 

Ash Wednesday is a very important part of Lent.

[[Valkyrie]]

CATEGORIES: Norse mythology

The Valkyries (Old Norse: Valkyrjur, singular valkyrja - “choosers of the slain”) are a host of female figures in Norse mythology; they are a group of warrior maidens in service to the chief god Odin. Fierce and respected warriors, they are responsible for choosing who live and die in battle, singling out those worthy of paradise. In the aftermath of battle, the Valkyries carry those whom they have chosen off to Valhalla, an enormous and majestic hall that lies in Asgard. Once there, these eïnherjar, as they are now called, are shared between Odin and Freyja, with half of them going to Valhalla and the other to Fólkvangr, Freyja's realm. In Valhalla, the eïnherjar feast and make revelry, as they are served and cared for by the Valkyries themselves. 

The old Norse people thought that Valkyries rode giant wolves, and that they had black wings which correspond to ravens; these two creatures both scavenge corpses on the battlefield symbolizing death and destruction. With the spread of Christianity the idea of what a Valkyrie was like changed more and more to a  Romantic description of a beautiful woman. 

Richard Wagner composed some operas, featuring Valkyries (German: Walküren, singular: Walküre). These operas are Die Walküre, Siegfried, and Götterdämmerung. They feature a story of a valkyrie Brünnhilde, her punishment for disobeying her father, and her falling in love with Siegfried.  The music for the opening of Act Three of Die Walküre is very famous.  It is called the Ride of the Valkyries.

[[Zosterops]]

CATEGORIES: Passeriformes

Zosterops is a type of bird. There are many different species of Zosterops around the world.

[[Dimorphodon]]

CATEGORIES: Pterosaurs

Dimorphodon was a prehistoric flying pterosaur from the early Jurassic period. It had a big head, a small brain, a tall beak, and two types of teeth. Variation in teeth is rare in pterosaurs. 

Like Rhamphorhynchus, Dimorphodon is only found in Jurassic strata. It was the first pterosaur found in England, by Mary Anning, in 1828.

[[Cryolophosaurus]]

CATEGORIES: Tetanurans

Cryolophosaurus is a theropod dinosaur from the Lower Jurassic period. It is the only theropod to be found in Antarctica. Cryolophosaurus was discovered in the Jurassic Hanson Formation in the Transantarctic Mountains. The find of this dinosaur was significant because it proves that the dinosaurs lived on all  continents and that high latitude climates were tolerated by dinosaurs at that time.

Cryolophosaurus is also significant because it is the oldest known tetanuran from any continent: it is the only one from the early Jurassic.

Cryolophosaurus had a large crest on the top of the skull, above the eyes. It extends upwards from the skull.

Cryolophosaurus was found about 650 from the South Pole but then it was about 1000 or so farther north. Also found were the remains of Glacialisaurus (a large basal sauropodomorph), a crow-sized pterosaur, synapsids, and another unknown theropod. There are also the remains of many plant genera around the same age as fossils of Cryolophosaurus, proving that dense plant matter had once grown on Antarctica's surface before it drifted southward.

[[Coloborhynchus]]

CATEGORIES: Pterosaurs

Coloborhynchus was a pterosaur. It has been found in Lower Cretaceous rocks in England and Brazil. It is a similar genus to Anhanguera and Ornithocheirus.

The type specimen of Coloborhynchus is known only from a partial upper jaw. It can only be distinguished from its relatives by its unique combination of tooth socket positions. In Coloborhynchus, the two front teeth pointed forward and were higher on the jaw than the other teeth, while the next three pairs of teeth pointed to the sides. The final two pairs of teeth in this specimen point downward. Finally, a unique oval depression was located below the first pair of teeth.

The possible species Coloborhynchus capito is the largest toothed pterosaur known. A specimen from the Cambridge Greensand has a very large upper jaw tip which displays the typical teeth which distinguish C. capito from other species. The jaw tip is nearly 10 cm tall and 5.6 cm wide, with teeth up to 1.3 cm in base diameter. If the proportions of this specimen was the same as other known species of Coloborhycnhus, the total skull length could have been up to 75 cm, leading to an estimated wingspan of 7.

[[Alder]]

CATEGORIES: Trees, Betulaceae

Alder is the common name for about 30 kinds of trees and shrubs of the Alnus genus. They are a part of the birch family (Betulaceae). Most of them are smaller in size. Leaves are mostly deciduous, only very few alders are evergreen.

Alder trees are found in all parts of the northern hemisphere and they are often found on poor and/or wet soil. Alders have alternate simple leaves with a toothed edge. The male flowers are in the form of hanging catkins and the female flowers are much smaller catkin-like structures (see image). The pollen is transferred from the male to the female flower by the wind. The female flower parts develop into little, green, rounded cone-like fruits which turn brown in autumn and open to release the seeds. 

The best known species are the Black Alder, which can be seen throughout Europe. The largest is probably the Red Alder, native to North America. It reaches about 32–35 metres in height. The widespread Green Alder is a shrub, rarely more than 5m high. The commonest alder in the UK is the Black Alder, also called the Common Alder or European Alder.  

Alder is a preferred tree for bees, especially in spring. It is also used to make charcoal. 

[[Futabasaurus]]

CATEGORIES: Plesiosaurs

Futabasaurus was a plesiosaur from the Upper Cretaceous. A complete skeleton of one has not been found. It is not known very well. 

Futabasaurus is the first elasmosaurid found in Japan. The type species is F. suzukii.  Many of the bones of the type specimen show apparent scavenging or predation by sharks.

[[Ovum]]

CATEGORIES: Biological reproduction, Female reproductive system

An ovum (Latin: "egg", plural: ova) is the name for the haploid female reproductive cell, or gamete. Both animals and land plants (embryophytes) produce ova. 

[[Ovule]]

CATEGORIES: Plant anatomy, Botany, Flowers

Ovules produce the female reproductive cells which get fertilized during sexual reproduction in seed plants. The word literally means "small egg."

The megagametophyte (also called the embryo sac in flowering plants) is inside the ovule. The megagametophyte produces the egg cell.

[[Horn (musical instrument)]]

CATEGORIES: Brass instruments

The horn is a brass instrument.  It developed from the horns that some animals have on their heads.  Modern horns are often called French horns.

[[Valhalla]]

CATEGORIES: Places in Norse mythology, Afterlife

In Norse mythology, Valhalla (Old Norse: Valhöll - “hall of the slain”) is an enormous and majestic hall in Asgard, headed by Odin. Described as a "warrior's paradise," it is here that the souls of those who are slain in battle go, chosen and guided by the Valkyries, a group of warrior maidens in service to Odin. Once they are there, these eïnherjar, as they are known, make revelry, as they feast on the beast known as Sæhrímnir, having their fill of mead made from the udders of the female goat Heiðrún. The feast is prepared by Andhrímnir (Old Norse: “the one exposed to soot”), the cook of the gods, in his cauldron, Eldhrímnir (Old Norse: “fire-sooty”). Outside of Valhalla’s doors lies Glasir (Old Norse: “gleaming”), a massive tree that grows golden leaves, while its ceiling is adorned with golden shields. The tree Læraðr stands atop the great hall, where both Heiðrún and the stag Eikþyrnir (Old Norse: “oak-thorny”) graze its foliage. During Ragnarök, the eïnherjar will aid Odin in his battle against Surtr and his forces.  

[[Horn (anatomy)]]

CATEGORIES: Animal anatomy

Horns are part of the body of some animals. They grow on the animal's head. They are projections (things that stick out) made of hard skin. The horn has a lot of keratin in it, the same protein that is in human hair and nails. 

Normally horned animals will have two horns, but the rhinoceros has just one horn in the middle of its head.

Animals often use their horns for fighting one another.

Thousands of years ago people used the horns of dead animals for musical instruments (see horn (postal horn)). In later times, they were used for carrying gunpowder.

[[Mead]]

CATEGORIES: Fermented drinks

Mead is a fermented alcoholic drink. It is made from honey. Its history is possibly as old as that of beer. It is made by mixing honey, water, and yeast.  Some kinds of mead also include spices or fruit. Mead is sometimes called "honey wine".

Archaeologists discovered that people made mead 9,000 years ago.  Mead was described in the Rigveda, which is a Hindu religious text. Mead is popular in Central Europe and the Balkans. Mead is also made in Ethiopia and South Africa.

[[Ull]]

CATEGORIES: Norse gods and goddesses

In Norse mythology, Ull (or Ullr or Uller) is the son of Sif, and the stepson of Thor. He is thought to be the god of Winter, of hunting, of hand-to-hand combat, and of the willow tree. His name means "glory". He was said to be a great archer and skier who left blazing trails across the sky. 

For this reason he is celebrated in modern times as the god of skiing. His name is used as a name for ski lodges like the House of Ullr at Thredbo, New South Wales. ULLR Labs make smartphone applications to help people avoid avalanches.

[[Thrud]]

CATEGORIES: Norse gods and goddesses

Þrúðr, sometimes written as Thrúd, is a daughter of the gods Sif and Thor in Norse mythology. Although her name is mentioned in the Prose Edda, it gives no direct powers or other information about her. Thrúd is also one of the valkyries described in Grímnismál (stanza 36). Thrúd is the goddess of power, of trees, flowers and the grass. Her name means strength in Old Norse.

[[Hugin and Munin]]

CATEGORIES: Norse mythology

Hugin and Munin are two ravens, commonly associated with Odin. They bring Odin news from the world, when he sends them out. Their names translate as thought and memory, respectively.

[[Hel (goddess)]]

CATEGORIES: Norse gods and goddesses, Afterlife

Hel is a goddess of Norse mythology. Her father is Loki, and her mother is Angrboða, a giantess. Her siblings are Jörmungandr and Fenrir. Her task is to reign over the realm of the dead, also called Hel or Neifelheim, where the dead peacefully go to in the afterlife to wait until Ragnarok, the end of the gods and Asgard. The people who go there are those who did not die in battle, but instead died a peaceful death. She watches over those who die, but are not chosen by the Valkyries to go to Valhalla or chosen by Freyja to enter her household.  

Hel is half dead and half alive due to complications of her father and her mother. Half of her face is beautiful, like that of her father, while the other half is ugly and difficult to look at like her mother. From the waist up the skin is pink, alive and healthy. Below the waist is dead and rotting. This is the personification of the belief that death can be a good thing or a tragedy. Hel's underworld is not the Christian hell of eternal punishment for all, but a world of rewards or punishment for each as earned in life.

[[Runestone]]

CATEGORIES: Norse mythology

A Runestone or Rune stone is a large stone, with runes inscribed on it, dating from the early Middle Ages. Currently, about 6000 such stones are known to exist in Scandinavia. About half of them date from the tenth and eleventh century, and were found in Sweden. Most of them are like grave stones. They announce the life and death of a local person. About 10 percent of the known stones tell about the travels and deaths of persons abroad. Some of these texts are similar to what Scandinavians who travelled to Byzantium have written in Latin.

[[Balcony]]

CATEGORIES: Architectural elements

A balcony is a kind of floor at a certain height, which stands out from the building. Usually, there is some kind of balustrade so people do not fall off.

There is a possibility to protect the balcony with a glazing. So called balcony glazings are important for certain areas that are heavily influenced by weather or noise. Assemblers, which create designs and static evaluation for the balcony glazing, are necessary to integrate the glazing conform with regulations and laws. Because if the glazing is assembled in the wrong way, parts could fall off and damage property or persons.

Unlike a terrace, balconies and also their balustrade need a static evaluation, so they don't take damage over time and can permanentely hold their visitors.

[[Bergstraße Route]]

CATEGORIES: Baden-Württemberg, Hesse

Bergstraße ("Mountain Road") is the name of a mountain route, and the area around it, which stretches across the western edge of the Odenwald in southern Hesse and northern Baden-Württemberg, Germany. 

The name "Bergstraße" also refers to the district Kreis Bergstraße, the independent wine-growing region of Hessische Bergstraße and the Badische Bergstraße in the Baden wine-growing area.

[[Caucasus]]

CATEGORIES: Caucasus, Ottoman Empire

The Caucasus or Caucasia is a region in Eurasia bordered on the south by Iran, on the southwest by Turkey, on the west by the Black Sea, on the east by the Caspian Sea, and on the north by Russia.  The Persian name for the region is Qafqâz.  Caucasia includes the Caucasus Mountains and surrounding lowlands.  

The Caucasus Mountains are commonly known as a line between Asia and Europe, and the lands in Caucasia are different considered to be in one or both continents.  The northern portion of the Caucasus is known as the Ciscaucasus and the southern portion as the Transcaucasus.  The highest peak in the Caucasus is Mount Elbrus (5,642 m) which, in the western Ciscaucasus in Russia, is generally considered the highest point in Europe.

[[Hamidian massacres]]

CATEGORIES: Anti-Armenianism, Massacres in Turkey, Armenian Genocide

The Hamidian massacres took place around 1895 until 1897. The estimated number of Armenians killed are around 100,000 - 300,000.

These events are known by the Armenians as the "Great Massacres". The Armenians believed the Hamidian measures showed the extension of the Turkish state to do a systematic policy of murder and plunder against a small population. The Armenian revolutionary groups started around the end of the Russo-Turkish War of 1878 and grew with the first introduction of Article 166 of the Ottoman Penal code 166, and the raid of Erzerum Cathedral. 

Article 166 was meant to control the possession of arms, but it was used to target Armenians by not letting them possess arms. Local Kurdish tribes were armed to attack the defenselessFebruary 2011 Armenian population. Some diplomats said that the aim of these groups was to commit massacres so as to show counter-measures, and to invite "foreign powers to intervene," as Istanbul's British Ambassador Sir Philip Currie seen in March 1894.February 2011 Even some Turkish authors admit the that this was just a pretext for the massacres.February 2011

[[Automobiles of the 1920s]]

CATEGORIES: 1920s automobiles

Automobiles have changed considerably since 1893 due to the more efficient ways for new cars to be developed and designed. The car industry was thriving in the 1920s. There were many new types of cars. In the beginning of the 1920s many of the soldiers returning from World War I bought automobiles. People started to see that having a car would make traveling much easier. Soon almost every American family had a car. Ford was the big car maker but other companies were also big at the time. Ford cars, such as the Ford Model T, were popular because they were cheap  and very reliable. When new Ford models came out people would always get the newer version.

The automobiles industry in Europe and the United States expanded greatly during the 1920s. There were many changes in the industry and new types of cars. Having a car allowed families and individuals to travel more easily. Famous cars of the 1920s included:

[[Norns]]

CATEGORIES: Norse mythology

The Norns are female deities in Norse mythology who govern fate. Their names are Urd (what has been), Verdandi (what is) and Skuld (what is to come). Skuld is also the name of a Valkyrie.

The Norns are at the base of the ash tree Yggdrasil (or, according to some versions, above the Bifröst bridge). They spin threads and weave the tapestry of fates.  Each person's life is a thread in their loom. The length of the thread is the length of the person's life. Even the gods have their threads and are therefore not immortal, though the Norns hide the strings from the gods.  So everything is set out beforehand.  There is no luck, there is no randomness, everything is determined by destiny.

The Greeks called deities similar to the Norns Moirae, and the Romans called them Parcae.

The three Norns appear at the beginning of Richard Wagner's opera Götterdämmerung and foretell the downfall of the gods when a thread of fate breaks.

[[Liopleurodon]]

CATEGORIES: Plesiosaurs

Liopleurodon was a large species of Pliosaur. It was an apex predator in the Upper Jurassic seas, around 160–155 million years ago. It grew up to 6.39 metres (21 feet) long. It was a relative of Pliosaurus and Kronosaurus. It preyed on other marine animals such as Ophthalmosaurus.

Some fossil remains excavated from the Kimmeridge Clay formation in England indicate a much larger animal, perhaps up to 15 long. However, these have not been put in the genus Liopleurodon. 

Liopleurodon's nose allowed it to smell underwater. It could smell prey from some distance away. Despite needing to breath air, Liopleurodon spent its entire life at sea and was unable to leave the water. Consequently, it would have given birth to its young alive and may have visited shallower water to breed.

[[Libonectes]]

CATEGORIES: Plesiosaurs, Fossils

Libonectes was a plesiosaur related to Elasmosaurus. It lived 80 to 65 million years ago. It grew up to 12 metres long. It was a predator of small fish; the fish ate plankton in the upper pelagic layers of the sea.

[[Dimetrodon]]

CATEGORIES: Pelycosaurs

Dimetrodon was a pelycosaur (early Synapsida) from the first part of the Permian period (about 295–272 million years ago). 

Dimetrodon walked on four legs and had a tall, curved skull with large teeth of different sizes set along the jaws. Most fossils have been found in the southwestern United States, from red beds in Texas and Oklahoma. The largest known species of Dimetrodon is D. angelensis at 4.6 and the smallest is D. teutonis at 60.

Dimetrodon was a carnivore, probably the top predator in its environment. Its main feature is the large sail on its back formed by elongated spines extending upwards from the vertebrae. The spines would be joined by skin. The general opinion of palaeontologists is that it was a temperature-regulating device. The idea is that the animal could warm up in the early morning by placing itself broadside to the Sun, and later could cool off in the shade, or arrange for its body to get less sunlight. At this stage in evolution, no land animals were homoiotherms. Very likely the sail was also used for sexual or territorial signalling. In which case, the skin would be coloured. This, of course, is supposition, but it does make sense of the animal's most extraordinary feature.

In evolutionary terms, Dimetrodon was a synapsid, a line of land animals which eventually gave rise to the mammals. It was not on the direct line of descent, but a good example of the evolutionary grade typical of Permian synapsids.

[[Spinosaurus]]

CATEGORIES: Spinosauridae, Dinosaurs of Africa, Cretaceous dinosaurs

Spinosaurus (which means 'spiny lizard') was a huge semi-aquatic dinosaur from the Cretaceous, 112 to 93.5 million years ago. It had paddle-like feet and nostrils on top of its crocodile-like head. This would let it submerge as a crocodile does.

The same research suggests it was perhaps larger than Tyrannosaurus rex, but more clumsy on land, moving as a quadruped. All these ideas had been suggested before. The discovery of a more complete skeleton made palaeontologists think they were correct. The fossil was found in Morocco by a private collector who let scientists examine it.

Spinosaurus bones were first discovered in Egypt in 1912 by German paleontologist Ernst Stromer in 1915. Two species, S. aegyptiacus and S. marocannus, are recognized by many paleontologists, but there may only be one. Spinosaurus looked like Baryonyx except it was larger and more heavily built. Six specimens of Spinosaurus have been uncovered. Apparently, good material was destroyed in Munich in a 1944 bombing raid.

[[Anhanguera]]

CATEGORIES: Pterosaurs

Anhanguera, which means 'Old Devil', was a pterodactyl from the Upper Cretaceous. It was found in the Santana Formation of Brazil, and specimens from England are also placed in this genus. 

It ate fish and grew to 14 feet (4.5 meters) across. The species Anhanguera piscator is now placed in the genus Coloborhynchus.

[[Rhamphorhynchus]]

CATEGORIES: Pterosaurs

Rhamphorhynchus is a genus of long-tailed pterosaurs in the Upper Jurassic. It is the best-known of the long-tailed pterosaurs, the sub-order Rhamphorynchoidea. 

Rhamphorhynchus had a long tail, stiffened with ligaments, which ended in a small diamond-shaped rudder on the end of its tail which helped keep it stable when it was flying.

The jaws of Rhamphorhynchus housed needle-like teeth, which were angled forward, with a curved, sharp, beak-like tip lacking teeth. Their diet was mainly fish and insects.

Like other pterosaurs, its body was covered with hairs, which suggests it had termperature regulation ('hot-blooded') and a high rate of metabolism. This is also found in birds and bats, and seems necessary for active flight.

The genus was quite successful: it is the most common pterosaur found in the Solnhofen limestone beds in Bavaria, Germany. These are the same strata where Archaeopteryx was found.

[[Zhejiangopterus]]

CATEGORIES: Pterosaurs

Zhejiangopterus is a pterosaur that was found in China. It lived in the late Cretaceous. 

At least six specimens of adults have been found. Zhejiangopterus was a moderately large pterosaur. Its wingspan was first estimated at five metres (16.4 feet). Later estimates reduced this to about 3.5 metres (11 feet). 

Its skull was long, low, perfectly arched, and lacked a "keel" or any other crest sometimes seen in related species. The beak was long, thin, sharply pointed, and lacked teeth. The cervical vertebrae were elongated. The first six dorsal vertebrae had fused together. This helped the chest keep stable against the forces generated by the wings.

Several pairs of belly ribs were preserved. Its upper leg bone was half the size of its upper arm bone, and strong and thin. The wings were short but robust

[[Tupuxuara]]

CATEGORIES: Pterosaurs

Tupuxuara was a pterosaur that lived 112 million years ago. It was found in the Santana Formation, the remains of an inland sea. 

Some species were quite small, but the largest skull (length 130 cms) suggests a wingspan of 5.5 metres. It was an Azdarchid pterosaur, the same group as  Quetzalcoatlus.

[[Anurognathus]]

CATEGORIES: Pterosaurs

Anurognathus was a genus of small rhamphorhynchoid pterosaurs which lived 150 million years ago, in the Upper Jurassic period. It had a short head with pin-like teeth for catching insects. It was found in the Solnhofen limestone, the same place as Archaeopteryx. They grew up to 35 cms wingspan.

Although it is in the long-tailed pterosaur group Rhamphorhynchoidea, its tail was comparatively short. This was an adaptation which made it more manoeuvrable in hunting. According to Döderlein the reduced tail of Anurognathus was similar to the pygostyle of modern birds. 

With an estimated wingspan of fifty centimetres (20 inches) and a nine centimetre long body (skull included), its weight was limited: forty grammes for a specimen with a 35 centimetre wingspan.  

Later a second, smaller, specimen was found, probably of a subadult individual. Its slab and counterslab are separated and both were sold to private collections. This second fossil is more complete and better articulated. It shows impressions of a large part of the flight membrane and under UV-light remains of the muscles of the thigh and arm become visible. It provided new information on many points of the anatomy. The skull was shown to have been very short and broad, wider than long.

[[Tantalus]]

CATEGORIES: People in Greek mythology

Tantalus was a mortal king in Greek mythology. He did many bad things against the gods and goddesses. At a banquet, he tried to feed people the flesh of his son Pelops. He had asked the gods and goddesses to come to this banquet. When they learn what he had planned, they punished Tantalus in not only this world (the world of the living), but the next as well (the world of the dead). Tantalus's punishment while he was alive was the ruin of his kingdom. His punishment when dead in the Tartaros of the Underworld was much worse.

He was made to stand in a pool of water up to his chin for all time. During this, he would always be hungry and thirsty. Each time Tantalus lowered his head to drink the water he was standing in, the water would lower. Over his head hung branches of trees filled with fruit. When he would try to get them, wind would blow them out of his reach. He was "tantalized" with food and drink. This is where the word tantalize comes from.

His daughter is Niobe. And his son, Pelops, was made alive again by the gods. He went to Greece and became the ruler of the peninsula which still has his name, the Peloponesus.

[[Bushido]]

CATEGORIES: History of Japan, Samurai

Manco Cápac (died in 1107) was the first of the fourteen Inca rulers of Peru. He started the Inca empire. 

As he says it, his legend started at the waters of Lake Titicaca, when he was told by the sun god to go East to set up his empire. As they walked looking for a good place, Manco taught men to farm, hunt, and fish while Mama Ocllo, his wife taught women to work with wool and cotton. Near Cusco, as his sacred golden staff sank in the ground, Manco decided this was to be the capital city of his empire.

[[Vivien Leigh]]

CATEGORIES: Deaths from tuberculosis, English movie actors, English stage actors, Infectious disease deaths in London, People of British India, People with bipolar disorder, 1913 births, 1967 deaths

Vivien Leigh (5 November 1913 – 7 July 1967) was an English actress. She is best known for playing Scarlett O'Hara in Gone with the Wind in 1939, and Blanche DuBois in A Streetcar Named Desire in 1951. Leigh won Academy Awards for both of these roles.

Leigh was born in Darjeeling, Bengal, British India. She was married to Laurence Olivier from 1940-1960 and often acted in plays and movies with him. Olivier was Leigh's second husband. The first was Leigh Holman, and Miss Leigh was still legally married to him when she came to the US to accompany Laurence Olivier who came to Hollywood to star in David O. Selznick's production of "Rebecca" directed by Alfred Hitchcock. It was lucky that Miss Leigh's agent just happened to be David O. Selznick's brother, Myron. Miss Leigh wrote long letters to her husband then during the shooting of GWTW, complaining about the script, the change of director from George Cukor to Victor Fleming. The change was made at the insistence of Clark Gable, who felt that Cukor was devoting too much time and attention to directing Miss Leigh and her co-star, Olivia de Havilland. Miss Leigh also complained in her letters of Gable's bad breath due to his dentures.

When her divorce was final, she married Olivier (she referred to him as her husband until she died, although they had been divorced for many years). Leigh believed that Olivier was the best actor of his (or any) generation, and worked very hard to be worthy of acting with him - on stage, of course. Leigh believed, as did Olivier, that the only place "real" acting took place was on the stage. Her movie career reflects her lack of enthusiasm for that medium, concentrating instead on acting with Lord Olivier in live theatre. Many critics, however, did not feel that she had the "presence" and vocal prowess that Olivier possessed and her reviews were often (perhaps unfairly) negatively compared to her husband.

Leigh was considered to be beautiful and this sometimes meant that she thought that she was not taken seriously as an actress. However her ill health was often a bigger problem. Leigh suffered from bipolar disorder and often had tuberculosis. These meant that her career went through period of decline and that she was sometimes considered difficult to work with. She died of tuberculosis in London.

[[Sacred Heart]]

CATEGORIES: Christian prayers

The prayer to the Sacred Heart of Jesus is a Roman Catholic devotion. A devotion is something that people do or say to show their love for God and Jesus. Saint Margaret Mary Alacoque wrote the prayer. When Roman Catholics pray to the Sacred Heart of Jesus they are praying for a part of Jesus that they believe is divine. The devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus  is also popular among some Anglo-Catholic Anglicans (Anglicans who use many of the same practices as Catholics).

[[Marian Prayer]]

CATEGORIES: Christian prayers

Marian prayers or Marian devotions are acts of asking for the intercession of the Mary, the mother of Jesus. It is mainly something done by Roman Catholics but it is also used by Anglo-Catholics. Marian prayer is not worship. It is asking Mary to pray, or intercede for you and/or other people. When asking for Mary's intercession, you are honouring her and not worshipping her. It is to ask her to help you communicate better with her son, Jesus. They do believe she was created perfect, or without sin. They are still following the second commandment, because they are not worshipping, only asking for intercession in their lives. Many novenas and prayers can be said in her honour. 

There are in fact many common ways in doing so but there is a simplistic yet symbolical prayer called the rosary, the reciting pray for the intervening of mother Mary. This is said in honour and praise of her as well as to ask of her help. Another example is yet commonly said during the rosary itself and is called the "hail holy queen".

[[Troodon]]

CATEGORIES: Theropods, Cretaceous dinosaurs

Troodon (or Troödon) is an genus of relatively small, bird-like dinosaurs, from the later part of the Cretaceous period, 75–65 million years ago. The alternate spelling Troödon shows that the os are pronounced separately, as in 'zoology'.

They were probably carnivorous, but details of their teeth are a bit unusual. Some experts suggest they may have included plant material in their diet, but this is not a majority view.

Discovered in central Montana in 1855, it was among the first dinosaurs found in North America. Its species ranged widely, with fossil remains recovered from as far north as Alaska, and the Judith River formation of Alberta, and as far south as Wyoming and even possibly Texas and New Mexico.

Troodon had a large brain in proportion to its body weight. It had a sickle claw, an enlarged and retractable second toe claw bone. Troodon had 122 teeth. The size and shape of the leg bones show that the Troodon would have been a fast runner. 

The view that Troodon was a predator is supported by its sickle claw on the foot and apparently good binocular vision.

Troodons size ranged widely. In general, individuals that lived further north were larger than those that lived in more southern areas. Troodons in Alaska were especially large, up to 12 feet long, 5 feet tall, and weighing up to 175 pounds. Meanwhile, Troodons that lived in more southern locations were only around 7 feet long, 3 feet tall, and weighed up to 50 pounds, about the size of a Velociraptor. Very likely Troodon had feathers, but no fossil evidence for feathers has yet been found.

There has been a lot of debate about which specimens, all very incomplete, should be called Troodon. The genus now includes specimens previously classified as Stenonychosaurus.

Troodon nests full of eggs have been found in Montana. When scientists CAT-scanned them, they found baby Troodon skeleton embryos inside of them. They found skeletons of a small plant-eating dinosaur named Orodromeus with the eggs, as well as a skeleton of an adult Troodon. At first, it was believed that the eggs had belonged to the Orodromeus, and that the Troodon was there intending to rob the nest.

However, it was later discovered that the eggs belonged to the Troodon when baby Troodon embryos were found inside the eggs. It is now believed that the adults had killed the Orodromeus and brought them back to feed their babies. Troodons laid up to 24 eggs in their nests which were earth mounds. They were able to lay two eggs at a time, so large clutches would take two weeks to lay.

A 2017 description had redeemed the validity of Stenonychosaurus and had created a new genus from separate bones naming them Lateniventrix, limiting Troodon to a few teeth. 

[[Saurornithoides]]

CATEGORIES: Theropods, Cretaceous dinosaurs

Saurornithoides was a fast running dinosaur from 79 million years ago. It was related to Troodon. Its fossils have been found in Mongolia and China. 

Like its cousin Troodon, Saurornithoides was an intelligent predator, with large eyes and good vision. It had a retractable, sickle-shaped claw on the second claw of each foot that was used for attacking prey. Saurornithoides probably fed on small prey, such as lizards, frogs, insects, and small mammals. It may also have hunted in packs to bring down other dinosaurs. Saurornithoides was discovered in the Gobi Desert on an expedition in the 1920s. The dinosaurs Velociraptor, Protoceratops, and Oviraptor were also discovered during these expeditions to the Gobi Desert.

[[Siegfried]]

CATEGORIES: Fictional characters

Sigurd (Old Norse: Sigurðr) is a strong hero in the Nibelungenlied, a epic poem written about the year 1200. He killed the dragon Fafnir and took its treasure, the Nibelungenschatz. After killing the dragon, he bathed in its blood and so changed his skin, so that he could not be wounded any more. The earliest extant representations for his legend come in pictorial form from seven runestones in Sweden and most notably the Ramsund carving (c. 1000) and the Gök Runestone (11th century).

But a leaf fell from a linden tree above while he was bathing and landed on his back, and the little patch of skin that it covered did not touch the dragon's blood, so that Siegfried remained vulnerable (he could be hurt) in that one spot.

Siegfried wants to marry Kriemhild, the sister of Gunther, kin of the Burgundians in Worms. But before he is allowed to marry her he has to help Gunther to win against Brünhild, the queen of Iceland. He does it with the help of a cloak which lets him become invisible.

After their marriage Siegfried and Kriemhild live in Siegfried's kingdom for some years. Then they come to visit Worms and Kriemhild's family again. Brünhild, the wife of Gunther, and

Kriemhild argue about who is of higher rank. Now Kriemhild tells Brünhild that Siegfried helped Gunther in his fight against her and that he gave a proof of this victory to Kriemhild. Therefore, Brünhild becomes so furious that she decides that Siegfried must be killed. This is done by Hagen, one of Gunther's men, while Siegfried is drinking from a well during a hunt in the Odenwald. Hagen also takes the treasure of Siegfried from Kriemhild and throws it into the Rhine.

The name Siegfried in German means "victory peace".

Siegfried appears in two of the four operas in Wagner's Ring cycle: the third opera is called Siegfried and the fourth one is called Götterdämmerung although originally Wagner called it "Siegfrieds Tod" ("The Death of Siegfried"). Wagner makes several changes to the story.

James II and VII (14 October 1633 – 16 September 1701) was king of England, Scotland, and Ireland from 1685 to 1688. He was King James II in England and Ireland, and King James VII in Scotland. He was also Duke of Normandy from 31 December 1660. He lost his kingdoms in the Glorious Revolution of 1688. He did not succeed in taking them back in a war, and he spent the rest of his life in France.

He was the last Roman Catholic king in the British Isles. Some of his people did not like his religious ideas, leading a group of them to disobey and fight against him. This was called the Glorious Revolution in England and Scotland. King James and his son, James Francis Edward went into exile. The king was replaced by his Protestant daughter, Queen Mary II, and her husband King William III and II. They became rulers in 1689. 

The belief that James, not William III or Mary II, was the one true ruler became known as Jacobitism (from Jacobus or Iacobus, Latin for James). James made one serious attempt to recover his throne when he landed in Ireland in 1689. After his defeat at the Battle of the Boyne in the summer of 1690, he returned to France, living the rest of his life under the protection of King Louis XIV. His son James Francis Edward Stuart (The Old Pretender) and his grandson Charles Edward Stuart (The Young Pretender and Bonnie Prince Charlie) attempted to restore the Jacobite line after James's death, but failed.

[[Fichtelgebirge]]

CATEGORIES: Geography of Bavaria, Mountain ranges of Germany

The Fichtelgebirge is a mountain range in northeastern Bavaria, Germany. It extends from the valley of the Red Main River to the Czech border, where it is continued by the much higher Ore Mountains.

The highest mountain is the Schneeberg (1051 m). Rivers rising from the Fichtelgebirge are the White Main (German: Weißer Main), the Saxon Saale, the Ohře (German: Eger) and the Fichtelnaab which later joins the Waldnaab. Cities on the edge of the mountains include Bayreuth and Hof.

The mountains slope gradually away to the north and the south, but there is a steep slope to the west, where the Red Main forms the boundary of the mountains.

The Fichtelgebirge attracts many tourists both during summer and winter, mainly for hiking and skiing, but also to see the large rock formations.

[[Ore Mountains]]

The Ore Mountains (German Erzgebirge, Czech Krušné hory) are a mountain range in Germany and the Czech Republic. They form the border between both countries for 150 km, extending from the western border of Saxony to the Elbe river. They are named for their plentiful metal ores.

The Ore Mountains are famous for many Christmas traditions. As the ores silver and tin were not found any more in the mines, former miners had to look for new ways to feed their families. In addition to lace making and weaving, the inhabitants went into wood carving. Nutcrackers, "smoking men", "pyramids" (carousels with figures of the Christmas story or from mining) and Schwibbogen (wooden arcs with candles in the windows, symbolising the opening of a mine) are some of many Christmas goods made in the Ore Mountains. Seiffen in the East Ore Mountains was a centre of the wooden toy industry.

[[Oratorio]]

CATEGORIES: Oratorios

An oratorio is a piece of music for orchestra, choir and solo singers.  It usually tells a story from the Old Testament.  An oratorio may be about two hours long: a whole concert.  It is rather like an opera, but whereas an opera is acted out in costume on a stage, an oratorio is sung and played in a concert hall or church.  The oratorio as we know it was created in the 18th century.  The words were normally in the composer’s own language, not in Italian like most operas were at that time.

The word "oratorio" had been used many centuries ago for music-dramas performed in churches in western Europe.  In Italy oratorios and operas were both being composed in the 17th century.  In Germany composers like Heinrich Schutz and, later, Johann Sebastian Bach were writing Passions which tell the story of the crucifixion.  These are not usually called “oratorios” but they are similar.

The first important composer of oratorios was George Frideric Handel.  Handel, who was born in Germany, had become English.  Handel had written a lot of operas, but in 1732 he started to write oratorios instead and quite suddenly people became very interested in oratorios.  He used the same sort of music as in his operas: the work would start with an overture (an introduction on the orchestra) and then there would be recitative (the bits that told the story), arias (songs for the solo singers) and choruses for the choir.  The chorus was very important in oratorios: they got more to sing than in most operas.  This meant that choral societies became very popular, and this tradition spread from England (where Handel lived) to other countries in Europe.  Handel’s most famous oratorio is Messiah. Unlike most of his other oratorios, the story is not from the Old Testament.   It tells the story of the birth, life and death of Jesus.  In Britain Handel’s Messiah is traditionally performed around Christmas.  Other oratorios by Handel include: Deborah, Saul, Samson, Judas Maccabaeus and Solomon.  Handel composed all these oratorios to English texts.

In the 19th century the oratorio was very popular. At the turn of the century Joseph Haydn wrote some of his best music in his two oratorios:  Die Schöpfung (The Creation) (1798) and Die Jahreszeiten  (The Seasons) (1801). Mendelssohn wrote St Paul, Elijah and the Hymn of Praise.  Dvořák, Berlioz and Gounod are among the most important Romantic composers of oratorio, and in the 20th century famous oratorios include Elgar’s Dream of Gerontius (1900), Walton’s Belshazzar’s Feast (1931) and Tippett’s Child of our Time (1941).

[[Pterodactylus]]

CATEGORIES: Pterosaurs

Pterodactylus was a small pterosaur or flying reptile. It lived in the later Jurassic period, at the same time as many dinosaurs. Pterodactylus is typical of the short-tailed pterosaurs, a sub-order which continued to the end of the Cretaceous.  

The first specimens were found at Solnhofen in Bavaria, Germany. Also found in these strata was the famous Archaeopteryx. 

These carbonate strata formed in warm lagoons. Pterodactylus may have lived on small islands in the lagoon, or on the coast. More likely, it lived further inland and was blown here in a storm. The high salinity would support little life, so the pterosaurs would have fed in some other area.

[[Rutiodon]]

CATEGORIES: Reptiles

Rutiodon was a type of phytosaur. Phytosaurs were crocodile-like animals that lived during the time of dinosaurs. Its nostrils were far back on the head, close to the eyes.

[[Cigar]]

CATEGORIES: Smoking

A cigar is a form in which tobacco is smoked.  It is usually larger than a cigarette.  Cigars are made of different types of tobacco which are cured in many different way to produce unique flavors and fragrances.  Most quality cigars are rolled using a tobacco leaf, though more and more cigars have been rolled using different types of paper to replace the tobacco leaf.  This results in a cleaner looking cigar.  Commercially produced cigars are rolled and packed using machinery, and quality control and smokeability cannot be truly verified.  Hand rolled cigars prove to still be the best option, but are more costly.  

Cuba is known worldwide for their cigars.  Many other countries also produce cigars, most notably in the Central America and Caribbean island areas.

`Abdu'l-Bahá spent most of his adult life in prison or under arrest, because of his father's new religion.  Bahá'u'lláh called him the "Expounder" of his word, meaning that only `Abdu'l-Bahá had the right to say what Bahá'u'lláh's writings mean.  This was to prevent different people from splitting the religion up because they thought Bahá'u'lláh meant different things, the way many other religions have split up.

After Bahá'u'lláh died, Shoghi Effendi's grandfather, `Abdu'l-Bahá lead the Bahá'ís.  `Abdu'l-Bahá died, he left a "will and testament" that said that Shoghi Effendi was the "Guardian", and that his job was to guard and lead the Bahá'í Faith.  `Abdu'l-Bahá's will said that only Shoghi Effendi could interpret `Abdu'l-Bahá's or Bahá'u'lláh's books and letters.  This was to prevent different people from splitting the religion up because they thought Bahá'u'lláh or `Abdu'l-Bahá meant different things, the way many other religions have split up.

[[Will (law)]]

CATEGORIES: Death customs, Documents, Property

A will or testament is a legal document that explains the last wishes of someone after they die. It is sometimes called a "last will and testament".

A person writes a will and testament before they die, and usually writes what they want to happen to their estate (money and their things) after they die. A will may also provide for other issues including,

When a person passes away, the person's will may be probated, meaning that a probate court will authorize a representative to carry out the deceased person's wishes. Depending upon where probate occurs, the representative may be called a personal representative, executor or administrator.

[[Uhlan]]

CATEGORIES: Poland, Army

Uhlan is the name for a type of Polish soldier of light cavalry, armed with lance (a kind of spear). The respect for such Polish troops caused that in the beginning of the 19th century great part of European armies created similar military units. In most European armies, the units of that kind took the name of lancers. In the Russian, Austrian, and German armies, the units of Polish lancers had kept the original name of Uhlans.

[[Chin]]

CATEGORIES: Basic English 850 words, Face

The chin is the bottom part of the face. It is under the mouth and is the forward part of the jaw.

The chin is unique to present-day humans, our species. It is not present in the anthropoid apes, nor in any other hominin. Neanderthals did not have a human-type chin. In medical anatomy, the chin is called the "mental eminence".

Its absence in Homo floresiensis is grounds for thinking that small hominin was not of our species.

It is thought that our chin may have become shaped like this to improve the muscle attachments of the lips and tongue. Chins can be larger or smaller, depending on the person. Even though chin sizes vary a lot, it is usually further forward than the rest of the face in normal humans.

[[Knot]]

CATEGORIES: Basic English 850 words, Knots

A knot is a fixed looping of a piece of string or rope. Knots are often used for binding things together. While a knot is often made from rope, it can also be made from many other things. In fact, a knot is actually the condition a long flexible object is in. For example, hair can be tied in a knot. The ends of balloons are tied in a knot to prevent the air from escaping. The average person over 5 or so years of age is likely capable of tying a knot; most of these knots people tie are probably with their shoelaces. Ribbons are also tied in a knot so as to appear pretty, as when wrapped around a gift. In addition, knots are also made by sailors in many different forms and for many different purposes. There are even people who have adopted knot-making as a hobby.

Anonymous is a group of anonymous online activists. They are associated with many online and offline protests. These protests commonly relate to freedom of speech. They often protest against political corruption and censorship. Anonymous also makes DDoS attacks (where an attacker disconnects his or her target from the internet, sometimes forever) on popular websites such as PayPal and the United States' Department of Justice homepage. Other common targets include organizations who seem to limit people's freedom of speech.

Anonymous is also often associated with image boards such as 4chan and protests such as the Occupy Movement.

Some people have been arrested for involvement in Anonymous cyberattacks in countries including the U.S., UK, Australia, the Netherlands, Spain, and Turkey. Views of the group's actions and usefulness vary widely. Supporters have called the group "freedom fighters" and digital Robin Hoods while some have judged them as "a cyber lynch-mob" or "cyber terrorists". In 2012, Time called Anonymous one of the "100 most influential people" of 2012 in the world.

Members of anonymous are called Anons. When anons appear in public, they often wear Guy Fawkes masks. Guy Fawkes masks come from a graphic novel and film called V for Vendetta. Some Anons also disguise their voice with voice changers (products that distort a user's voice) or text-to-speech programs.

[[Beowulf (hero)]]

CATEGORIES: Germanic mythology

Beowulf is the hero of the Anglo-Saxon poem Beowulf. He was the son of Ecgþeow, a banished warrior of the Wægmundings. Ecgþeow had killed a man from another clan and had to flee to the Danes. The Danish king Hroðgar accepted him as one of his warriors. The king also paid to repay the blood feud that was threatening Ecgþeow.

When King Hroðgar came upon difficulties because his land was raided by the giant Grendel- a descendant of Cain, and cursed-, Ecgþeow's son Beowulf came to help him with twelve warriors. During the night, Grendel arrived to attack the sleeping men. Grendel gruesomely slaughtered one man before anyone awoke, but Beowulf attacked him. Beowulf had earlier decided to fight without his sword because he thought it would be shameful to fight with unequal weaponry. He, however, outmatched Grendel in strength and tore off his arm. Grendel fled back to his cave, where he died and his arm was fixed to the wall like a trophy. During the following night, Grendel's Mother arrived and Beowulf had an even harder fight against her, as she stole back her son's arm and retreated to her underwater cave. Beowulf followed her and spent a day sinking to the bottom of the lake, and they fought it out a while before Beowulf saw a sword, which conveniently was the only sword that could possibly kill Grendel's mother. He stabbed her with it, and she died. The sword dissolved and he found and beheaded Grendel's body. He brought back the head as a trophy. Beowulf was greatly rewarded for both of these feats, and he and his men were showered in glory and riches. All the gold was presented to their king, and Beowulf was rewarded with a great sword, land, a hall, and the throne of the Geats when the current king dies.

Later on in life, Beowulf ruled over his native Geatland for 50 years until a dragon attacked after a golden goblet was stolen from its cave by a slave. He travels to its cave and successfully slays it, but is severely injured in the melee. He was bitten in the neck, and the venom will kill him. The dying Beowulf then crowns a young warrior called Wiglaf as his successor (as he himself does not have children and all his predecessors have died). Wiglaf is one of the 12 soldiers he took with him to fight the dragon, but the only one who stayed when they saw he was losing. He is then burned on a pyre with all of his gold he won by slaying the dragon. 

[[Clan]]

[[Muon-catalyzed fusion]]

CATEGORIES: Nuclear physics

Muon-catalyzed fusion (μCF) is a type of cold nuclear fusion, which means that nuclear fusion can happen at low temperatures and under normal pressure. There need to be 3 particles: a muon, a positively charged triton and a positively charged deuteron. The muon, which has a greater mass (when its not moving) than an electron, drags the heavier triton and the deuteron to it, creating something called a muonic heavy hydrogen ion. This means that the particle is a hydrogen atom with more protons then electrons, that contains a muon, and that contains extra neutrons which make it heavier. This reaction can be done at room temperature or below, such as -270 degrees Celsius.

To create these, a stream of negative muons is sent onto blocks of protium, deuterium and tritium (3 first isotopes of hydrogen). The muon bumps out the electron in the hydrogen atom. Because the electron is replaced, any 2 atoms are bound together. This makes a molecular ion, also called a special muonic molecule. A muon is 207 times more massive then an electron. Because of the difference in mass, the atom changes. Because it is heavier, the atoms in the molecular ion are pressed very tightly together, and then the nuclei, the centers of the atoms, join together. The following process is called nuclear fusion. The 2 nuclei join together and "glue" together. But, their weights do not just add up, a part of their mass is released as energy. This is the energy used. 

Now, the process continues because the muon is thrown out of the nuclei when they fuse, so it can join other nuclei, which continues the reaction. Sometimes the muon is attached to something else thrown out from the nucleus, and the muon is lost. This stops the reaction. 

The good thing about this is that muon-catalyzed fusion uses little energy, and produces much energy. The only problem is that the reaction is not stable, so it does not last a long time, because the muons are lost. This process is still a long way from being used for business.

[[Nomadic people]]

CATEGORIES: Nomadic people

Nomadic people (or nomads) are people who move from one place to another, instead of living in one place. The best known examples in Europe are gypsies, Roma, Sinti, and Irish travelers. Many other ethnic groups and communities are traditionally nomadic; such as Berbers, Kazakhs, and Bedouin.

People are nomads for many reasons. Most nomads are family men herding their livestock, such as cattle, or horses from pasture to pasture. These people have to change places because of the weather. Other nomads are traders and craftsmen (people who make things), traveling to exchange goods or to practice their craft where it is needed.

Nomads who follow their herds usually live in tents with few things inside, like the Mongols. Nomads who trade or practice crafts usually have wagons in which they travel, because wagons are better for carrying goods.

The Sami of Lapland are semi-nomadic tribe following a herd of reindeer. They are a migratory people who lead their own herd of reindeer to winter feeding grounds and then return them in the spring to their feeding ground close to a permanent home base, where their family lives. This cycle happens every year.  

The skills of nomadic life can also be useful in mobile warfare, and have been used in attacking sedentary agricultural and urban people. Genghis Khan and the Mongol hordes, for example conquered vast areas in Asia by organizing themselves as cavalry.

[[Refraction]]

CATEGORIES: Wave physics

Refraction is the change in direction of a wave, caused by the change in the wave's  speed. Examples of waves include sound waves and light waves. Refraction is seen most often when a wave passes from one transparent medium to another transparent medium. Different types of medium include air and water. 

When a wave passes from one transparent medium to another transparent medium, the wave will change its speed and its direction. For example, when a light wave travels through air and then passes into water, the wave will slow and change direction.

As light goes into a medium which is denser, the light ray will 'bend' toward the normal. When it goes back into the less dense medium (with a lower refractive index), it will bend back through the same angle as when it came in (if the surface at exit is parallel to the surface at entry).

An example of how refraction works is placing a straw in a cup of water, with part of the straw in the water. When looking at a certain angle, the straw appears to bend at the water's surface. This is because of the change in density of the medium and thus, bending of light rays as they move from the air to water.

A good and simple way to understand how light works is to think of it like a car. When the car hits the gravel surface (this is the medium) on an angle, the tire that hits it first will slow, causing it to turn in that direction. Therefore, if light hits a medium on the right having a greater refractive index, it will bend right. The amount of bending is given by Snell's law. Lenses work by refraction.

When light refracts in a prism, it splits into colours of the rainbow because some wavelengths bend more than others. 

In optics the refractive index or index of refraction n of a substance is a dimensionless number that describes how light, or other radiation, goes through that medium. It is defined as 

where c is the speed of light in a vacuum and v is the phase velocity of light in the medium. Snell's law uses refractive indexes to calculate the amount of refraction.

[[Psychedelic mushroom]]

CATEGORIES: Fungi, Drugs, Consciousness

Magic mushrooms or psychedelic mushrooms or Psilocybin mushrooms contain the alkaloid psilocybin, or similar  substances. 

Psilocybin is a mind-altering chemical. It changes the brain to an altered state of mind, or a different state of consciousness. This can lead to effects like hallucinations or visions. They may be used for medical purposes to treat cluster headaches, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and certain kinds of depression.

Psilocybe semilanceata is the classic example of a magic mushroom, but there are quite a few others. These fungi also have some species with psilocybin: Copelandia, Gymnopilus, Inocybe, Mycena, Panaeolus, Pholiotina, Pluteus.

Psilocybin can kill in extremely high doses. The LD50 of psilocybin is 280 mg/kg for rats, this is about 1.5 times that of caffeine. In normal psychedelic mushrooms, psilocybin makes up about 1% of their weight. Therefore, nearly 1.7 kilograms of dried mushrooms, or 17 kilograms of fresh mushrooms, would be required for a 60 kg person to reach the 280 mg/kg LD50 rate of rats.

Psilocybin mushrooms have probably been used since prehistoric times. They may be seen in rock art. Many cultures have used these mushrooms in religious rites. Psychedelic mushrooms have been used by native peoples of Mesoamerica for religious communion and healing. Catholic missionaries were against the use of magic mushrooms. In Modern society, they are sometimes used recreationally. Their medical use in psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy is studied, for example, in the treatment for anxiety and depression in patients with life-threatening cancer, the treatment of depression and to help quit smoking.

The function of compounds like this in nature is they reduce the likelihood of the mushroom being eaten before its spores have been scattered. It is a defence against herbivory.

The Spanish Armada was a spanish naval fleet (army of ships) most famous for being used by Spain's King Philip II against Britain in 1588. The ships were on their way to Flanders (across the English channel from England) to fetch an army to invade England. The Royal Navy of England during queen Elizabeth I's reign caught up with them on the way. The English defeated the Armada by using the wind to blow ships that were lit on fire into the anchored fleet. This started on 12 July 1588 and ended during August 1588.

The Second in Command of the Royal Navy was Sir Francis Drake. Drake was playing a game of bowling with his friends when he heard of the attack. He boldly insisted that he had time to finish the game and defeat the Spanish Armada afterwards.

The Spanish Armada was led by the Spanish Duke of Medina Sidonia, who had no naval experience. He replaced the original commander, who died in February.

[[Sun]]

CATEGORIES: Basic English 850 words, Stars, Solar System

The Sun is a star which is located at the center of our solar system. It is a yellow dwarf star that gives off different types of energy such as infra-red energy (heat), ultraviolet light, radio waves and light. It also gives off a stream of particles, which reaches Earth as "solar wind". The source of all this energy is nuclear fusion. Nuclear fusion is the reaction in the star which turns hydrogen into helium and makes huge amounts of energy.

The Sun is a star like many others in our Milky Way galaxy. The Sun is a type of star called a G-type main-sequence star based on its spectral class. It has existed for a little over 4.5 billion years. It is going to continue for at least as long. The Sun is about a hundred times as wide as the Earth. It has a mass of 1.9891. This is 333,000 times the mass of the Earth. 1.3 million Earths can fit inside the Sun.

The Sun fuses about 600 million tons of hydrogen into helium every second. It can take between 10,000 and 170,000 years for the energy in the core of the Sun to escape.

[[Civil rights]]

CATEGORIES: Civil rights

Civil rights are rights that all people in a country have. The civil rights of a country apply to all the citizens within its borders. These rights are given by the laws of the country. Civil rights are sometimes thought to be the same as natural rights.

In many countries civil rights include freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of religion, and freedom of assembly. Civil rights also include the right to own property and the right to get fair and equal treatment from the government, from other citizens, and from private groups. They may prevent against discrimination based on race, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity and disability.

Civil rights are protected by law and custom.  The constitutions of many democracies have a "Bill of Rights" that describes the people's liberties and rights. A well-known example is the United States Bill of Rights.  

A court of law decides if a person's civil rights have been violated.  The courts also decide the limits of civil rights, so that people do not use their freedoms to take away the rights of other people.

[[Greenwich Mean Time]]

CATEGORIES: Time zones

Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) is an internationally standardized time format. It is the main time zone in several countries, including the United Kingdom and Portugal. GMT has the same time as UTC, but there are differences between the two. Technically, GMT is a time zone, while UTC is a time standard.

GMT was established in 1884 at the International Meridian Conference, which met to establish a standardized system for measuring world longitude. They decided that the meridian passing through the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, England would be 0° longitude.This conference also decided that the time zone around the meridian, GMT, would be the time zone used for reference around the world. Other countries would define their time based on GMT.

UTC was defined in 1963 as the new world reference for time. The major advantage of the new standard was that its time was determined by highly accurate atomic clocks, not the sun at Greenwich. Other advantages of UTC are that calling the new standard Coordinated Universal Time avoids giving more importance to any one country, and that UTC does not adjust for Daylight Saving Time, which means the world always has a standard time.

[[Python (programming language)]]

CATEGORIES: Programming languages, Computer science, Computing

the programming language

Python is an interpreted language. Interpreted languages do not need to be compiled to run. A program called an interpreter runs Python code on almost any kind of computer. This means that a programmer can change the code and quickly see the results. This also means Python is slower than a compiled language like C, because it is not running machine code directly.

Python is a good programming language for beginners. It is a high-level language, which means a programmer can focus on what to do instead of how to do it. Writing programs in Python takes less time than in some other languages.

Python drew inspiration from other programming languages like C, C++, Java, Perl, and Lisp.

Python's developers try to avoid changing the language to make it better until they have a lot of things to change. Also, they try not to make small repairs, called patches, to unimportant parts of the CPython reference implementation that would make it faster. When speed is important, a Python programmer can move some of the work of the program to other parts written in programming languages like C or PyPy, a just-in-time compiler. It translates a Python script into C and makes direct C-level API calls into the Python interpreter.

Keeping Python fun to use is an important goal of Python’s developers. It reflects in the language's name, a tribute to the British comedy group Monty Python. On occasions, they are playful approaches to tutorials and reference materials, such as referring to spam and eggs instead of the standard foo and bar.

[[Arthur Schopenhauer]]

CATEGORIES: 1788 births, 1860 deaths, 19th century philosophers, Continental philosophers, German atheists, German philosophers, People from former German territories, People from Gdańsk

Arthur Schopenhauer (February 22, 1788 in Danzig – September 21, 1860 in Frankfurt am Main) was a German philosopher.

He was influenced by Kant, Plato and eastern teachings, especially Buddhism and the Upanishads.

Schopenhauer believed that the primary characteristic, or essence of all things - including human beings - is not intelligence, rationality or spirit, but will. By "will" he means a wanting and craving like that which we know in ourselves as our "will." It is the source of immense amounts of suffering in the world. He also believed that a "better consciousness" could be attained by denying the fulfilment of our desires, taking time to think about who we really are and what we should do to avoid suffering - but also, in doing something few philosophers of his day spoke of: in making and looking at works of art, especially music, which he considered a way to escape from the world's pain and suffering.

Schopenhauer was a huge influence on Richard Wagner, Friedrich Nietzsche, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Thomas Mann, Sigmund Freud, Leo Tolstoy, Carl Jung, Emil Cioran and many other important artists and thinkers of the 20th Century.

[[Hypotenuse]]

CATEGORIES: Geometry

The hypotenuse is the side opposite the 90 degrees angle in a right triangle. It is always the longest side.

For example:

In this triangle, if angle C is 90 degrees, then the opposite side, "c", is the hypotenuse. The hypotenuse is important in trigonometry, where it is used to calculate many functions.

The length of the hypotenuse can be calculated if the other two sides are known, using Pythagoras' Theorem.  In fact, the length of any side of a right triangle can be calculated if the other two sides are known, using this theorem.

[[Python]]

CATEGORIES: Pythons

Python is the name given to a genus of constricting snakes. Such snakes are not venomous. its family is the Pythonidae. Pythons are more closely related to boas than to any other snake family. 

Boulenger (1890) thought this group was a subfamily (Pythoninae) of the family Boidae (boas). However, boas produce live young, while pythons are oviparous: they lay eggs.

Python can be found in Southeast Asia and Africa, and other members of the family are found in New Guinea and Australia. Pythons can range from 3 feet long in species like ball pythons to 29 feet in species like reticulated pythons. Python is one of eight genera in the family. They all have a rather similar life style.

Most members of the family are ambush predators: they stay motionless in a camouflaged position, and then strike suddenly at passing prey. They wrap their body round the prey and squeeze. To kill its prey, the python squeezes it to death, then swallows it whole. Larger pythons can prey on animals as large as a full-grown deer. In Africa, there are pythons that eat gazelles. Most of their prey is much smaller than that. Pythons may take several days or even weeks to fully digest prey.

Despite their size, pythons are rarely dangerous to humans.

Python can be up to 900 cm long and weigh up to 90 kg, but males are much smaller and lighter than females. The python can live up to 30 years. The breeding time is between 60 or 70 days.

Research indicates that all snakes, including pythonids, are descended from a venomous ancestor.

[[Artificial neural network]]

CATEGORIES: Artificial intelligence

A neural network (also called an ANN or an artificial neural network) is a sort of computer software, inspired by biological neurons. Biological brains are capable of solving difficult problems, but each neuron is only responsible for solving a very small part of the problem. Similarly, a neural network is made up of cells that work together to produce a desired result, although each individual cell is only responsible for solving a small part of the problem. This is one method for creating artificially intelligent programs.

Neural networks are an example of machine learning, where a program can change as it learns to solve a problem. A neural network can be trained and improved with each example, but the larger the neural network, the more examples it needs to perform well—often needing millions or billions of examples in the case of deep learning.

CATEGORIES: People in Greek mythology

Icarus was the son of Daedalus. Daedalus was imprisoned in his own invention, the labyrinth. He helped the hero Theseus kill King Minos’s beast, the Minotaur, and run away with King Minos’s daughter, Ariadne. 

Daedelus came up with a plan. He knew that Minos controlled all escape routes by land or sea, so he decided to go by air. He built wings for himself and Icarus. They found their way out of the labyrinth and flew out of the highest tower. 

Icarus foolishly ignored his father’s advice to fly on the same route as him so that the sun would not melt the wings and the sea would not dampen them. Icarus flew up higher and higher toward the sun, and the wax in the wings melted and he fell into the sea and drowned. Daedalus looked down towards the sea and saw the feathers floating on the water and figured out what happened. Eventually Daedalus found the body and buried it on the island of Icaria, and the sea which Icarus fell into is now called the Icarian Sea.

[[Sales quote]]

CATEGORIES: Commerce

A sales quote is an estimated amount that a person selling something gives to a customer. It is given to show them how much it would cost to have the work done. Many services do not have fixed prices for work. The cost can change depending on the tools, materials and how much work is needed to be done for each customer. The person calculates an estimated amount, and gives this to the customer, so that they can have an idea how much it will cost. A sales quote is simply a formal statement. However, it cannot be considered a legally binding contract. It is a mutual understanding in the form of document between the seller and the buyer. However, once the quote has been accepted, the customer is committed to making a purchase at the stated price. A quotation is a business document that is similar to an invoice and contains all the same elements. However, the purpose for both are different, to provide the customer with a detailed list of the product or service being offered, before the order is confirmed.

Sales quote is for example a quote given to the customer by auto insurance broker based on details like income, work position, criminal record and others.

The sales quote is figured from the information given by the potential customer, about the work they would like to have done.

[[Fingering]]

CATEGORIES: Musical performance techniques

Fingering means: choosing which finger to use for each note when playing a piece on a musical instrument.  When learning to play a piece it is important to try to find a good fingering.

Sometimes printed music has some fingering printed above the notes.  This can be helpful to the player, but it is not always necessary to use the printed fingering.  People’s hands are different and a fingering that is good for one player may not be good for another.

[[Icon]]

CATEGORIES: Art, Christian art, Painting

An icon (from the Greek language: εἰκών, eikon, "image") is an image, picture, or representation which has a religious meaning. It is a sign or a likeness that stands for a real object or person. Although the word icon can be used for images of other religions, it is most often used to describe a painting on a wooden panel that has been done in the Orthodox Christian tradition, and may also be used for carved ivory panels and panels of silver or gold. These icons show a holy being such as Jesus, Mary, a saint or an angel. They also show scenes from the Bible such as the Crucifixion and scenes from lives of the saints. In Orthodox Christianity an icon is thought of as a window through which a person can get a view of God's truth. 

==How a Christian Orthodox icon is painted== 

The traditional way of making an icon was used in Egypt in Early Christian times to make portraits of dead people to use for their funerals. Like icons, these funeral portraits were done on a wooden panel and the paint was mixed with yolk of egg. From the time that Christianity was made legal by Constantine the Great in the early 300s, artists began to use the same method for painting holy pictures. 

It was always hoped that a painting would last for a long time, so everything had to be very carefully prepared. A board had to be chosen that would not crack or warp (bend), and which did not have any knotty bits that might fall out. The board was sanded smooth and then coated with a gluey paint called "size" which would hold the coloured paint well, but stop the expensive colours from being soaked up by the wood. The artist would prepare the paints very carefully. Some of the colours were made from gound-up semi-precious stones. Others were made from chemicals. 

Before the artist could start on the panel, he had to prepare the design. It was not important for the artist to think of something new and different. It was much more important that he could copy another icon very accurately. The same designs were used over and over. 

Although all icons were thought of as a window to Heaven, some icons were believed to have special properties. It was believed that praying and lighting candles before some icons would bring healing, or the help of the saint who was shown in the picture. These icons became very famous and were often copied. 

After the artist had drawn the design onto the surface of the size in thin green or brown paint, he would put the paint on in  layers, building up the colours bit by bit. Most of the colours were quite transparent and this made the painting look glowing. When the figures were finished the artist would set the work in a wooden frame and "gild" it by covering the background with a little pieces of gold leaf that had been beaten into very thin sheets. When a candle was lit near the icon, it shone on the gold surface and made the figures stand out.

==Icons in other religions== 

Throughout history, some religions such as Christianity and Hinduism, have often used images such as paintings and statues, while others, such as Judaism and Islam, do not often use images of people.  

In Hinduism there is much use of sacred objects because there is a belief in murti, the idea that the Spirit of God can be present in an icon (or holy object).

At age fourteen, he took lessons in drawing and clay modeling. After two years, he started to study at the National Academy of Design with Leon Kroll, Ivan Olinsky, and Hermon McNeil. In 1912, he entered the Beaux-Arts Institute. It was there that Jo Davidson and Elie Nadelman helped him out. He was a great artist at everything. In 1935, he started doing mostly just sculpture. Maldarelli is best known for sculptures of female forms that have great detail. Some of them took as long as 13 years. In 1941, Maldarelli won the Logan Prize ($500) for a detailed sculpture of a limestone head. He was a teacher at Columbia University for many years, teaching the art of sculpting.

[[Brights]]

[[Western civilization]]

CATEGORIES: Society, Culture

Western civilization,  western culture or the West is made up of European culturally derived societies (most notably in the Classical Roman heritage,Western Christianity (Catholicism and Protestantism), Democracy and Liberalism). This at least includes Western and Central Europe, English speaking North America, Australia and New Zealand. The identities of places such as Latin America, South Africa, Israel, the Philippines and Singapore are disputed due to those countries being a blend of both western and non western cultures.    

Until the process of secularization in the west began with the Age of Enlightenment in the 17th century, Western civilization was also called Christendom meaning the area where the Christian religion is in the majority (a view held by historian Arnold Toynbee).  By this definition, most parts of Africa would now also be part of Western civilization since many Africans have been converted to Christianity since the 1950s.

Westernization is the transformation of a non western culture to Western standards, with historical examples being the Romanization of "barbarian" europe in the classical period, the Hispanization of South America, Central America and the Philippines in the 1500s, the Anglicization of North America and Australia in the 1700s, the Francization of North and West Africa in the 1800s and the current Americanization of many first world nations such as Singapore and Israel through Hollywood/ American popular culture.  

Though there are many supporters of westernization, there are also many people who oppose it it expanding at the expense of local cultures. 

[[E (mathematical constant)]]

CATEGORIES: Number theory, Irrational numbers, Transcendental numbers

e is a number. It is the base of natural logarithm and is about 2.71828. It is an important mathematical constant. The number e is occasionally called Euler's number after the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler, or Napier's constant in honor of the Scottish mathematician John Napier who introduced logarithms. It is equally important in mathematics as π and i. e is an irrational number, and Euler himself gave the first 23 digits of e.

The number e has great importance in mathematics, as do 0, 1, pi, and i. All five of these numbers are important and occur again and again in mathematics. The five constants appear in one formulation of Euler's identity. Like the constant pi, e is also irrational (it cannot be represented as a ratio of integers) and transcendental (it is not a root of any non-zero polynomial with rational coefficients).

The number e is very important for exponential functions. For example, the exponential function applied to the number one, has a value of e.

e was discovered in 1683 by the Swiss mathematician Jacob Bernoulli, while he was studying compound interest. The numerical value of e truncated to 20 decimal places is:

[[Platelet]]

CATEGORIES: Blood

A platelet is a cell fragment that circulates in the blood. Platelets are involved in hemostasis through the making of blood clots. A low platelet count (number of platelets in the blood) can cause a person to bleed without their blood clotting (making scabs). A high platelet count can increase the risk of thrombosis (blood clots inside blood vessels), which stops blood from flowing properly.

[[Eastern Europe]]

CATEGORIES: Eastern Europe

Eastern Europe is the eastern region of Europe. Originally, it referred to the countries that were under the influence of the Eastern Orthodox Church in Constantinople during the middle ages, which was in contrast to the West which referred to the countries under the influence of the Roman Catholic and later Protestant Churches. Later during the Cold War it meant the European countries that belonged to the Soviet Union, a definition that still persists today in these post-soviet states. Others describe Eastern Europe as a region of predominantly Slavic cultures, though other ethnic groups live there as well. Eastern Europe has a large Roma gypsy population.

According to the widest contemporary definitions - including those used by the UN Statistics Division, several other UN organizations and EuroVoc (the multilingual thesaurus of the EU) - the following states are in Eastern Europe:

[[Eastern Bloc]]

CATEGORIES: 20th century in Europe, Communism

The term Eastern Bloc referred to the former Communist states of Eastern and Central Europe, including the countries of the Warsaw Pact, along with Yugoslavia and Albania, which were not aligned with the Soviet Union after 1948 and 1960 respectively. The Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (COMECON) arranged economic cooperation among the members.

Communist governments were initially installed, mostly in places that had been controlled by the Axis countries and occupied due to the victories of the Soviet Union on the Eastern Front (World War II). The process included extensive political and media controls, along with a Soviet approach to restricting emigration. Events such as the split of Josip Broz Tito and Berlin Blockade prompted stricter control. While certain oppositional factions in the Bloc had revolts, such as the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 and the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, Mikhail Gorbachev's perestroika experienced inefficiencies and stagnation throughout much of the Bloc preceding the Bloc's dissolution. Counterrevolutions in 1989 dissolved the Soviet Bloc.

A 2009 Pew Research Center poll showed that 72% of Hungarians and 62% of both Ukrainians and Bulgarians felt that their lives were worse off after 1989, when free markets were made dominant. A follow-up poll by Pew Research Center in 2011 showed that 45% of Lithuanians, 42% of Russians, and 34% of Ukrainians approved of the change to a market economy.

[[Truthiness]]

Truthiness is a word used by Stephen Colbert. It was first used on October 17, 2005 in the first episode of the television show The Colbert Report. The word is used to describe something that feels truthful. Facts and logic have nothing to do with truthiness. The truthiness of something is only measured by it instinctively feeling correct.

The word was picked as the word of the year for 2005 by the American Dialect Society on January 6, 2006. It was also selected by the Merriam-Webster dictionary on December 10, 2006 as its 2006 Word of the Year. It beat the term google to get Word of the Year.

[[Multi-core processor]]

CATEGORIES: Computer hardware

A multi-core CPU is a computer processor which has two or more sections. Each section of the chip executes instructions as if it was a separate computer. The actual processors are still on one chip. On this chip every core looks mostly like the other. They are several mostly independent cores which work together in parallel. A dual-core processor is a multi-core processor with two independent microprocessors. A quad-core processor is a multi-core processor with four independent microprocessors. As you might be able to tell from the prefix, the name of the processor is based on the number of the microprocessors on the chip.

[[Western Bloc]]

CATEGORIES: Politics

The Western Bloc during the Cold War means the powers allied with the United States and NATO against the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact. 

Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact were called the Eastern Bloc. This term was rather common, while the governments and press of the Western Bloc used to speak of themselves as the Free world. 

[[Free world]]

CATEGORIES: Politics, Democracy

The Free World is a term that was used during the era of the Cold War. It was often used by non-communist nations to describe themselves. It was used to describe the greater personal freedom that the people of non-communist countries (such as the United States and European democratic countries) had compared to the communist Soviet Union and its Communist Bloc allies. 

On the other hand, many of the non-communist countries that were allied with the "Free World" during the Cold War repressed people and sometimes had dictators as their leaders. This included countries in South America, Asia and Africa.

The President of the United States was often called  the "leader of the Free World". This was very common especially in the United States itself. The President of the U.S. is sometimes still called this.

The Warsaw Pact, officially the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance, was an organization of Central and Eastern European Communist states. The states were all allies and would fight together if one of them was attacked. While in theory all the countries in the organisation were equals, the smaller countries were controlled by the Soviet Union. 

It was established in 1955 in Warsaw, Poland in response to West Germany joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization(NATO). The treaty was signed in Warsaw, on 14 May 1955 and official copies were made in the languages of Russian, Polish, Czech and German. The Pact lasted until the end of the Cold War when some members quit in 1991, following the collapse of the Eastern bloc and political changes in the Soviet Union.

[[Four-wheel drive]]

CATEGORIES: Automotive technologies

A Four-wheel drive (also called 4WD and 4x4) is a vehicle on which all four wheels get power from the engine to move forward. This is as opposed to a two-wheel drive vehicle. 4WDs are often used off road. Part-time and full-time four wheel drive vehicles uses a transfer case as part of the drivetrain to direct power to one or both axles. By having a transfer case the driver can shift the vehicle into either "two-wheel-drive" or "four-wheel-drive" mode (part-time systems). Many transfer cases also have a low power range that multiplies the engine power when in four-wheel drive (called four-wheel low gear).

[[Orange (fruit)]]

CATEGORIES: Citrus

An orange is a type of citrus fruit that people often eat. Oranges are a very good source of Vitamin C. Orange juice is an important part of many people's breakfast. The "sweet orange", which is the kind that are most often eaten today, grew first in South and East Asia but now grows in lots of parts of the world.

Oranges are round orange-coloured fruit that grow on a tree which can reach 10 metres (33 ft) high. Orange trees have dark green shiny leaves and small white flowers with five petals. The flowers smell very sweet which attracts many bees.

An orange has a tough shiny orange skin. Inside, the fruit is divided into "segments", which have thin tough skins that hold together many little sections with juice inside. There are usually ten segments in an orange, but sometimes there are more or less. Inside each segment of most types of orange there are seeds called "pips". Orange trees can be grown from pips, but some types of orange trees can only be grown from "cuttings" (a piece cut off a tree and made to grow roots). The segments and the skin are separated by white stringy fibrous material called "pith". In most types of oranges, the skin can be peeled off the pith, and the segments can be pulled apart with the fingers to be eaten. In some oranges it is hard to take the skin off. Orange skin is often called "orange peel".

Oranges are an important food source in many parts of the world for several reasons. They are a commonly available source of vitamin C. They last longer than many other fruits when they are stored. They are easy to transport because each orange comes in its own tough skin which acts as a container. They can be piled into heaps or carried in bags, lunchboxes and shipping containers without being easily damaged.

The colour orange takes its name from the fruit. The word "orange" is unusual because it is one of only a few English words that do not rhyme with anything.

The orange is particularly used in Asia for wide variety of purposes including cosmetic as well  as medicinal. Doctors prescribe oranges for people who suffer from diabetes needed.

[[Diplodocus]]

Diplodocus was a huge dinosaur from the same time as the Allosaurus. It lived during the Upper Jurassic period, about 145 to 155 million years ago. It was a vegetarian, eating mostly leaves with its peg-like teeth.

== Size == 

Diplodocus was a long-necked, whip-tailed giant and could grow up to 27 m long. It had an 8 m long neck and 14 m long tail. Its weight was approximately 22,680 kg. It had a short 6 ft long head. Its size helped protect it from other dinosaurs. It used its long neck to poke into forests because its body was too big. It is also believed to have knocked the trees down. The longest species is the hallorum, which was thought to be the longest of all dinosaurs (now Amphicoelias).

[[Bacteriophage]]

CATEGORIES: Viruses, Parasites

A bacteriophage is a virus that infects bacteria.  The term is commonly shortened to phage.

Bacteriophages are among the most common and diverse entities in the biosphere. Like viruses that infect eukaryotes (plants, animals, and fungi)  there are many different phage structures and functions.

The top of phages is made up of a dice-like shape which has 20 sides and 30 edges. Inside it contains the genetic information, which is its DNA. This dice-like shape often sits on a tail that has leg-like fibres.

Phages are typically made of an outer protein hull that has genetic material inside it.  The genetic material may be single-stranded (ssRNA or ssDNA), or double-stranded (dsRNA or dsDNA). It may be between 5,000 to 500,000 base pairs long with either circular or linear arrangement. Bacteriophages are usually between 20 and 200 nanometers in size.

Phage genomes may code for as few as four genes, and as many as hundreds of genes. Phages have a life cycle that begins when the phage attaches to the bacterium. Then they inject their genome into the bacterium. The genome uses the parts of the bacterium to replicate inside it. When there are many phages inside the bacterium, they put enzymes in the bacterium that weaken the outer cell wall so they can burst through it to infect new bacterias.

Phages are everywhere there are bacteria, such as soils or the intestines of animals. They are very common in sea water: up to 9×108 virions per milliliter have been found in microbial mats at the surface, and up to 70% of marine bacteria may be infected by phages.

They have been used for over 90 years as an alternative to antibiotics in the former Soviet Union and Central Europe, as well as in France. However, it was not until the first phage was observed under an electron microscope by Helmut Ruska in 1939 that its true nature was established. 

They are a possible therapy against antibiotic resistant strains of many bacteria.  On the other hand, some phages complicate biofilms involved in pneumonia and cystic fibrosis. They shelter the bacteria from drugs and so prolong the infection.

[[Deconstruction]]

CATEGORIES: Literature

Deconstruction is a way of understanding how something was created, usually things like art, books, poems and other writing. Deconstruction is breaking something down into smaller parts. Deconstruction looks at the smaller parts that were used to create an object. The smaller parts are usually ideas. 

Sometimes deconstruction looks at how an author can imply things he does not mean. It says that because words are not precise, we can never know what an author meant.

Sometimes deconstruction looks at the things the author did not say because he made assumptions. 

One thing it pays attention to is how opposites work. (It calls them "binary oppositions.") It says that two opposites like "good" and "bad" are not really different things. "Good" only makes sense when someone compares it to "bad," and "bad" only makes sense when someone compares it to "good." And so even when someone talks about "good," they are still talking about "bad." But this is just one thing it does.

Because of things like this, deconstruction argues that books and poems never just mean what we think they mean at first. Other meanings are always there too, and the book or poem works because all of those meanings work together. The closer we look at the writing, the more we find about how it works, and how meaning works for all things. If we deconstructed everything, we might never be able to talk or write at all. But that does not mean deconstruction is useless. If we deconstruct some things, we can learn more about them and about how talking and writing work.

[[Nihilism]]

CATEGORIES: Philosophical movements and positions, Terrorism, Anarchism

Nihilism is a way of thinking which rejects concepts, meaning, or life. It is a Philosophical movements and positions or condition. Nihility means "nothingness", and "nihil" is the Latin word for "nothing". Nihilism can mean the belief that values are meaningless ideas. It can also mean the belief that nothing has any meaning or purpose. In fact, there are many different beliefs that can be called nihilism. The German thinker Friedrich Nietzsche wrote many things about nihilism. What he wrote is often called the most important explanation of nihilism. Nietzsche wrote that nihilism comes from questioning traditional values until they fall apart. This is called "#Value destruction".

The Russian thinker Mikhail Bakunin inspired a lot of nihilists because he believed this kind of destruction was good. The word "nihilism" was then made popular by a Russian novel called Fathers and Sons by Ivan Turgenev. The hero of the story is a nihilist named Bazarov. Some other Russian thinkers such as Dmitry Pisarev also wrote good things about this kind of destruction. Russian nihilism inspired many revolutionaries, such as Sergei Nechaev and Vladimir Lenin. The Russian author Fyodor Dostoevsky was almost also a nihilist. But he became an #Anti-nihilism after ten years in exile. He wrote about nihilism in many novels such as Crime and Punishment. The people who assassinated the Russian emperor, Tsar Alexander II on 13 March 1881, are often thought of as nihilists.

Nietzsche thought value destruction could not be avoided, even though it has bad results. He also thought Christianity was a source of this value destruction, and was therefore a kind of nihilism. According to the French writer Gilles Deleuze, he thought Christianity was nihilistic because it was #Life-denying, meaning it has a negative and unhealthy attitude towards living. Religious thinkers have instead thought that nihilism comes from rejecting religion. Some parts of Buddhism have also been called a kind of nihilism, even though other parts strongly reject nihilism. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the word "nihilism" was mostly used against people who rejected religion or believed in nothing. Either way, nihilism is often seen as a word for life-denying beliefs.

[[Coronary artery disease]]

CATEGORIES: Heart disease

Coronary artery disease, also called coronary heart disease, is a heart disease. ("Coronary" means "the blood vessels of the heart".) Coronary heart disease causes plaque to build up inside the coronary arteries. This causes the coronary arteries to become narrower. An artery is a blood vessel - a tube that carries blood. After the heart supplies blood that is full of oxygen and nutrients, the arteries carry the blood to different parts of the body. The coronary arteries are very important: they supply blood to the heart muscle. So when the coronary arteries become narrower, less blood gets to the heart muscle.

Most people with coronary heart disease can feel healthy for years before they start experiencing symptoms. The most common symptom is a heart attack.  If coronary heart disease is not treated, some of the plaques in the coronary arteries can break away and block the blood flow to the heart.  Coronary heart disease is the most common cause of sudden death. It is also the most common cause of death in people over 65 years old. Men are 10 times more likely to get coronary heart disease than women.

[[Fructose]]

[[Peer pressure]]

CATEGORIES: Psychology

Peer pressure is being influenced by the peer group members. It often happens to children during puberty. The group defines some social values. For somebody to stay "cool" in that group, they feel as if they have to act like other people in that group. Social pressure (and wanting to be accepted or in favour inside the group) leads people to do things they would not do otherwise. For example, it can influence a person to smoke cigarettes or  marijuana, to drink alcohol, commit crimes, and/or many other things that they might regret. Through adolescents are seen adults from external physical point of view, they lack proper mental maturity. Similarly, they look physically matured and do not intend to be in children's group but adults also do not value them as adults. Therefore, they create peer group of their own age to enjoy themselves. They have strong faith and belief on the friends of the same groups. Because of the changes they experience, the new desires, aspirations and interests are developed. They become sensitive and sentimental.

When parents and society do not consider and address their needs, aspirations and desires, they feel dominated and leave home to pass most of their time with their friends on peer groups. Sometimes they cannot get proper counselling and guidelines in these stages. Consequently, sometimes, they can fall prey to many bad habits. there are many positives and negatives by peer pressure. 

Positive peer pressure, in which people are influenced to do nice things like give to charity, is usually a good thing.

[[Western Europe]]

CATEGORIES: Regions of Europe

Western Europe is a geographic region of Europe. This term does not have a precise definition. Its use has changed over time. During the middle ages, the European parts of the Western World included those countries following Catholicism or Protestantism. During the Cold War, Western Europe was a geographic and socio-political concept. It meant the democratic European countries of the First World, which are also vaguely defined. It was and still is distinguished from Eastern Europe by differences of economics, politics, and religion.  At its widest medieval definition, it includes the following 32 countries:

Many of these countries were members of the Western European Union. Many, such as Norway, are also in Northern Europe or in Central Europe or Southern Europe.

Today, the term Western Europe has to do with geography and with economics. The concept is commonly associated with liberal democracy, socialism and also with the European Union, though that also has some countries of Eastern Europe.

Most of the countries in the region share Western culture, and many have economic, and political ties with countries in North and South America and Oceania.

In addition, Scandinavia (in Northern Europe) is commonly associated with social democracy and remains fairly neutral throughout international disputes. The Iberian Peninsula, the most western part of Europe is similarly closely linked to the Americas.

Unlike most radio transmitters, maser waves tend to have very similar wavelengths. Their usage was first predicted by Albert Einstein. In the 1960s masers were made to emit optical wavelengths, and soon were called lasers.

[[Nectar]]

CATEGORIES: Flowers

Nectar, in botany, is a liquid made by the flowers of plants. It is sweet because it has sugar in it. Plants make nectar to attract pollinating animals. It is made in glands called nectaries. The nectaries are usually at the bottom of the perianth of the flower. This means the animal trying to get the nectar has to touch the parts of the plant that are used for reproduction. By doing this, the animal getting the nectar helps the plants reproduce.

Some plants make nectar outside the flower. These plants do it to attract predatory insects. These insects will eat both the nectar and any plant-eating insects found near the plant.

Nectar is economically important because it is where the sugar for honey comes from. It is also useful in agriculture and horticulture because the adults of many predatory insects, as well as hummingbirds, eat nectar. Some plants give off very rich scents, such as the Rocky Mountain Columbine

[[Athelstan]]

CATEGORIES: 890s births, 939 deaths, House of Wessex

Athelstan or  Æthelstan, (893/4–27 October 939), called the Glorious, was the first King of England. He reigned from 924 to 939. He was the son of King Edward the Elder. Athelstan's reign is sometimes overlooked but it was of great importance to political developments in the 10th century.

Athelstan was the son of Edward the Elder, and grandson of Alfred the Great. His father succeeded, after some difficulty, to the Kingdom of the Anglo-Saxons formed by Alfred. His father had also been the King of Mercia. When Edward died Athelstan quickly became King of Mercia but he was not immediately accepted as King of England. His brother, Ælfweard, had more support in England but died soon after Edward. This made it easier for Athelstan to become king.

For Athelstan it was very important to have many allies. A year after his crowning he married one of his sisters to the Viking King of Northumbria, Sithric. However, Sithric died only a year later, and Athelstan seized Northumbria. This move made him king of more land than any other before him, roughly the same as modern England. Historical records indicate that the other rulers in Great Britain accepted him as king at Bamburgh around this time.

Athelstan died at Gloucester in 939 and was succeeded by his half-brother, Edmund I.

Firefly is an American science fiction television series. It first aired in the United States and Canada on September 20, 2002. It is set in the future, but also has many things about it which would be expected in a story of the American Old West. This combination of past and future gives a unique science fiction setting for the story. It was created by writer and director Joss Whedon, creator of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel. He created it with his production company, Mutant Enemy. Whedon was the executive producer, along with Tim Minear.

Firefly was first broadcast on the FOX network. It was cancelled after only eleven of the fourteen episodes were shown. Even though the show did not last long, it sold very well when it was released onto DVD and had great fan support. Because of this, Whedon and Universal Pictures made a movie based on the series, titled Serenity. The movie was named after the fictional spaceship in the show.  It won an Emmy in 2003 for "Outstanding Special Visual Effects for a Series".

The series is set in 2517 AD. It follows the adventures of the crew of Serenity, a Firefly-class spaceship. The cast play the nine characters who live on Serenity. Whedon described the show as "nine people looking into the blackness of space and seeing nine different things". The show looks at the changing lives of people who fought on the losing side of a civil war. It also shows the pioneer culture that is on the edges of their star system. It is a future where the only two superpowers, the United States and China, joined to create a single government. This government was called the Alliance. This also caused the two cultures to blend into each other. Whedon said that nothing has changed in the future. There are more people with better technology, but they still have the same problems politically, morally and ethically.

[[Internet protocol suite]]

CATEGORIES: Internet, Computer protocols

When computers connect and transmit data between each other on the Internet, they follow a set of rules to do so. These rules are universal; all computers throughout the Internet must follow them. Otherwise, the Internet would not function as computers would not be able to transmit data in a meaningful and useful way. These rules are called protocols. There are many different protocols, each for different purposes, and they all together are called the Internet protocol suite. The two most important protocols are the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP), which ensure data is delivered at the right place, and without errors, and is what computers use when they access servers (computers that have the data that is accessed on the Internet) on the World Wide Web, as well as for email, and the like. Other protocols include the Network Time Protocol, which ensures clock synchronisation in computers, and there are many others.  

The TCP/IP model and other related protocols are maintained by the  Internet Engineering Task Force, whose parent organisation is the Internet Society, and which also cooperates closely with other standards bodies such as the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) and ISO/IEC.

The Ottonian rulers are also regarded as the first dynasty of the Holy Roman Empire, as successors of the Carolingian dynasty and Charlemagne, who is commonly viewed as the original founder of a new (Frankish) Roman Empire.

Although he was never Emperor, Henry I the Fowler, Duke of Saxony, was the founder of this imperial dynasty, since his election as German king made it possible for his son, Otto the Great to take on the imperium. Since Otto I most of the German kings were also crowned Holy Roman Emperor. Under the reign of the Ottonian rulers, the kingdom of the Eastern Franks finally became Germany as the duchies of Lorraine, Saxony, Franconia, Swabia, Thuringia and Bavaria joined in one empire. 

After the end of the Ottonian dynasty (with the death of Henry II in 1024) the crown passed to the Salian dynasty. Luitgard, a daughter of Emperor Otto I had married the Salian Duke Conrad the Red of Lorraine. His great-grandson was Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor.

[[Edward III of England]]

CATEGORIES: 1312 births, 1377 deaths, House of Plantagenet, 14th century in England

Edward III (13 November 1312–21 June 1377) was a King of England. He ruled for 50 years. 

He made England the strongest military power during his reign. 

Edward was crowned when he was fourteen years old, after his father was forced to abdicate. After his victory against the Scots, he declared himself heir to the French throne in 1337, and so started the Hundred Years' War. The war went very well for England; the victories of Crécy and Poitiers led up to the Treaty of Brétigny, by which he gained a lot of territory. When he became older, he was much less active, mostly a result of his bad health. He died of a stroke in 1377, aged 64.

Edward also established the Order of the Garter, and developed legislature and government. However, during his reign there was the Black Death. 

Edward and his wife, Philippa of Hainault, had many children and, as they traveled, the children were generally known by where they were born (though the oldest son, Edward "of Woodstock," became known to later generations as Edward, the Black Prince). Prince Edward died before his father Edward III, and his older son, Edward "of Angouleme," had died a child, so younger son Richard "of Bordeaux" succeeded Edward III as Richard II of England before being deposed by his cousin Henry IV of England, whose father, John "of Gaunt", had married the heiress of Lancaster. His family, the House of Lancaster, fought the Wars of the Roses with the House of York descended from the daughter of Edward III's son Lionel "of Antwerp" (who was older than John) over who was the rightful king. 

In his own time and for centuries after Edward III was praised a lot, but by Whig historians he was seen as an irresponsible adventurer. This view has turned, and modern historians see what a good king he was.

There is no permanent population of persons south of the Antarctic Circle. There are research centers from some nations on Antarctica.  Teams of scientists live in the research centers for part of the year. In past centuries some whaling stations were set up on Antarctica and some of the whalers would live there for a year or more. At least three children have been born in Antarctica. It is one of the coldest places on earth.The lowest temperature ever recorded on earth was recorded in Antarctica (-129.3)

[[Toast]]

CATEGORIES: Breads, Breakfast foods

Toast is bread which has been grilled until hot and crispy. A toaster, grill or open fire is used. Toasted bread is both darker in color and crunchier than normal bread. Toast can be eaten with a range of condiments spread on the surface, such as butter, jam, honey, and cheese to make cheese on toast, though these are optional as some people prefer their toast without condiments (dry toast).

Toast can also be used to make 'toasties', where a filling is compressed and heated between two slices of buttered bread in a toastie maker. Popular fillings include cheese, jam, peanut butter and chocolate spread.

[[Toaster]]

CATEGORIES: Cooking appliances

A toaster is a machine that cooks bread. The bread is put into the toaster and after a few minutes it pops up, toasted. The pop-up toaster was invented by Charles Strite in 1919.

[[Swiss cheese]]

CATEGORIES: Swiss cheeses

Swiss cheese is a name for a number of cheeses that are like Swiss Emmental cheese. This name is mostly used in the United States and Canada, and in most cases, the cheeses are made there and are not from Switzerland. Like it, they have holes, which are made by the bacteria that change milk into Swiss cheese. Propionibacterium uses the lactic acid that is made by other bacteria, and it gives off a gas called carbon dioxide. This slowly forms bubbles that become the holes. The holes in the cheese are called the "eyes", and a Swiss cheese that does not have holes is called a "blind" cheese.

Most often, Swiss cheeses with larger eyes have a better taste, as the same things that make the eyes bigger also make the taste of the cheese better. These include longer time and more warmth as the cheese is formed.

Emmental cheese has been produced in France, Germany, and Austria for a long time. This is why the names Emmental and Swiss Cheese can be used for kinds of cheese that are not made in Emmental in Switzerland but are made the same way.

[[Saint-Fons]]

CATEGORIES: Communes in Rhône

Saint-Fons is a French city next to Lyon. About 15.000 people live there. The name of the city does not come from a saint. It is because there are many fountains near the city. Originally the place name was Cent Fonts ( 100 sources), which was changed into the current city name. The city split from Vénissieux in the middle of the 19th century. The main reason for splitting was because of the chemical industry in the spot.

[[Incidental music]]

CATEGORIES: Musical forms

June 2017Incidental music is music which has been written for a play.  It is not like opera where there is usually music all the way through.  Incidental music will be used between scenes or for particularly important moments in the play or for songs sung by the actors.  It is called “incidental” because the music is not as important as the play.

Incidental music was used as long ago as the time of Ancient Greece.  It was used in the 16th and 17th centuries, especially in the plays of Shakespeare whose characters often sing songs.  At this time incidental music was used more often for comedies than for tragedies.  Tragedies were about important people who were busy ruling their country and having wars.  In the plays they spoke in verse and were too noble to sing.  People thought that comedies were more suitable for including music.  The songs were often sung by actors playing the parts of shepherds, nymphs or clowns.

In later centuries music was used for all types of serious drama.  Sometimes large orchestras were used.  Many famous composers wrote music to be played by an orchestra during plays.  A famous example is the incidental music for Shakespeare’s “A Midsummer Night's Dream” composed by Felix Mendelssohn in 1842.  Other composers worked with living poets such as Goethe and Schiller.  Beethoven wrote music for Goethe’s play Egmont.  This music is very closely linked to what happens in the story: the overture describes the harshness of the Spanish oppression of the Netherlands which is what the play is about.  Schubert’s famous Rosamunde overture comes from a play called Die Zauberharfe (The Magic Harp).  Schumann’s music for Manfred is different: it was never intended to be performed with the play, it was just inspired by Schumann’s imagination.  Many other composers wrote incidental music, e.g. Sibelius (for Maeterlinck’s play Pelléas et Mélisande) and Grieg (for Ibsen’s play Peer Gynt).

In all these examples the music is now usually heard at concerts, not as part of the original play.  Most of them have overtures (music played before the play starts) and these overtures are often performed separately, very often at the start of concerts.

Incidental music was not used so much during the 20th century although the plays of Brecht, which are often about political propaganda, needed a new kind of popular music.  Brecht worked with composers like Weill and Eisler who understood the kind of message that he wanted in his plays.  Their music for Brecht’s plays is similar to cabaret music.

Nowadays electronic music is often used in plays.

[[Kayak]]

CATEGORIES: Boats, Water sports

A kayak is a small boat that is driven by manpower.  It typically has a covered deck, and a cockpit covered by a spraydeck.  It is propelled by a double-bladed paddle by a sitting paddler.  The kayak was used by the native Ainu, Inuit,  Aleut and Eskimo hunters in sub-Arctic regions of northeastern Asia, North America and Greenland.  Modern kayaks come in a wide variety of designs and materials for specialized purposes.

Kayaks typically are built for one, two or occasionally three paddlers who sit facing forward in one or more cockpits below the deck of the boat.  The spray skirt or similar waterproof garment attaches securely to the edges of the cockpit, so that no water from waves or spray may enter the boat. Therefore, in most styles the boat can roll upright again without it filling with water or ejecting the paddler.

Kayaks differ distinctly in design and history from canoes, which are craft propelled by single-bladed paddles by a kneeling paddler, although some modern canoes may be difficult for a non-expert to distinguish from a kayak.  Kayaks are often called canoes in Great Britain and Ireland.

[[Canoe]]

CATEGORIES: Boats

A canoe is a small boat, that is often driven by manpower or womanpower, but also commonly sailed. Canoes are pointed at both ends and usually open on top, but can be covered. Canoes are known as "Paddle boats" in some small towns in the south of Australia. The use of a paddle or "salvatore" is used to propel the vehicle. The most famous of rowers include the Szwedo of Luke in which he was the first man to complete 4 laps the woodend river in less than 3 days, beating the record of 4 laps in 4 days.

The canoe is propelled by the use of paddles, with the number of paddlers depending on the size of the canoe (most commonly 2). Paddlers face in the direction of travel, either seated or kneeling. In this way paddling a canoe can be contrasted with rowing, where the rowers face away from the direction of travel. Paddles may be single-bladed or double-bladed.

[[Paddle]]

CATEGORIES: Tools

A paddle is a tool used for pushing against liquids, either for propulsion in a boat or for mixing liquids.

Paddles commonly used in canoes consist of a wooden, fibreglass or metal rod (the shaft) with a handle on one end and a rigid sheet (the blade) on the other end.  Paddles for use in kayaks are longer, with a blade on each end, and usually no handles. 

[[Mahdi]]

CATEGORIES: Islam

The Mahdi or Mehdi ('the rightly-guided one') is Islam's messiah or savior. It is said that he and the Prophet Jesus will change the world for the better, bringing God in all hearts, before Yaum al-Qiyamah (Day of the Resurrection).

[[Propulsion tools]]

CATEGORIES: Tools

Propulsion is the use of force to make movement.

For ground propulsion the first instrument was the wheel.

For water propulsion pole, paddle, oar and sail have been used.  Nowadays the most common types are underwater propellers.  Sails are still common, and historically represented the most important form of early propulsion for large ships. 

For air propulsion, the most common types are propeller and jet engine.  Others have been used experimentally.

[[Oar]]

CATEGORIES: Tools

An oar is a tool used to move a boat through water. Oars have a flat blade at one end.  The oarsmen grasp the oar at the other end. The difference between oars and paddles is that paddles are held by the paddler, and are not connected with the vessel.  Oars generally are fastened to the vessel. The use of oars is called rowing. An oar used at the stern (rear) of a boat to steer is called a steering oar.

[[Drama]]

CATEGORIES: Genres, Entertainment

Drama is a type of literature. A drama can be in the form of a novel, television show, movie, play or dance.

[[Trunk (botany)]]

CATEGORIES: Plant anatomy

The trunk is the main stem or "main woody axis of a tree".  In the lumber trade a severed trunk is a log. In botany it means the main structural member of a tree that is directly connected to the roots and which supports the branches.  The trunk is also often called the bole.  The trunk is covered by the bark, which protects the tree against damage and often differs markedly from the bottom of the trunk to the top, depending on the species.  The trunk, or bole, is the most important part of the tree for timber production. The tree trunk can be separated into five different layers: the heartwood, the sapwood, the vascular cambium, the inner bark, and the outer bark.

[[Edward II of England]]

CATEGORIES: 1284 births, 1327 deaths, House of Plantagenet, 1300s in England, 1310s, 1320s

Edward II (April 25, 1284–1327) of Caernarfon, was King of England from 1307 until he was removed from the throne in January 1327. His tendency to ignore his nobility, in favour of low-born favorites, led to political trouble and eventually to his removal from the throne. He is most remembered for a story about his alleged murder, which was linked to his reliance on the corrupt family of Hugh le Despenser, which has been seen by some as evidence of his homosexuality.

[[Richard III of England]]

CATEGORIES: 1452 births, 1485 deaths, House of York, Kings and Queens of England, Military people killed in action, People from Northamptonshire

Richard III (1452–1485) was an English king. He reigned from 1483 until 1485, as the last king from the House of Plantagenet.

Richard was part of the House of York during the Wars of the Roses. He was the younger brother of King Edward IV. When Edward IV died, his 12-year-old son became King Edward V. Richard was given the role of "Protector", meaning he would run the country until Edward V became an adult. But Richard III took the throne for himself. Soon after, Edward V and his younger brother disappeared while living in the Tower of London.

Many people started saying that Richard had ordered for the boys to be killed. Historians are not sure about this. Many of the House of York's supporters believed he had done it, and turned against him. He managed to put down a rebellion by his old friend the Duke of Buckingham, but faced another rebellion by Henry Tudor. This led to the Battle of Bosworth Field, in which Richard was killed and his army was lost. His body was buried quickly in a church in Leicester. In 2012, the body was rediscovered beneath a car park. It was reburied in Leicester Cathedral in 2015.

For many years, Richard III was seen as a villain. The Tudor kings and queens encouraged this, as did Shakespeare's famous play Richard III. Almost all writers at the time saw him as either a hero or a villain. In both the past and the present, some writers say that Richard III made many good laws despite being ruthless. Others argue that his ruthless behaviour was common for the powerful people of that time.

[[Olive]]

Olive can mean the things below:

[[Olive (fruit)]]

CATEGORIES: Fruits, Oleaceae

The olive (Olea europaea) is the fruit of the olive tree.  It is an important food crop in countries around the Mediterranean Sea, and places with a Mediterranean climate. 

It is a healthy food but rather fatty.  It has olive oil, one of the fattiest cooking oils in use, even more than palm, canola and other vegetable oils. Olive oil is the juice made by crushing olives. It is considered to be healthier alternative to sunflower oil.

In Roman literature, the olive branch is used as a symbol of peace: "extending the olive branch". In Christianity, too, it is seen as a symbol of peace, because according to the Bible, a dove brought an olive branch to Noah to show that the flood was over. Many writers and illustrators use olive branches around text to give it greater artistic credit (a similar effect is achieved with wheat). 

The raw olives are very bitter. They are "cured" mostly by bacterial fermentation. Later they may be alternately washed with water and packed with salt. The procedures vary a lot, and different varieties of olives get different treatment. The bitter chemical oleuropein, a phenol compound, has to be broken down or removed. This is what the curing process does. Even so, olives still often do have a rather bitter taste. There is a variety called "Kalamata" which grows around 

kalamata region in Greece. The olives which are eaten raw and have a very pleasant taste.

[[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions]]

CATEGORIES: Lists of sportspeople, Formula One drivers

The Formula One World Drivers' Championship (WDC) is the most successful Formula One race car driver of the year. The award is given by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) to the driver who scores the most points during a season.

The WDC was first awarded in 1950, to Giuseppe "Nino" Farina. The first driver to win more than one Championship was Alberto Ascari, in 1952 and 1953. The latest driver awarded the championship is called the reigning or defending champion. As of the end of the 2020 Formula One season, the reigning champion is Lewis Hamilton of Mercedes.

The FIA does not officially award the Championship until the end of the season. Sometimes one driver will be far ahead of the other drivers in points. Even if the leading driver scores no more points, none of the other drivers could pass his point total. When this happens, the driver is said to have clinched the Championship.

[[Propeller]]

CATEGORIES: Tools, Aviation

A propeller makes an aircraft, ship, or submarine in water or air go by making a big wind or a strong stream. It does this by turning two or more wings very quick.  The blades of a propeller act as rotating wings, and produce force through application of both Bernoulli's principle and Newton's third law, generating a difference in pressure between the forward and rear surfaces of the airfoil-shaped blades.

[[Fluid]]

CATEGORIES: Basic physics ideas

A fluid is a substance that can move easily and change shape such as water (liquids), or air (gases), or plasmas. They can 'flow'- flow and fluids both come from the same English word roots (Latin: fluere "to flow") and are pronounced similarly. The physics of fluids is called fluid mechanics.

Fluids usually take on the shape of their containers, in contrast to solids which maintain their own shape.

Some things are not exactly fluid and not exactly solid, such as Silly Putty. Powders are made up of small solids that appear to flow but don't actually.

Most fluids have a freezing point. At this temperature it becomes solid.

Currently, Women's Shelters are found around the United States, United Kingdom, and many other First World countries.  In these places, women are there to hide or are running away from abusive or dangerous situations. In these shelters, they are given food and a place to stay for an amount of time (usually 1-3 months at a time).  They are put into a support group and given a temporary counselor.  There is a high success rate in this type of place.

[[Semitone]]

CATEGORIES: Music theory

A semitone 

(British English) (also called a half step or a half tone) is the smallest musical interval used in Western music. It is the distance between two notes which are next to one another in pitch.

A whole tone means a distance of two semitones, i.e. the distance between two notes which are separated by one other note in pitch.

This is easy to see with a picture of a keyboard.  The distance between two white notes that are side by side may be a whole tone (if there is a black note in between them) or a semitone (if there is no black note between).

To go from a C to a C sharp (or D flat) is a semitone.

To go from a C sharp (or D flat) to a D is a semitone.

To go from a C to a D is a tone.

[[Butcher]]

CATEGORIES: Food-related occupations

A butcher is person whose job is to prepare and sell meat. Some butchers also kill the animals the meat is from. Butchers also prepare sausages, and other meat-products.

[[Hotlinking]]

CATEGORIES: Internet slang

Hotlinking is an internet term. It means displaying an image on a website by linking to the website hosting the image. The link gets the source data of the picture each time it is needed.

This avoids having the image on every website which uses it. So, a website owner uses a link to the picture such as http://example.com/picture.jpg. When the hotlinking website is loaded, the image is loaded from the original website, which uses its bandwidth, so it costs the hotlinked website money. For this reason many website owners use .htaccess files to prevent hotlinking. In some cases website owners use the .htaccess file to replace any hotlinked images with an offensive image to deter any other website owners from hotlinking. Hotlinked images are usually hosted on sites like imgur.

The original image may be owned by the original website. It might be wrong to make a copy of the original image file for use on a different web page, without being careful to get proper permission.

Hotlinking can also be used for file types other than images, including documents and videos.

[[Nuclear power]]

CATEGORIES: Nuclear energy

Nuclear power is the controlled use of nuclear energy.'  like uranium that can be released by nuclear reactions in a machine called a nuclear reactor.  This energy is made into electricity, which then can be used to power machines and heat homes. In 2007, 14% of the world's electricity came from nuclear power.  Nuclear power plants also make radioactive waste that could be harmful if it is not stored properly.

People have also been studying since the middle 20th century to use fusion power which produces much more energy and doesn't produce radioactive waste. Nuclear fusion reactors don't exist yet and are still being developed.

[[Software versioning]]

CATEGORIES: Software

Software versioning is a way to name different versions of computer software. A computer software has different states in its life-cycle process from Development through deployment into Production and Sustainment. Each state in the process is given a unique version and version number. Versions are most often a sequence of one to four numbers (for example, 12.2.3) to represent Major.Minor.Maintenance actions, but can also use names, dates, or other sequencing mechanisms.  In some practices, the numbers are used with variations like the 3rd digit being replaced by a letter (for example, 4.1a).  The changes are all revisions in that something is being changed and the version number tells people how complex the change is to the software.

Many times, after a program has been made, things called patches can be downloaded from the program's website. The patches usually make small updates or fixes to the main program, such as fixing bugs or updating information or program functions. When a patch is used, the program is advanced to the next version, advancing the version number by the appropriate level.

[[Sympathy]]

CATEGORIES: Emotions

Sympathy exists when the feelings or emotions of one person lead to similar feelings in another person so that they share feeling. Mostly sympathy means the sharing of unhappiness or suffering, but it can also mean sharing other (positive) emotions. In a broader sense, it can refer to the sharing of political or ideological sentiments, such as in the phrase "a communist sympathiser".

The psychological state of sympathy is closely linked with that of empathy, but is not identical to it. Empathy is understanding and feeling another person's emotions as they feel them, but makes no statement as to how they are viewed. 

Sympathy, by contrast, implies a degree of equal feeling, that is, the sympathiser views the matter similarly to how the person themselves does. It thus implies concern, or care or a wish to reduce negative feelings others are experiencing.

[[Puddle]]

CATEGORIES: Water

A puddle is a small mass of liquid, usually water, uncontained on a surface. It can form either in depressions in the surface, or directly upon the flat surface, held together by surface tension. A puddle is generally considered to be small enough to step over or shallow enough to walk through, and too small to traverse with a boat. 

Puddles commonly form during rainstorms, and can cause problems for transport, especially when combined with cold conditions to form patches of ice, which are highly slippery and difficult to see.

[[Beam (structure)]]

CATEGORIES: Architectural elements

A beam is a structural  element that carries structural load.  

Beams generally carry vertical forces, but can also be used to carry horizontal loads (Those loads can result from wind or an earthquake).  The loads that a beam carries are led to columns or walls, which lead the force to the next element.

Beams are characterized by their profile (their shape), their length, and their material.  In constructions of today beams are mostly made of steel, reinforced concrete, or wood.

[[Load]]

Load may mean:

[[Organ (music)]]

CATEGORIES: Keyboard instruments

In music, organ is a word that can mean several kinds of musical instruments. The word comes from the Greek ὄργανον organon, which means "organ", "instrument", or "tool".

Most organs are played using keyboards, one or more of which may be played using the feet. They are found and used in churches, concert halls, and even in theatres, especially older movie theatres or cinemas. A person who plays the organ is called an organist.

Here are some different types of organs:

[[Twin]]

Human twins are two people that shared the during a single pregnancy, and one is normally born quickly after the first. Because of the size of the uterus,

[[Ceiling]]

CATEGORIES: Architectural elements

A ceiling is the surface that covers the upper limit of a room. It is not generally considered a structural element, as it does not hold anything up. It simply conceals the underside of the floor or roof above it.

There are many different types of ceilings in architecture. In religious buildings, the ceilings are often decorated with frescos, mosaic tiles and other surface treatments. Perhaps the most famous example is the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, painted by Michelangelo.

[[Column]]

CATEGORIES: Architectural elements

A column in architecture is a vertical element that transmits the weight of the structure above to the structure below. Columns can be either a single piece or several pieces put together. Columns are frequently used to support beams or arches on which the upper parts of walls or ceilings rest. 

[[Identical twins]]

CATEGORIES: Biological reproduction, Developmental biology, Classical genetics

Identical twins start out as genetically identical: they have the same alleles. They are formed by a fertilised egg dividing into two separate individuals. They are always of the same sex, and are monozygotic or MZ twins (mono = one; zygote = fertilised egg). This contrasts with fraternal twins, who are formed by two separate eggs fertilised by two separate sperms, and who are not always the same sex (DZ = dizygotic). Both types of twin are carried in the same uterus at the same time, so their birth environment is the same.

Research shows that the frequency of monozygotic twinning is one in 240 births. Fraternal twins are twice as common. In vitro fertilization (IVF) techniques are more likely to create dizygotic twins. For IVF deliveries, there are nearly 21 pairs of twins for every 1,000.

[[Keyboard instrument]]

CATEGORIES: Keyboard instruments

A keyboard instrument is an instrument that is played by pressing the keys of a keyboard.  In a keyboard, the notes are arranged with naturals (usually white notes) forming the main body of the keyboard, and sharps and flats (usually black notes) placed in cuttings into the upper half of the naturals.

The ways in which the sound is made varies a lot:

In the 17th and 18th centuries, the word Clavier was used in Germany to mean any kind of keyboard instrument.  Often, the naturals were black and the sharps and flats were white (see picture of harpsichord), but the layout was exactly the same. 

The development of electronic instruments in the 20th century has brought about many different types of electronic keyboard instruments. These include the ondes Martenot and the synthesizer.

Nowadays, people often talk about a keyboard meaning an electronic keyboard (e.g. “He plays the keyboard”). The plural form of the word is "keyboards".

Yamaha have now made the most successful keyboards, selling over 770,000 a year

[[Bow (ship)]]

CATEGORIES: Ship building

The bow is the forward part of the  hull of a ship or boat, the point that is most forward when the vessel is underway. 

The bow is designed to reduce the resistance of the hull cutting through water and should be tall enough to prevent water from easily washing over the top of it. The bow is helpful for letting the ship smoothly pass through the ocean.

[[Sambucus]]

CATEGORIES: Berries, Dipsacales

Sambucus is a genus in the family Adoxaceae. It is commonly called Elder or Elderberry. It includes several similar types of shrubs that produce fruit that is also called elderberries. The plant can be found in swampy habitats and other areas that provide enough water.

Black Elderberry has been found to be effective against the H5N1 strain of Avian Flu (Zakay-Rones et al. 1995)March 2020. Black Elderberry contains a unique compound called Antivirin® that can help protect healthy cells and inactivate infectious viruses. When given to patients, scientists have found the Black Elderberry, has the ability to ward off flu infections quickly (Zakay-Rones 2004). Black Elderberries are rich in anthocyanins which are a type of flavonoid – anthocyanins are antioxidants that may protect cells from free radicals and support your body’s immune system.

Black Elderberries have almost 5 times as many anthocyanins as Blueberries and twice the overall antioxidant capability of cranberries

Black Elderberry has a more potent antiviral effect than Echinacea. At sites in Switzerland and Italy, researchers have uncovered evidence that the black elderberry may have been cultivated by prehistoric man, and there are recipes for elderberry-based medications in the records dating as far back as Ancient Egypt. Historians, however, generally trace the tradition of the elderberry’s healing power back to Hippocrates, the ancient Greek known as the “father of medicine,” who described this plant as his “medicine chest” for the wide variety of ailments it seemed to cure.

Over the centuries, elderberry has been used to treat colds, flu, fever, burns, cuts, and more than 70 other maladies, from a toothache to the plague. In the 17th century, John Evelyn, a British researcher, declared, “If the medicinal properties of its leaves, bark, and berries were fully known, I cannot tell what our countryman could ail for which he might not fetch a remedy the elderberry, either for sickness or wounds.”

Elderberry can grow in the form of a shrub or small tree, reaching up to 6 feet in height and width depending on the variety. It blooms during the spring or summer, and its flowers contain both male and female reproductive systems in the event that it is unable to reproduce through cross-pollination. It can be used to create a violet dye. 

[[Jambul]]

CATEGORIES: Tropical fruit, Trees, Myrtaceae

Jambul or Jamun or Jamblang or Jambhul जांभुळ (मराठी)(Syzgium cumini), Kaalo Jaam (Bangla) Naavar Pazham (Tamil) is an evergreen tropical tree in the flowering plant family Myrtaceae, native to India, Pakistan, Indonesia and Sri Lanka. It is also grown in other areas of southern Asia including Myanmar, Nepal and Afghanistan.  The tree was also introduced to Florida, USA in 1911 by the USDA, and is also now commonly planted in Suriname.  In Brazil, where it was introduced from India during Portuguese colonisation, it has spread out in the wild in some places, as many native birds such as thrushes, tanagers and the Great Kiskadee want their fruits.  The various names for this fruit are (in Java) plum, jambul, jamun, jaman, black plum, faux pistachier, Indian blueberry , jambol, doowet, jambolan and jambolão. Scientific synonyms include Syzygium jambolanum, Eugenia cumini and Eugenia jambolana.

A fairly fast growing species, it can grow as high as 30 metres, and can live more than 100 years.  Its dense foliage provides shade and is grown just for its ornamental value.  The wood is strong and water resistant.  Because of this it is used in railway sleepers and to install motors in wells. It is sometimes used to make cheap furniture and village dwellings though it is relatively hard to work on.

The Jamun tree starts flowering in March-April. The fragrant flowers of Jamun are small, nearly 5 millimetres in diameter.  This is followed by the fruit which appears in May-June and resembles a large berry. The berry is oblong and ovoid.  It is green when just appearing, pink when as it matures, and shining crimson black when fully ripe.  Another variety comes in white and some people say that it can be used as a medicine.  Jamun fruit is a mixture of sweet, slightly sub acid spicy flavour that stands out even after eaten since it turns the tongue into purple color. The fruit is universally accepted to be very good for medicinal purposes, especially diabetics.  The seed is also used in various alternative healing systems like Ayurveda, Unani and Chinese medicine for digestive ailments. The leaves and bark are used for controlling blood pressure and gingivitis.  Wine and vinegar are also made from the fruit.

[[Ilama (fruit)]]

CATEGORIES: Annona

The Ilama (Annona macroprophyllata), also known as the soncoya or sincuya, is a kind of fruit, and also the name of the tree that it grows on. The trees and fruits can be found in tropical Central America.  The name comes from the Spanish translation of the Nahuatl ilamatzapotl. Its rough translation is 'old woman's sapote'.  The name is also applied to a similar fruit, cabeza de negro  (A. pupurea) which is cultivated as an alternative to the cherimoya.  The cabeza de negro is similar in size to the Ilama but grey-brown in color with hard bumps on the surface, and orange flesh that tastes like mango or papaw.

The Ilama fruit is delicious when eaten ripe. It is either eaten on the half-shell or scooped out with a tool. The Ilama is usually chilled when served, it is sometimes served with a little cream and sugar to intensify the flavor, or with a drop of lime or lemon juice to bring in a tart and bitter tinge.

[[Governor General of Canada]]

CATEGORIES: Governors General of Canada, Heads of state

The Governor General of Canada is the person who represents Canada's Queen (or King). The Queen of Canada does not spend much time in Canada because she is also the Queen of several other countries.

The Governor General is technically chosen by the Queen and is allowed to use almost all of the Queen's powers. But most of the time neither the Queen nor the Governor General use their powers without advice from the Prime Minister of Canada.

Once in a while the Prime Minister may want something done that the Governor General is not allowed to do on her own. The Prime Minister must then go straight to the Queen, for example for the appointment of 4 or 8 extra Senators to Parliament.

[[Noah's Ark]]

CATEGORIES: Old Testament

Noah's Ark, according to the book of Genesis (chapters 6–9) in the Bible, was a ship that God instructed Noah to build to save himself, his family (except his son Canaan and his wife Naamah because they refused to come aboard the ark), and every kind of animal, because God was going to destroy the Earth by bringing about a great flood. It also says that the ark rested on the highest point in the area which was Mount Ararat, in what is now Turkey. 

The size of the ship was 300 by 50 by 30 ells, according to Genesis 6:14. This makes it about half the size of the ship RMS Queen Elizabeth 2, or 155.45 by 25.91, by 15.54 metres. It would have had about the same tonnage (weight) as the RMS Titanic.July 2010 

There have been many recorded sightings of the ark over the years, however no physical evidence has been proven to show that the ark is currently on Mount Ararat.

[[Spruce]]

CATEGORIES: Conifers

Spruce are trees of the genus Picea, a genus of about 35 species of coniferous evergreen trees in the Family Pinaceae, found in the northern temperate and taiga regions of the earth.

Spruces are large trees, from 20–60 (–95) m tall when mature, and can be distinguished by their conical form and their needles, that are attached singly to the branches in a spiral fashion. The needles are shed when 4–10 years old.

[[Christmas tree]]

CATEGORIES: Christmas

The Christmas tree is a tradition associated with the celebration of Christmas. It is normally an evergreen coniferous tree that is cut and brought into the home. In Europe, the tree is traditionally a Norway spruce tree.

The tree is decorated with Christmas lights and colourful ornaments during the days around Christmas. An angel or a star is often placed at the top of the tree. Fir trees outside the home may be decorated in a similar fashion. The custom of the Christmas tree has its origin among the Protestant peoples of Northern Europe. It is not a religious symbol. 

[[Cell division]]

CATEGORIES: Cell biology, Chromosomes

Cell division is the process by which a cell, called the parent cell, divides into two cells, called daughter cells. When the cell divides, everything inside it divides also. The nucleus and the chromosomes divide, and the mitochondria divide also.

In mitosis, an ordinary body (somatic) cell divides to make two daughter cells.

In meiosis, a cell divides twice, to produce four gametes (sex cells). The first division of meiosis is a special kind of cell division called a reduction division because the number of chromosomes is halved. The second division of meiosis is similar to mitosis.

Cells are the 'building blocks' of life, and cell division is a basic feature of life. For simple unicellular organisms like Amoebozoa, one cell division reproduces the entire organism. On a larger scale, cell division can create offspring from multicellular organisms, such as plants that grow from cuttings. But most importantly, cell division enables organisms that are able to sexually reproduce to develop from the one-celled fertilised egg (zygote). Cell division also allows for continual renewal and repair of the organism.

[[Temperate climate]]

CATEGORIES: Climate, Regions

In geography, temperate latitudes of the Earth lie between the subtropics and the polar circles. Average yearly temperatures in these regions are not extreme, not burning hot nor freezing cold. Temperate means moderate.

Unlike in the tropics, temperatures can change greatly here, between summer and winter. So, most places with a temperate climate have four seasons: summer, autumn, winter and spring. Other areas with a temperate climate can have very unpredictable weather. One day it may be sunny, the next may be rainy, and after that it may be cloudy. This is normal in summer as well as in winter. These are the main types of temperate climate:

[[Lithuanian language]]

CATEGORIES: Lithuania, Baltic languages, Languages of Europe

The Lithuanian language is a Baltic language. It is from Lithuania, spoken in a few countries in Europe, as well as in the Americas and Australia. 

Lithuanian and Latvian are the only remaining Baltic languages. Both languages have much in common. Lithuanian, however, adopted fewer words and phrases from German and other languages. However, many words were adopted into Lithuanian by Slavic languages long ago, but in 1920, Lithuanian philologist Jonas Jablonskis and others replaced them with native Lithuanian words.. 

There are two main dialects of Lithuanian. Samogitian is used mostly in West Lithuania, and the other that is widely used in the whole country is Aukštaitian (Highlanders' dialect). The standard Lithuanian comes from West Aukštaitian. 

The first book written in Lithuanian is Katekizmas by Martynas Mažvydas. It was published in East Prussia in 1547.

[[Gingivitis]]

CATEGORIES: Diseases and disorders of the mouth, Inflammation

Gingivitis is the inflammation of the gums around the teeth. Gingivitis may be caused by a buildup of plaque and tartar because the teeth have not been cleaned properly. It can also be a manifestation of a systemic disease, as in diabetes or AIDS.

Sometimes excessive brushing or flossing can wear out the gums causing gum recession.

If gingivitis is not treated by proper oral hygiene, it can lead to periodontitis, which is a more advanced state of gum disease, that affects the bone and is harder to treat.

[[Taiga]]

CATEGORIES: Forests, Biomes

The taiga  is a large area of coniferous forests. It covers most of inland Alaska, Canada, Sweden, Finland, inland Norway, northern Kazakhstan and Russia (especially Siberia), as well as parts of the northern continental United States.

In Canada, boreal forest is the term used to refer to the southern part of these forests, while "taiga" is used to describe the northern areas south of the Arctic tree line that separates it from tundra.

The trees are mostly pines, spruces and larches. The climate is cold winters and cool summers.

[[Conifer]]

CATEGORIES: Conifers

The Conifers are cone-bearing seed plants. Most are trees; some are shrubs. They are formally the Division Pinophyta or Coniferophyta.

Conifers are Gymnosperms. They are cone-bearing seed plants with vascular tissue. All living conifers are woody plants, and most are trees.

Living conifers are all in the order Pinales. Typical examples include cedars, cypresses, firs, junipers, kauris, larches, pines, redwoods, spruces, and yews.

Species of conifers can be found in almost all parts of the world, and are often the most common plants in their habitats, as in  the taiga. Conifers are of great economic value, and their wood is mainly used for timber and  paper making The wood of conifers is known as softwood, though yew wood is actually quite hard. The division Coniferae contains about 700 living species.

[[Binomial nomenclature]]

CATEGORIES: Taxonomy

In biology, binomial nomenclature is how species are named. The name of a species is made of two parts: one indicating the genus and one indicating the species. Binomial nomenclature means "two-part name" or "system of two-part names".

[[System]]

CATEGORIES: Systems, Systems theory, Basic English 850 words

A system  is a group of related things that work together as a whole. These things can be real or imaginary. Systems can be man-made things like a car engine or natural things like a star system. Systems can also be concepts made by people to organize ideas. 

A subsystem is a system that is part of some larger system. For example, in computer networking, a disk subsystem is a part of a computer system.

== Definition == 

One of the founders of physiology, Claude Bernard, took a big step when he noticed that the internal systems of the body tend to keep things the same even if they are disturbed. He called the functions which keep system stable as homeostasis. This led towards the ideas of error-correction, feedback and regulation. These are all typical of systems which have some kind of goal and can adjust their behaviour so as to correct errors.

[[Valencia orange]]

CATEGORIES: Citrus

The Valencia orange is an orange first made by the Californian agronomist William Wolfskill, on his farm in Santa Ana.  The orange was later sold to the Irvine Company, who later used half of its land to grow the orange.  Orange County is named after this orange because of its popularity.  The Irvine Company's Valencia operation later split from the company and became Sunkist.  Cultivation of the Valencia in Orange County had stopped by the mid-1990s because of rising property costs, which caused what remained of the Southern California orange industry to move to Florida. It is usually harvested between March and June. 

[[Papaya]]

CATEGORIES: Tropical fruit, Brassicales

Papaya is a tall herbaceous plant in the genus Carica; its edible fruit is also called papaya. It is native to the tropical region of America, mainly from southern Mexico to Central America. Now these plants are grown in all tropical regions of the world.

Papayas are plants of tropical regions and, for growth and fruit production, they need a warm climate. They cannot live with low temperatures.

This is now the only species in its genus. As a result of genetic research, the other species were put in three new genera.

[[Flowering plant]]

CATEGORIES: Flowering plants

Flowering plant (also called Angiosperm or Magnoliophyta) is the common name of land plant today together with the gymnosperms they make up the seed plants. They are different from the gymnosperms because angiosperms bear flowers, and have enclosed ovules. Gymnosperms bear naked seeds on cones or open structures.

A salmonberry (Rubus spectabilis) is a type of fruit. It is a bramble in the rose family Rosaceae. It is native and widespread in areas of Alaska, predominantly the southeast. It is also widespread in Washington State. They come in red and orange varieties. They fruit in early summer and are used by many to make jams, juices, and other such products. They are considered to be a weed and reproduce and spread rapidly. The berries can be eaten raw, straight from the source. They co-exist with huckleberries, blueberries, thimbleberries, and other such plants in the Tongass National Forest.  This fruit is related to the rose and are native to the west coast of North America from Alaska to Idaho.

[[Grape tomato]]

CATEGORIES: Tomatoes

A grape tomato is a small, usually oblong tomato.  They are similar in size to a small cherry tomato and they both have a similar taste, but the grape tomato also has the similar oblong shape of a plum tomato.  The tomatoes were introduced to the United States market in 1997 by grower Andrew Chu, who got them from Taiwan's Known-You Seed Co, though the majority of the production is by a company called Procacci Brothers, who market them as "Santa Sweets". They are considered a difficult crop to grow, as they do not produce as heavily as many cherry tomato varieties.

It is believed that the tomatoes originated in Southeast Asia.  They are eaten as bar snacks in some parts of Thailand.

[[Adolf von Henselt]]

CATEGORIES: German composers, Romantic composers, German pianists, 1814 births, 1889 deaths

Adolf von Henselt (born Schwabach, Bavaria, May 9 1814; died Warmbrunn (now Cieplice), Silesia, October 10 1889) was a German pianist and composer.  He had piano lessons from Hummel in Weimar.  When he was a young man he played in concerts all over Germany.  Then he went to Russia where he was very successful and he settled there to live.  He became pianist at the court of the tsar and taught the tsar’s children how to play the piano.

Henselt was known for his beautiful playing of the music of Chopin.  He was very good at playing widely spaced arpeggios and could make them sound very smooth (legato) even if he was not using the pedal.

As a composer he is mostly remembered today for a few of his short works which are often quite sentimental, e.g. Frühlingslied (Spring Song) and Si oiseau j’étais (If I were a bird).

[[Cherry tomato]]

The cherry tomato is a type of tomato that is a fruit. This type of tomato was originally developed in Israel.

[[Binary star]]

CATEGORIES: Binary stars

A binary star is two stars which orbit around each other. For each star, the other is its companion star. Many stars are part of a system with two or more stars. The brighter star is called the primary star, and the other is the secondary.

Binary stars are important in astrophysics because looking at their orbits allows scientists to find out their masses. From this is got the mass–luminosity relationship, and from this is got the masses of individual stars.

Binary stars are not the same as line-of-sight optical double stars, which look close together but are not connected by gravity. Optical double stars may actually be far apart in space, but binary stars are quite close together. The first person to discover and prove true binary stars was the Anglo-German astronomer William Herschel. He published the first catalogue of binary stars, and his son John Herschel found several thousand more and updated the catalogue. John Michell first suggested that double stars might be physically attached to each other when he argued in 1767 that the probability that a double star was due to a chance alignment was small.  William Herschel began observing double stars in 1779 and soon after that he published catalogs of about 700 double stars.

[[Imperial units]]

CATEGORIES: Imperial units

The Imperial units or the Imperial system is a collection of measurement units. An Act of Parliament in 1824 created it from traditional English units.

[[Tundra]]

CATEGORIES: Biomes

In physical geography, tundra is where the tree growth is hindered by low temperatures and short growing seasons. The term "tundra" comes from tūndâr which means 'uplands, tundra, treeless mountains.

There are three types of tundra: Arctic tundra, Antarctic tundra, and alpine tundra. In all of these types, the plants are mostly grass, moss, and lichens. Trees grow in some of the tundra. The boundary between the tundra and the forest is known as the tree line or timberline.The area itself encircles the Arctic Ocean of the Northern Hemisphere. The climate in a tundra biome consists of freezing cold and dryness in the winter and cold summers. The tundra ground is a barren place, often covered with rocks.

Most water on the tundra is frozen within the soil. The permanent frozen soil is called permafrost. Permafrost and fierce winds prevent large trees from growing deep roots. Plants in the tundra are small and grow close to the ground. Plants called cushions grow in tight clumps in the tundra, but lichens are the dominant plants. Lichens cover the rocks. The few trees that do grow on the tundra are dwarf willows and birch.

The deep and cold snow makes life in the tundra very difficult. Every animal must adapt in order to survive. Some have thick fur that turns white during the winter. Others find places to hibernate during the winter months. Some examples of animals that live in the tundra are: rodents, hares, sables, caribou, wolves, arctic foxes, bears, walruses, seals, and snowy owls.

[[Tree line]]

CATEGORIES: Trees, Ecology

The tree-line or timberline is the edge of the habitat at which trees can grow. Beyond the tree-line, they are unable to grow as conditions are too bad.

There are several types of tree lines defined in ecology and geology:

At the tree-line, tree growth is often not clear with the last trees forming low bushes. If it is caused by wind, these are known as krummholz, from the German for 'twisted wood'.

The tree line, like many other natural lines (lake boundaries, for example), appears well-defined from a distance, but upon close inspection, it is not that clear. Trees grow shorter until they simply stop growing.

[[Lift (force)]]

CATEGORIES: Force, Aviation

'thumb|350px|Forces on an aircraft wing 

The lift force, lifting force or simply lift is the sum of all the forces on a body that force it to move perpendicular to the direction of flow. 

The most common type of lift is that of a wing of an aircraft.  But there are many other common uses such as propellers on both aircraft and boats, rotors on helicopters, fan blades, sails on sailboats, and wind turbines.

While the common meaning of the term "lift" suggests an "upwards" action, lift can be in any direction. For instance, for a sail the lift is horizontal, and for the wing on a race car the lift is down.

There are a number of ways of explaining the production of lift; some are more complicated than others, some have been shown to be false. The simplest explanation is that the wing deflects air downward, and the reaction pushes the wing up. 

[[Tropics]]

CATEGORIES: Regions

The tropics are the region of the Earth near to the equator and between the Tropic of Cancer in the northern hemisphere and the Tropic of Capricorn in the southern hemisphere. This region is also referred to as the tropical zone and the torrid zone.

This area includes all the areas of the Earth where the sun reaches a point directly overhead at least once a year. The word "tropics" comes from Greek tropos meaning "turn", because the apparent position of the Sun moves between the two tropics within a year.

The word Tropical specifically means places near the equator. The word is also sometimes used in a general sense for a tropical climate, a climate that is warm to hot and moist year-round. This includes tropical rainforests with lush vegetation. However, there are mountains in the tropics that are anything but "tropical" in this sense, with even alpine tundra and snow-capped peaks, including Mauna Kea, Mt. Kilimanjaro, and the Andes as far south as the northernmost parts of Chile and Argentina. Places in the tropics which are hot and dry include the Atacama Desert, Sahara Desert, Central Africa, most parts of Western Africa and Northern Australian Outback.

Some parts of Eurasia are also in the torrid zone.

People in some tropical places call their seasons "dry"/"hot" and "rainy"/"wet", especially where the seasons are made by monsoons. Tropical cyclones form in tropical ocean areas, and some move from there into the temperate zone. Tropical plants and animals are native to the tropics or the Torrid zone.

[[Mount Kilimanjaro]]

CATEGORIES: Mountains of Africa, Geography of Tanzania

Kilimanjaro (or Kilimanjaro, which means "shining mountain" in Swahili), formerly Kaiser-Wilhelm-Spitze, is a mountain in northeastern Tanzania. Kilimanjaro is the tallest free-standing mountain rise in the world, rising 4600 meters (15,000 ft) from the base, and is the highest peak in Africa at 5,895 meters (19,340 ft). It gives a dramatic view from the surrounding plains.  Almost 85% of the ice cover on Kilimanjaro disappeared from October 1912 to June 2011.

Kilimanjaro is also a strato-like volcano. It has explosive eruptions. The last major eruption was about 100,000 years ago. killimanjaro is 5895 meters tall.

[[Tropical climate]]

CATEGORIES: Ecology, Köppen climate classifications

A tropical climate is a type of climate typical in the tropics. It is a damp climate in which all twelve months have mean temperatures above 18°C (64.4 °F). 

Some tropical areas have rainfall throughout the year, usually in the afternoon. Others have a wet season and a dry season, for example because of monsoon. The Tropical climate is humid and wet. One famous area of tropical climate is the Amazon rainforest. A few places near the equator, such as Mount Kilimanjaro, are high mountains and cold for that reason.

[[Alpine tundra]]

CATEGORIES: Ecozones

Alpine tundra is a type of geological terrain. It is to be found at high enough altitude at any latitude on Earth. Alpine tundra lacks trees. The lower parts do not have permafrost. Because of this they are generally better drained than permafrost soils. Alpine tundra changes to subalpine forests below the tree line.

Because alpine tundra is in many different widely separated regions of the Earth, there is no animal species found in all areas of alpine tundra.

Some animals of alpine tundra environments include the Kea parrot, marmot, Mountain goats, chinchilla, pika, golden eagle and snow leopard. Plants include mosses, lichens and poor grasses. Some dwarf trees like birch and alder grow in tundras.

[[Köppen climate classification]]

CATEGORIES: Climate

The Köppen climate classification is one of the most widely used climate classification systems.  It was developed by Wladimir Köppen, a German climatologist, around 1900 (with several further modifications by himself, notably in 1918 and 1936).  It is based on the concept that native vegetation is the best expression of climate, thus climate zone boundaries have been selected with vegetation distribution in mind.

Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a set of actions that should be done if a person stops breathing, or if their heart stops.  The goal of CPR is to force blood and oxygen to keep flowing through the body.  Every part of the body needs blood and oxygen to survive.  CPR does not start a person's heart again.  However, it can keep pushing blood and oxygen around the body long enough that sometimes, it can keep the body from getting damaged by not having enough oxygen.

There are different types of CPR.  Regular people, who are not medical professionals, can do these things:

CATEGORIES: 1865 births, 1957 deaths, 20th century composers, Deaths from cerebral hemorrhage, Disease-related deaths in Finland, Finnish composers

Jean Sibelius (born Hämeenlinna (Tavastehus) 8 December 1865; died Järvenpää, 20 September 1957) was a Finnish composer. He is one of the most famous people from Finland and one of the greatest composers of symphonies of all times. He was born at a time when Russia had a lot of power in Finland and the Finnish people were trying hard to keep their own culture and their independence. This nationalism can be heard in a lot of his music, especially some of the choral music. After 1928 he composed very little. He lived in retirement in his home in the Finnish countryside.

[[Schutzstaffel]]

CATEGORIES: 1925 establishments in Europe, 1945 disestablishments in Germany, War crimes, SS, 1920s establishments in Germany

The De-Schutzstaffel.ogg (SS) was a large security and military organization controlled by the National Socialist German Workers Party (Nazi Party) in Germany.  "SS" was sometimes written in Runic as , and this symbol was put on the SS flag and insignia.

The SS played a major part in The Holocaust.  For example, they ran the Nazi concentration camps and death camps, where they killed millions of people.  After World War II, judges at the Nuremberg Trials ruled that the SS was an illegal criminal organization. The judges also said that the SS was the organization that had done most of the Holocaust.

==The SS is created== 

The SS was created in the 1925 to guard Nazi leader Adolf Hitler.  (Schutzstaffel means "Protection Squadron" in German).pp.26-29  From 1929 to 1945, Heinrich Himmler led the SS.  During that time, the SS grew from a small paramilitary unit to one of the largest and most powerful organizations in Nazi Germany.p.47

The Nazis saw the SS as a special unit, like the Praetorian Guard (which used to guard Roman emperors).  To be chosen for the SS, a person had to be racially "pure". This meant they had to prove that all their ancestors were "Aryan".  They also had to be completely loyal to the Nazi party.  They could never ask questions or disagree with anything the SS did.

[[Logarithm]]

CATEGORIES: Mathematics, Functions and mappings

Logarithms or logs are a part of mathematics. They are related to exponential functions. A logarithm tells what exponent (or power) is needed to make a certain number, so logarithms are the inverse (opposite) of exponentiation.  Historically, they were useful in multiplying or dividing large numbers.

The most common types of logarithms are common logarithms, where the base is 10, binary logarithms, where the base is 2, and natural logarithms, where the base is e ≈ 2.71828.

William Penn (14 October 1644-30 July 1718) was an English colonial leader. He was very wealthy and owned slaves who he forced to work on his plantation. He was given what would become the US state of Pennsylvania by King Charles II as a debt to his father. Penn was a member of the Religious Society of Friends, who are known as Quakers.

Penn and his wife were made honorary United States citizens in 1984 by US President Ronald Reagan. He was friends with George Fox.

George Herman "Babe" Ruth, Jr.  (February 6, 1895 – August 16, 1948) was a famous baseball player during the 1910s and 1930s in Major League Baseball. He played with the Boston Red Sox, New York Yankees, and the Boston Braves, and hit 714 home runs in his career. Only two players, Hank Aaron and Barry Bonds, have hit more. At the beginning of his career, he was a pitcher. He is widely considered the greatest baseball player of all time.

[[Korn]]

CATEGORIES: American heavy metal bands, Grammy Award winners, Nu metal bands, American hard rock bands, Alternative metal bands, People from Bakersfield, California

Korn (sometimes written as KoЯn to fit their logo) is an American Grammy Award-winning nu metal and alternative metal band from Bakersfield, California.

The band was first called 'Creep' and had another singer.

People often say they created the nu metal genre. Along with other bands of the time, they were influences for a wave of nu metal, alternative metal and rap metal bands through the mid 1990s and early 2000s, helping Limp Bizkit (who were discovered by Korn themselves) and Slipknot more than other bands. Despite this, Korn have been quoted for disliking the term and even being called 'metal'. Jonathan Davis has said that Korn's music can not be classified and that it contains many other influences besides simply 'metal'. The official review on the iTunes Store for their first album goes as far as saying that Korn "hate the term".

Their first album was first sold in 1994 and also called KoRn. Since then, Korn has sold over 35 millions records worldwide - including 16,5 millions in the U.S., making them one of the best-selling metal acts of the last twelve years. The band's catalogue consists of seven platinum studio albums in a row, one platinum compilation album, and seven consecutive debuts (including Greatest Hits, Volume 1 compilation album) in top 10 of Billboard Top 200 best selling albums. Korn has been selected for 6 Grammys, and won 2 such awards. 8 of their albums has been awarded as multi-platinum, despite only part of them being on Billboard.

[[Aspirin]]

CATEGORIES: Analgesics

Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) is a drug. It is most commonly used as a pain killer, or to reduce fever or inflammation.  It also has an anti-platelet effect - it reduces the number of platelets in the blood which reduces blood clotting- in that function it is used to prevent heart attacks.  Aspirin is one of the most-used medical drugs in the world.

There are some possible side-effects to this drug. For example, large amounts can damage the kidneys. Children taking aspirin can develop Reye's syndrome which causes the liver to become fatty and not work properly and also the brain to become enlarged. Reyes syndrome can be fatal, but most children survive it with treatment.

People with lung, kidney disease, gout, hyperuricemia (high amounts of uric acid in the blood), hemophilia (a blood clotting disorder), diabetes or high blood pressure should not take aspirin except on the advice of a qualified medical professional. Nor should people who are allergic to it, to ibuprofen or to naproxen. People with asthma where attacks are brought about by aspirin should avoid using any anti-inflammatory drugs based on it.

Aspirin was invented in Germany in 1897. Bayer has a trademark on the brand name "aspirin" in 80 countries. But in other countries, "aspirin" is the common name for the drug.

[[Víctor Jara]]

CATEGORIES: Chilean singers, 1932 births, 1973 deaths, Former Roman Catholics

Víctor Jara (September 28, 1932- September 15, 1973) was a singer from Chile, South America. 

He was born into a family of very poor peasants but through a lot of hard work and effort was able to enter the University of Chile - something very unusual in a poor country like Chile. In this manner he was able to escape the poverty of his parents. 

At University he studied dramatic arts or acting; he taught and directed theatre productions. During this time he met and married  Joan Turner, a British ballet dancer and choreographer who worked in Chile. 

Later Víctor Jara started to write and sing songs. He began to sing songs about the life of humble and poor people in his country: peasants, factory workers, miners, abandoned children, poor women. He also dedicated music albums to people who live in the shanty towns. 

Víctor Jara tried to use his music to bring awareness about the inequality between the richest and the poorest people in society. How poor folk have a hard time acquiring the most basic things, such as food, health care, education, and housing. He also supported politicians who called for a fairer distribution of wealth to end poverty. 

In 1973 Víctor Jara was killed by a military dictatorship led by General Augusto Pinochet for singing songs about social problems and social injustice. The U.S. government of Richard Nixon supported the military regime.

[[WWE]]

CATEGORIES: WWE

World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc., doing business as WWE, is a big company that produces professional wrestling shows. It is now the most popular company in the wrestling business. Vince J. McMahon started the company in 1963. His son, Vince K. McMahon is currently the chairman and CEO of the company and runs the company along with his daughter Stephanie McMahon and her husband Paul Levesque, better known as Triple H.

The company used to be known as the World Wrestling Federation or the WWF. They changed their name to World Wrestling Entertainment after a lawsuit filed by the World Wide Fund for Nature, formerly known as the World Wildlife Fund, which uses the "WWF" initials in the United States. In 2011, the company rebranded itself as WWE, although its legal name is still World Wrestling Entertainment.

[[Scutellosaurus]]

CATEGORIES: Thyreophora, Jurassic dinosaurs

Scutellosaurus was a small bipedal herbivorous dinosaur from the Lower Jurassic period, 200–196 million years ago. It was about a metre long.

Its back was armoured, and it is placed in the Thyreophora with the other armoured dinosaurs. It was one of the earliest members of this group, and the most basal (primitive) form so far known. Its closest relatives may have been Emausaurus and Scelidosaurus. These, and the larger armoured dinosaurs Ankylosaurus, Stegosaurus and Huayangosaurus, were all quadrupedal. The lightly built bipedal Scutellosaurus is similar in form to the ancestral dinosaurs, which were bipedal.

[[London Eye]]

CATEGORIES: Buildings and structures in London, Ferris wheels

The London Eye is a large metal Ferris wheel. It is also known as the Millennium Wheel and is one of the largest observation wheels in the world. Since mid-January 2015 it has been known in branding as the Coca-Cola London Eye, after an agreement signed in September 2014. The London Eye is at the western end of Jubilee Garden, on the South Bank of the river Thames, between Westminster Bridge and Hungerford Bridge.

The Eye was opened in 2000.  It is 135 metres high(442ft). At the time it was built, in 1999, it was the tallest giant wheel in the world, and at present it is Europe's tallest Ferris wheel. It offered the highest public viewing point in London. The 245 observation deck on the 72nd floor of The Shard is now the highest public view of London. 

It is the most popular paid tourist attraction in the United Kingdom: there are over 2.2 million visitors annually, and the Eye has made many appearances in popular culture.

The London Eye was overtaken in height by the Star of Nanchang, which is 160 meters high. On the 11th February 2008, the Singapore Flyer overtook the Star of Nanchang with 165 meters. It is known as the Coke Cola London Eye.

[[Finlandia (Symphonic Poem)]]

CATEGORIES: Compositions by Jean Sibelius, 19th century songs

Finlandia is a symphonic poem by the Finnish composer Jean Sibelius. He wrote it in 1899 and made some changes to it the next year. "Finlandia" is the Latin name for Finland. At the time Sibelius wrote it, Finland was called the "Grand Duchy of Finland". This was because it was being ruled by Russia. The Finnish people wanted to rule Finland for themselves. The music was composed for a pageant to encourage the Finnish people to work for freedom.

The music of Finlandia is exciting and dramatic. It sounds like the Finnish people struggling to be free. Towards the end the music becomes calm and a lovely tune is played. It is a hymn tune which became known as Finlandia. Many years later Sibelius set some words to this hymn and it is often sung as a separate piece by a choir. The words were written by Veikko Antero Koskenniemi. It has become Finland's best known song and almost feels like a second Finnish national anthem. It is often sung as a hymn in Christian churches to the words "Be still, my soul: the Lord is on your side". The tune was also used as the national anthem of the short-lived African country Biafra.

[[Transpiration]]

CATEGORIES: Plant physiology

Transpiration is the evaporation of water from plants, especially leaves. It is a type of translocation and part of the water cycle. The amount of water lost by a plant depends on its size, the light intensity, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and soil water supply. The process of  Transpiration helps in regulating temperature in the plant. 

Transpiration was first worked out by Stephen Hales (17 September 1677 – 4 January 1761), an English clergyman.  He proved what is still believed, that the evaporation of water molecules from leaves is the main force pulling the water column up from its origin in the roots.

[[Stomata]]

CATEGORIES: Plant anatomy, Cells, Plant physiology

In botany, a stoma (plural = stomata) is a tiny opening or pore. It is found on plant leaves and stems, and any other green parts of the plant. It is used for gas exchange. Stomata are mostly found on the under-surface of plant leaves. Almost all land plants have stomata.

Stomata have two main functions. First is gaseous exchange i.e. intake of carbon dioxide and release of oxygen. The second is the process of transpiration in plants.

Air enters  the plant through these openings.  The carbon dioxide is used in photosynthesis.  Some of the oxygen produced is used in respiration.  Surplus oxygen exits through these same openings.  Also, water vapor goes into the atmosphere through these pores in transpiration.

The pore is formed by a pair of cells known as guard cells. These adjust the size of the opening by opening or closing. To open a guard cell, protons  (hydrogen ions, H+) are pumped into the guard cells. Water enters into them, the cells gets filled, and they open.

[[Famine]]

CATEGORIES: Social sciences, Disasters, Agriculture

Famine is a situation where most people do not have enough food to eat. Without food, the human body grows weaker and weaker until the person becomes very sick or dies (see malnutrition). In poor countries with much subsistence farming such as in parts of Africa and Latin America, famine can be common.

[[Frequency modulation]]

CATEGORIES: Radio technology

In telecommunications and signal processing, frequency modulation transmits information over a carrier wave by varying the frequency.  This technique is different from amplitude modulation which varies the amplitude, but keeps the frequency constant. This kind of modulation is used in broadcasting and other radio work.

In the context of broadcasting, Frequency modulation is often shortened to FM. When transmitting analogue sound,  the sound quality of FM signals is better than that of amplitude modulation (AM) signals. However, FM signals do not travel as far as AM beause they use higher frequencies that do not bounce off the Kennelly–Heaviside layer.

Many radio stations send out both kinds of signals. AM may be used for talk shows, and FM for music. FM broadcasting usually includes a difference signal, which can cause two different speakers at home to create different sounds. This creates stereo sound.

[[Monty Hall problem]]

CATEGORIES: Mathematics

The Monty Hall problem is a famous problem in probability (chance). The problem is based on a television game show from the United States, Let's Make a Deal. It is named for this show's host, Monty Hall.

In the problem, there are three doors. A car (prize of high value) is behind one door and goats (booby prizes of low value) are behind the other two doors. First, the player chooses a door but does not open it. Then the host opens a different door. The host knows what is behind every door, and always chooses a door with a goat behind it. (If there are goats behind both other doors, one is chosen at random.) Last, the player choose whether to keep what is behind the first door or to change to the third door (the one the host did not open).

The rules of the problem are that the host has to open a door with a goat behind it and the player has the opportunity to switch. The question is whether changing choices increases the chances of getting the car.

Most people feel that the car is equally likely to behind either of the two doors that are still closed, so that changing doors does not affect the chance of getting the car. The true answer is that changing choices increases the chances of getting the car from 1/3 (one out of three) to 2/3 (two out of three).

That 2/3 (two out of three) chance comes from the fact in the initial door choice, the player has a 1/3 (one out of three) chance of picking the door with the car. There is a 2/3 (two out of three) chance if the car is behind one of the other two doors. If the player could switch from their one'' door to the other two doors this would improve their chances. The fact that the host reveals that one of the other doors contains a goat does not change this probability. The player is still effectively swapping their one door for the other 'two''' (even though one of them has been opened).

These are the options:

1. (Lose): If the player picks the car, then the host will show a goat. Then if the player changes their choice, they will get a goat .

2. (Win) : If the player picks a goat, then the host will show the other goat. Then if the player changes their choice, they will get a car.

3. (Win) : If the player picks the other goat, then the host will show the first goat. Then if the player changes their choice, they will get a car.

So, it is true that if the player changes (switches) then the player will win a car two times out of three.

[[Emergency telephone number]]

CATEGORIES: Emergency services, Telephone numbers

An emergency telephone number is a telephone number that can be used to quickly contact emergency services for assistance. Emergency services usually include police, medical, or firefighting public services. Many countries' public telephone networks have a single emergency telephone number, sometimes known as the universal emergency telephone number or the emergency services number. Most emergency service numbers are 3 digits long so that they can be dialed quickly and remembered easily. Some countries have a different emergency number for each of the different emergency services and are different only by the last digit. 

[[Classified]]

Classified could mean:

[[Satellite city]]

CATEGORIES: Cities, Social sciences

Satellite cities are smaller cities that are near to a large city that is the center of a metropolitan area. They are different from suburbs, subdivisions and bedroom communities because they have their own centre. Satellite cities could be separate cities outside of the larger metropolitan areas. However, working as part of a metropolis, a satellite city gets "cross-commuting" (people living in the city working outside of the city and people from other places working in the city). For example, London has several satellite cities, like Brentwood, Crawley and Chelmsford. New Haven and Bridgeport are among the satellites of New York City. Ipswich, Queensland, is a satellite to Brisbane (Australia) and Kitchener and Guelph, to Toronto (Canada). 

Satellite cities are almost self sufficient in terms of amenities and facilities. They usually have all of the things to term them as a separate city but they rely on the parent city or the nearby larger metropolitan area for some of their needs like education or employment.

[[Shanty town]]

CATEGORIES: Social sciences, Shanty towns

Shanty towns are slums on the outskirts of many cities – especially in third world countries. Normally there are not many shanty towns in more economically developed countries. Often of low cost, with houses badly built with plywood, corrugated metal, sheets of plastic, cardboard or any available material. Often irregular structures good enough to keep the rain away or to protect from the summer sun. Pets and animals are often left to roam for food and water.

Lack of clean water, sanitation and toilets often make people, especially children, more exposed to illnesses such as hepatitis and cholera.

Many are built on land without a permit and often have no roads,  numbered street, electricity or telephone lines. Some homes in shanty towns have some services but they are unkept and pose health and fire hazards. Sometimes shanty towns can take up whole parts of a city and may include millions of dwellers  – such as in the cities of Brazil- see Favelas.

Many shanty town settlements are built on the banks of rivers and as a result the residents suffer the effect of floods or from industrial toxins in the water. Some are built close to rubbish dumps.

Residents of shanty towns often have poor health, lack education, suffer from high levels of crime and suicide, and have a shorter life expectancy. 

[[Pterodactyloidea]]

CATEGORIES: Pterosaurs

Pterodactyloidea is the suborder of short-tailed pterosaurs. Their fossil record starts in the middle Jurassic. They became extinct in the K/T extinction event at the end of the Cretaceous period. Pterodactylus, Pteranodon and Quetzalcoatlus are in this suborder.

In 2014 remains of the earliest pterodactyloid was found in China. It is called Kryptodrakon. Its minimum age was 162.7 million years ago (mya). This is about five million years older than any previously known confirmed specimens.

Recent work shows that the group had more variety at the end of the Cretaceous than was thought earlier. In the early 2010s, several new pterosaur taxa were discovered dating to the late Cretaceous. These finds include some small sized pterosaur species.

At the end of the Cretaceous period, the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, which made all non-avian and most avian dinosaurs, as well as many other animals, extinct. The pterosaurs seem to have gone extinct in this event.

[[Michael Praetorius]]

CATEGORIES: 1571 births, 1621 deaths, Baroque composers, German composers, German organists, Music theorists, People from Thuringia

Michael Praetorius (born Creuzburg an der Werra, near Eisenach 15 February 1571? ; died Wolfenbüttel, 15 February 1621) was a German composer, organist and music theorist. He was one of the most important composers of his day and he wrote lots of different kinds of music. A lot of his music is based on hymns of the Protestant church.

We are not quite certain about the date of his birth. He was born at a time when there was a lot of argument about religion in Germany. His father was a strict Lutheran and lost his job more than once because of his beliefs. We know very little about the life of Praetorius. He seems to have gone to the Lateinschule (“Latin School”) in Torgau where he had music lessons from Michael Voigt. He probably never had music lessons after he left school. Then he went to the University of Frankfurt an der Oder. There Praetorius graduated in divinity. Afterwards he found a job as organist to the Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel. He soon earned a good salary. He married in 1603 and had two sons.

Although he had his job in Wolfenbüttel for many years he also worked a lot in Dresden where he met Heinrich Schütz and in Magdeburg where he met Samuel Scheidt. His health was not good, possibly because he worked so hard. When he died he left a lot of money to the poor.

[[Prometheus]]

CATEGORIES: Titans

Prometheus, is a  Titan in Greek mythology. He is the son of Iapetus and Clymene. He created humans, originally made out of gold. He also stole fire from Zeus and gave it to humans. As punishment, Zeus had Prometheus chained to a mountain. Every day an eagle (symbol of Zeus) would come and eat his liver. Prometheus is immortal, so he never died, and his liver grew back every night. But he still felt great pain.

After a long time, Zeus sent his son Heracles to free Prometheus by breaking the chains which held him.

Aeschylus wrote a play about Prometheus.

[[Pitch (music)]]

CATEGORIES: Sound, Musical terminology

In music, the pitch of a note means how high or low the note is. In physics, it is measured in a unit called Hertz.  A note that is vibrating at 261 Hz will be caused by sound waves that vibrate at 261 times a second.  This will be Middle C on the piano. 

Not all musical instruments make notes of a certain pitch.  Many percussion instruments like drums, triangles and cymbals are instruments used for rhythms.  They do not play tunes because they have no definite pitch (although often a definite pitch can just be heard when listening carefully.)

Some musicians have a sense of absolute pitch or pitch perfect.  This means that they always know what note is being played, even without comparing it to another note.  Having a sense of absolute pitch does not necessarily make someone a good musician, although it can be very useful.

There is evidence to suggest that well-known composers of classical music, such as Haydn, Beethoven, Mozart, and Bach, had developed and perhaps even mastered their sense of pitch.

Pitch is often confused with frequency. Frequency is used as a scientific means for measuring and changing sound and its possible pitches, though pitch is used to describe a more psychological. 

[[Congregation]]

CATEGORIES: Religion

A congregation is a group of people who have come together (congregated) for something, usually for religious worship.  In Christian churches the word “congregation” is often used to mean all the people in the main part of the church, but not the choir or the priests. This term came from long ago after the church was first formed. For example: the order of service might say that the choir will sing verse 1 of a hymn and "the congregation are asked to join in at verse 2".

[[Soursop]]

CATEGORIES: Annona

The soursop, also known as the zuurzak, is the fruit of the tree Annona muricata. The tree is from warm parts of the Americas. At first it was only found in the Caribbean islands, parts of Central America and parts of South America. Now it is grown in other warm and wet places, such as the Pacific Islands, Florida and Southeast Asia.

This fruit is large. It has a spiky green skin, which is not eaten. The inside of the fruit is white. It contains a sweet but sharp-tasting juice. The soursop contains black or brown seeds that are not eaten. The fruit can be eaten raw, or it can be made into juice for drinking. The juice is used to make candy and ice cream.

Some people use the soursop fruit or leaves as a medicine. Although the fruit contains sugars and a lot of vitamins, it may not be good to eat a lot of it. Scientists think that the soursop may make some people ill.

[[Vegetation]]

CATEGORIES: Botany, Ecology

Vegetation means the plant life of a region or the plant community. It means all ground cover by plants, and is the main element of the biosphere. When you say vegetation you do not think of any species composition, life forms, structure, spatial extent, "naturalness", or any other specific botanical or geographic characteristics. That is meant by flora which refers exclusively to species composition.

Vegetation can refer to a wide range of spatial scales. Primeval redwood forests, coastal mangrove stands, sphagnum bogs, desert soil crusts, roadside weed patches, wheat fields, cultivated gardens and lawns; all are meant by the term vegetation.

[[Player killing]]

CATEGORIES: Video games

Player Killing (PKing) is a part of online gaming with real people. It is when you kill another person's character. Some other terms in pking are: PJing, which means pile jumping, or attacking someone when they are picking up the items dropped by a player they have just killed a player, Safer, which means someone who PKs safely (especially when eating or healing) and does not take risks, making it widely considered 'unfair' on the people trying to PK them and DD which means death dot, which is when people in a Player Killing team all stand in the same place as each other, making it appear to other players that there is only one person there. However, "safing" varies in how other people perceive it. It can be used to stay alive, however you usually lose a chance to hit when healing.

[[Sebaceous gland]]

CATEGORIES: Glands, Integumentary system

The sebaceous glands are microscopic (tiny) glands in the skin which produce an oily/waxy substance, called sebum, to lubricate (oil) the skin and hair. In people, these glands are found in greatest amounts on the face and scalp, joined near the top inside hair follicles or sweat pores. However, they are in all skin areas except the palms and soles (undersides) of the feet.

There are different kinds of these glands and sebum. In the eyelids, meibomian sebaceous glands emit a special kind of sebum into tears. There are several related medical conditions, including: acne, sebaceous cysts, hyperplasia, sebaceous adenoma and sebaceous gland carcinoma (see section below: Diseases).

Washing skin or hair with plain detergent can cut the amount of sebum in oily skin. Also, water temperature over 84 can keep sebum melted during a wash.

[[Microorganism]]

CATEGORIES: Microbiology, Protista, Prokaryotes

A micro-organism or microbe is an organism which is microscopic, which means so small that people cannot see them with naked eye. The study of microorganisms is called microbiology. 

Micro-organisms include bacteria, fungi, archaea, protists and viruses, and are among the earliest known life forms. The first of these four types of micro-organisms may either be free-living or parasitic. Viruses can only be parasitic, since they always reproduce inside other living things. 

Most micro-organisms are unicellular organism with only one cell, but there are unicellular protists that are visible to the human eye, and some multicellular species are microscopic.

Micro-organisms live almost everywhere on earth where there is liquid water, including hot springs on the ocean floor and deep inside rocks within the earth's crust. Such habitats are lived in by extremophiles.

Micro-organisms are critical to nutrient recycling in ecosystems, because they act as decomposers.  Because some micro-organisms can also take nitrogen out of the air, they are an important part of the nitrogen cycle. Pathogenic, or harmful, microbes can invade other organisms and cause disease.

[[Amoeba]]

CATEGORIES: Protozoa

Amoeba (plural = amoebae) is a well known genus of unicellular organism, a protist. One of its most common species, the Amoeba Proteus, is about 0.2 to 0.3 mm large. The amoeba was first discovered by August Von Rosenhof in 1757.  It is a genus of protozoa that moves with false feet, called pseudopodia.

The amoeba is a member of a whole group of amoeboid eukaryotic protists called Amoebozoa. They are heterotrophs, eating bacteria and other protists.

The pseudopodia (false feet) are extensions of the organism's cell membrane. They are used by the amoeba for phagocytosis (active food/nutrient intake) and motility (self-propelled movement).

[[Laboratory]]

CATEGORIES: Laboratory equipment

A laboratory (lab for short) is a work place where scientific research, experiments, or measurement are done. 

The word laboratory is also used for other places where the work done or equipment used are like those in scientific laboratories. These include:

Scientific laboratories can be found in schools and universities, in hospitals, in industry, in government or military facilities, and even aboard ships and spacecraft. 

[[Last Of The Conquerors]]

CATEGORIES: 1948 books

Last of the Conquerors is a 1948 novel by African-American novelist William Gardner Smith. It concerns African-American GI's serving in United States occupied Germany after World War II. The protagonist, Hayes Dawkins, has an affair with Ilse, a white German woman. He and Ilse fight against racist Army officers and policies to sustain a relationship that some white soldiers condemn (although there are also many friendly whites who help them).

Last of the Conquerors shows post-Nazi Germany as more racially tolerant than the United States. While this  may or may not be correct, Smith's novel gives an opinion of the Marshall Plan claiming that American society should be a model for the world, while African-Americans continued to deal with racism.

New, well-preserved finds such as Alxasaurus in 1993 and Beipiaosaurus in 1996 provided details about the bird-like pelvis, feet and skulls of primitive members. This helped confirm they belonged to the same group of theropod dinosaurs as Therizinosaurus and that therizinosaurs were, more specifically, advanced, herbivorous maniraptoran theropods.

Their fossils were first found in the late 1940s in Asia. They were named in 1954 after more bones were found. It was a thought to be a carnivore and herbivore; it had very long claws - they were about 3 ft long.

Spencer Perceval (1 November 1762 – 11 May 1812) was a British statesman and Prime Minister. He is the only British Prime Minister to have been assassinated.

Perceval was the seventh son of John Perceval, 2nd Earl of Egmont by his second wife. His father, a close friend of Frederick, Prince of Wales and King George III, had served in the Cabinet as First Lord of the Admiralty. 

Perceval was Prime Minister when William Wilberforce passed his Bill (law) ending the slave trade. 

The Orders in Council against trade which Perceval had written in 1807 became unpopular. In the winter of 1811 the Luddite riots started. They were also a cause of the War of 1812 with the United States of America. Perceval was forced to have an inquiry by the House of Commons. 

On 11 May 1812, Perceval was on his way to attend the inquiry. In the lobby of the House of Commons he was shot through the heart by John Bellingham. Perceval's body lay in 10 Downing Street for five days before burial. Bellingham gave himself up immediately. Tried for murder, he was found guilty and hanged a week later. 

Bellingham had a grievance, but it was not political. Bellingham petitioned the United Kingdom government for compensation over his imprisonment in Russia. This had been caused by his employer, but Bellingham blamed the British government for not getting him compensation.

Perceval was an Anglican and considered Anglicanism to be essential to the security of the state. He opposed Catholic emancipation. He is buried at St Luke's Church in Charlton, south-east London.

[[Modulation (music)]]

CATEGORIES: Music theory

Modulation, in music, means that the music changes key.   A piece of music might, for example, be "in the key of C major" (meaning that it uses the notes of a C major scale, and the C sounds like the "home key" or "tonic" as it is called in music theory).  Then it could modulate to G major so that the G now feels like the home key and the notes of a G major scale are used (the Fs will be F sharps).

Modulations like the one above are very common, because G is closely related to C (it is the 5th note in a C major scale: the "dominant").  A modulation to the subdominant (4th note of the scale) is also common (e.g. from C major to Fmajor).  Music often modulates to the relative minor (e.g. C major to A minor).

A modulation that goes to a key whose tonic is not part of the original key is called a "chromatic modulation".  Modulating from C major to A flat major would be a chromatic modulation because A flat is not a note in the C major scale.

Most pieces of music will modulate, especially if they are long pieces.  It gives the music variety and helps to give it shape:  the farther away from the tonic it goes the more tension there is.  When the music eventually returns to the original key it feels like a homecoming. 

[[Member of parliament]]

CATEGORIES: British politicians, Parliaments

A member of parliament (usually shortened to MP) is a person in the United Kingdom or in Canada who represents the people of an area (called a "constituency") in the House of Commons.

In the UK, the main political parties are:

In Canada, the main political parties are:

Members of provincial legislatures in Canada are sometimes referred to as member of provincial parliament (MPP) and other times member of legislative assembly (MLA).

[[Relative key]]

CATEGORIES: Music theory

When a piece of music is in a major key, the relative minor means the minor key which has the same key signature. It can be found by taking the sixth note of the first scale and playing a minor scale starting on that note. For example: in C major the sixth note is an A. Therefore, A minor is the relative minor of C major (C major and A minor share the same key signature: no sharps or flats).

C major is called the relative major of A minor.

A complete list of relative minor/major pairs in order of the circle of fifths is:

CATEGORIES: 1984 movies, American crime drama movies, Italian drama movies, English-language movies, Movies directed by Sergio Leone

Once Upon a Time in America is a 1984 movie directed by Sergio Leone and starring Robert De Niro and James Woods as Jewish gangsters. The movie was Sergio Leone's last before his death.

The movie is set at three different times; 

When Leone finished making the movie it was 229 minutes (3 hours and 49 minutes) and started with an old character (Robert De Niro) remembering his past; it then showed him as a child and as a young adult. We call this flashbacks; it can happen in movie but certainly not in real life. But when it was first shown to American audiences it was made much shorter and set in chronological order; meaning the movie first showed the characters as children, then as young adults and then as older adults; or 'from start to finish'. We call this chronological; this is what would happen in real life. Many people agree that the longer version is much better than the shortened chronological version.

[[Abstract algebra]]

CATEGORIES: Algebra

Abstract algebra is a part of math which studies algebraic structures. These include:

It is normal to build a theory on one kind of structure, like group theory or category theory. 

The purpose of the theory of each concept is to organize the precise definition of the concept, examples of it, its substructures, the ways to relate different examples of the concept algebraically (these are called morphisms in some cases), and the concept's applications, both inside its own theory and outside in other areas of mathematics.

During history, different fields of mathematics have used algebras. Algebras are about finding or specifying rules on how to calculate with certain mathematical formulas and expressions. Another algebra (which is not abstract) is elementary algebra, for example. 

[[Geodesic]]

CATEGORIES: Geometry

In mathematics a geodesic is a curve with the shortest length between two places on a surface when considering places which are not too far.  These paths on a sphere are also called great circles, such that in this case, two points are joined by two distinct geodesics. A minimal geodesic (or segment) is a particular case where the geodesic joining two distant points has the shortest length.

[[Anarcho-syndicalism]]

CATEGORIES: Anarchism

Anarcho-syndicalism is a form of anarchism. It sees labour unions as something which will cause revolutionary change. This change will give freedom and equality to the workers. Anarcho-syndicalists want to get rid of the wage system and capitalism. They believe this leads to class divisions and inequality. 

The basic concepts of anarcho-syndicalism are:

Anarcho-syndicalists believe that only direct action can bring about change. Anarcho-syndicalists do not take part in indirect action, like electing a representative to a government position.

Anarcho-syndicalism played an important role in the Spanish Civil War.

[[Trotskyism]]

CATEGORIES: Communism, Marxism

Trotskyism is the form of communism that is based on the ideas of Leon Trotsky. Trotsky described himself as an "orthodox Marxist". This is a different way of seeing the ideas of Karl Marx than the way other communists like Mao Zedong and Joseph Stalin saw them. The biggest difference is in Trotsky's idea that there needs to be an international "permanent revolution". A permanent revolution is the idea that proletarian revolution needed to spread in countries worldwide, even where capitalism was not as advanced as only the proletarian revolution could carry out the tasks of the unfinished bourgeois revolutions in these countries. This is different to the Stalinist idea of trying to preserve a single nation's revolution from within. Trotsky also supported a less authoritarian government and more democracy.

The largest Trotskyist organizations today are the  Reunified Fourth International, International Socialist Tendency, the International Communist League, and the  Committee for a Workers' International.

CATEGORIES: South Korean criminals, Presidents of South Korea, 1932 births, Living people

Roh Tae-woo (born December 4, 1932 in Daegu), is the sixth President of South Korea (1988–1993). He was a former Korean general and politician. A member of the Hanahoi, Roh was the hand-picked successor of the ex-general and president Chun Doo-hwan. This caused large pro-democracy rallies in Seoul and other cities in 1987.  Roh agreed to hold democratic presidential elections, making himself a candidate for the next election. The opposition split the votes between Kim Young-sam and Kim Dae-jung (both of whom later became presidents). This made Roh the first elected president after the time that the military ruled the country.

Roh's rule was notable for hosting the Seoul Olympics in 1988 and for his foreign policy of nordpolitik.

In 1993, Roh's successor Kim Young-sam led an anti-corruption campaign that saw Roh and Chun Doo-hwan on trial for bribery. The two former presidents were later charged with mutiny and treason for their part in the 1979 coup and the 1980 Gwangju Riot. 

Both were found to be guilty in August 1996 of treason, mutiny and corruption. Chun was sentenced to death, later changed to life imprisonment. Roh's 22 1/2-year jail sentence was reduced to 17 years. Both were released from prison in early 1998, pardoned by then-President Kim Dae-jung.

Choi Kyu-hah (July 16, 1919 – October 22, 2006) (also spelled Choi Kyu-ha) was the President of South Korea between 1979 and 1980. He was born in the town of Wonju, in Gangwon Province. He was foreign minister of South Korea from 1967 to 1971 and prime minister from 1975 to 1979. 

After the assassination of Park Chung Hee in 1979, Choi, the prime minister of South Korea at the time, took power. Because of the unrest of Park's authoritarian rule, Choi promised a new constitution and democratic elections (many thought that the elections led by Park were flawed). He won a December election later that year to become the country's fourth president.

In December 1979, Major General Chun Doo-hwan and close allies in the military staged a military coup against Choi's government. They quickly removed the army chief of staff and by early 1980 virtually controlled the government.

In April 1980, because of increasing pressure from Chun and other politicians, Choi appointed Chun as head of the Korean Central Intelligence Agency, giving him enormous power.  In May, Chun declared martial law and removed all trappings of civilian government, becoming the de facto ruler of the country.  By then, student protests were increasing in Seoul and Gwangju. The protests in Gwangju continued, resulting in the Gwangju Massacre, where over 200 civilians were killed within five days by Chun's military.

Choi resigned soon afterward. Chun became president on September 1, 1980. After his resignation, Choi lived quietly out of the public eye. He died on October 22, 2006, aged 87.

He then served as president of the Red Cross Society, before being elected to the National Assembly in 1954. A year later, he founded the opposition Democratic Party along with several others.

After Rhee's government was ousted by a student-led pro-democracy uprising, Yun was elected president on August 13, 1960. He was merely a figurehead, as South Korea had switched to a parliamentary system in response to the authoritarian excesses of Rhee's regime.  After Park Chung Hee's coup in 1961, he stayed on briefly to provide legitimacy to the regime, but resigned on March 22, 1962. He opposed Park's authoritarian rule and ran for president twice in 1963 and 1967, losing each time. After receiving suspended sentences several times for anti-government activities, Yun retired from politics in 1980 and focused primarily on cultural activities until his death from diabetes and high blood pressure. He died in 1990.

[[Canonization]]

CATEGORIES: Christian terminology, Christian saints

Canonisation is a statement by a church saying that someone is a saint. This process is used by some Christian churches, most commonly in the Roman Catholic Church. The person must be dead, because living people cannot be canonised.

The process of canonisation involves proving that the person lived in a way that justifies this decision. They must have loved others and loved God. In the Catholic Church, at least two miracles by the saint's intercession must be proven. This means that, because the person is believed to be in heaven, someone must pray, or ask, for the saint to pray for them in heaven. If the prayer is answered and a miracle happens, then they know that the person is a saint. The miracles prove that the saint must be in heaven with God, and able to ask God for prayers to be answered.            

These people then enter into the canon, or list, of saints.

It is not correct to say that the Church "makes" someone a saint. The Catholic Church believes that anyone who is in heaven is already a saint. The canonisation process just finds out for sure, or without a doubt, that someone is a saint.

[[Lord]]

CATEGORIES: Royalty and nobility, Religious terminology

A Lord (Laird in some Scottish contexts) is a person who has power and authority. Women will usually (but not universally) take the title 'Lady' instead of Laird or Lord, but there is an example of a female Lord: Lord of Mann, the ruler of the Isle of Man. The territory belonging to a lord is often called a lordship. Lords as a group are a peerage. 

The word actually comes from the Old English forms for "loaf" (bread) and "ward" (used to mean "protector", although today it means "one who is protected"). So a lord or "loaf ward" was originally "the one who protected the loaf". A mesne lord was a lord in the feudal system who had vassals who held land from him, but who was himself the vassal of a higher lord. The one who ruled over mesne lords was sometimes called an overlord. This higher lord was sometimes the king.

In a religious context, The Lord means God, mainly by the Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Islam, and Christianity).

[[Interval (music)]]

CATEGORIES: Music theory

An interval in music means the distance between two notes (whether these notes are played together or separately).

Two notes on a keyboard which are next to one another (counting both white and black notes) are a “semitone” apart. A “tone” is two semitones (see semitone). However, an “intervale” depends on how the notes are written (what they are called) e.g. whether the black note between D and E is written as D sharp or E flat (which are two different names for the same note).

Please note that in all of the examples below, C is the lower note of the pair, and the other note is the next note of that name above it. So, the interval between a C and a B is only a major 7th if it is between a C and next B above it.

[[Musical mode]]

CATEGORIES: Music theory

Modes in music are a kind of scale.

The Ancient Greeks used several modes in their music. Medieval musicians borrowed the names of these modes to describe the scales used in their music. Western music predominantly usually uses two scales: major and minor, which correspond to the Ionian and Aeolian modes. Like any other scale, a mode can start on any note.

Each mode has a different pattern of tones and semitones (or “half tones”) (see semitone).

tone, tone, semitone, tone, tone, tone, semitone.

tone, semitone, tone, tone, semitone, tone, tone.

The modes are easiest to see on a piano keyboard using the white notes only. The most common modern modes are:

It will be seen that

Each mode also has a version called “hypo—“.

For example: A to A is Hypodorian. It is the same as Aeolian, but the D is treated as the “keynote”.

The names of the modes come from cities in Ancient Greece.

In the Middle Ages these modes were widely used in church music.

Some composers in recent centuries have enjoyed using the ancient modes from time to time in their music. Folksongs are often modal. Greensleeves is an example of a well-known tune which is modal.

CATEGORIES: Fortification

Fortifications are military constructions and buildings designed for defense during war. People have constructed defensive works for many thousands of years, but the designs have become more and more complex. The term fortification comes from the Latin words fortis ("strong") and facere ("to make").

Many military installations are known as forts, although they are not always fortified. Larger forts may class as fortresses, smaller ones formerly often bore the name of fortalices. Some are castles. The word fortification can also mean the practice of improving an area's defense with defensive works. City walls are fortifications but not necessarily called fortresses.

The last great system of fortification to be built was the Atlantic Wall.

Hadrian's Wall (Vallum Aelium or none) is a stone and turf fortification built across northern Great Britain by the Roman Empire in the early second century. The Roman emperor Hadrian built the wall to control barbarians: the ancient Britons to the north of the wall. The wall is now in England, and runs between the Solway Firth and the River Tyne in northern England. When the Romans built the wall, it was the northern border of the Roman Empire. 

The Roman legions (armies) of the governor of Roman Britain, Platorius Nepos, built the wall for the emperor between 122 and 126. The wall was about 118 long. Most of the wall – 67 – was made of stone. To the west of this section – for 46 – the wall was made of turf. The stone part of the wall was 3 thick and about 4.2 tall. The wall's turf part was 6 thick and about 4.2 tall. To start with, the wall's east end was at Newcastle upon Tyne (Pons Aelius), but later the Romans built more stone wall for 6 to the east, to Wallsend on Tyne. In front of the wall (on the northern side) was a ditch. The ditch was 6 away from the wall. The ditch was at about 3 deep and was normally about 8.2 wide. The Romans used the wall for at least two hundred years.

Hadrian's Wall is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site called Frontiers of the Roman Empire. It was made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987. It shares this listing with the Antonine Wall in Scotland and the German fortifications known as the Limes Germanicus. Hadrian's Wall was the first of two "great walls" created by the Romans in Great Britain. Its ruins are more visible than the lesser known Antonine Wall to the north.

The Vallum is a huge earthwork associated with Hadrian's Wall. It runs from coast to coast to the south of the wall.

The third part of the definition was not always used by classical economists. The classical economist David Ricardo would use the above definition for the term fixed capital while including raw materials and intermediate products are part of world life in which they can easily spend their life.

[[Felix Klein]]

CATEGORIES: German mathematicians, 1849 births, 1925 deaths

Felix Christian Klein (April 25, 1849, Düsseldorf, (then) Prussian Empire – June 22, 1925, Göttingen, Germany) was a German mathematician. He became known for his work in group theory, function theory, non-Euclidean geometry, and on the connections between geometry and group theory. His 1872 Erlangen Program, which ate geometries by their underlying symmetry groups, was a hugely influential synthesis of much of the mathematics of the day.

The Klein bottle is named after him.

[[Land (economics)]]

CATEGORIES: Factors of production

In economics, land means all natural resources that cannot be produced in a larger quantity if prices go up, such as geographical locations and mineral deposits. 

In classical economics it is considered one of three factors of production, the other two being capital and labor; income that one gets because of ownership or control of natural resources is often referred to as rent.

[[Part (music)]]

CATEGORIES: Musical terminology

In music, a part is a line of music which is played by one player or group of players (or sung by one or more singers).  This is the usual meaning of the word “part” when talking about musical compositions.  

When a group of instruments are all playing the same notes together - like the first violins in an orchestra, they are all playing the same part.  The second violins are playing another part, the violas are playing yet another part, etc.

In a string quartet each of the four instruments plays a different part.

A group of singers who are all singing the tune together are singing in unison.  If they divide into soprano, alto, tenor and bass, they are singing in four parts.  The sopranos may be singing the tune and the altos, tenors and basses are providing the harmony underneath.  This is called “4 part harmony”.  If each of the four parts has its own share of the melody (or its own melody) it is polyphonic music.  Polyphonic music is always in several parts.

Sometimes music for the piano or organ may be written in a strict number of parts, e.g. a 5 part fugue for the piano could also be performed on five different instruments because there are always exactly five different lines of music (although sometimes a part will have a rest, but this is always shown by rests in the music).  Although written on two staves for the pianist (or three staves for an organist) it could be written on five staves: one stave for each part.

Another word for a musical part is voice.  In most other European languages the word for part in this musical sense is the same as the normal word for  voice e.g. in German: Stimme or French voix.

In general, the more parts there are in a musical composition the harder it is to compose because they all have to fit together to sound nice.  The 16th century composer Thomas Tallis wrote a motet called Spem in alium which is in 40 parts.  A choir of at least 40 people is needed to sing it, and even then each person will be singing something different to all the others.

[[Theory of computation]]

CATEGORIES: Mathematics, Computer science

The theory of computation is a branch of mathematics. Generally it is seen as belonging to computer science. The field of study of this subject is to see if a certain problem can be solved by a computer. If this is the case, then the question is to know if it can be solved in an efficient way. 

There are two major branches in it. The first is computability theory. It looks to see if a certain problem can be solved by a computer. Since this is a theoretical field of study, no real computers are used. They are replaced by a system called the Turing machine.

Once it is known if such a solution exists, computer scientists want to know if it can be found, and perhaps how it can be improved. This field of study is covered by the complexity theory. That theory has developed concepts to compare different methods of solving a problem to one another. Such methods are usually called algorithms. This is similar to comparing cooking recipes and seeing which of two recipes is easier to do.

A link, also called a Gunter’s link, was a unit of length in the imperial and US customary systems. Links were commonly used in measuring land in the English-speaking world before the twentieth century, but are never used. Link is abbreviated as ln. It was invented by Edmund Gunter, a professor of astronomy at Gresham College, London, the same man who made the chain. He made the link as a low-technology piece of equipment that could survey small areas of land very accurately, whereas the chain could measure towns and large areas of land.

[[Rod (unit)]]

CATEGORIES: Imperial units, Units of length

A rod, a perchArea or a pole is a unit of length in the imperial and US systems.

In medieval times English ploughmen used a wooden stick with a pointed tip to spur or guide their oxen.  The rod was the length of this stick.  In use from the 6th century, its modern value was standardized in the 12th century with Composito Ulnarum et Perticarum.

The rod is still in use as a unit of measure in certain specialised fields.  In recreational canoeing, overland paths where canoes must be carried are measured in rods. This is probably because the length of a typical canoe is about one rod.

[[Chain (unit)]]

Stefan Zweig (tsvaɪk; November 28, 1881 – February 22, 1942) was an Austrian writer of Jewish descent. He was born in Vienna. He volunteered to be a soldier in the First World War, and got the post as a military commentator. This made him an enemy of war. The Nazis gained power in Germany in 1933, and their influence could be felt in Austria as well. 1934, Stefan Zweig emigrated, first to London, then to South America. That way he lost much of his audience. He committed suicide (together with his second wife) by barbiturate overdose in Petropolis, Rio de Janeiro in 1942.

He has written many books and poems. One of his best-known works is called 'Schachnovelle (The Royal Game, in English.

[[Complexity theory]]

CATEGORIES: Computer science

Complexity theory is a type of Computer science. It looks at how hard a problem is to do for a computer, and how good particular solutions (algorithms)  to that problem are. Different algorithms that solve a problem may be better or worse in multiple ways. An algorithm may be faster than some other algorithm, but it may need more resources, like memory.

Part of complexity theory is understanding how algorithms perform in their worst-case scenario. An algorithm's worst-case scenario is a problem that will take a long time, or lots of resources, to solve. If people know how good an algorithm is in its worst case, they can guarantee that the algorithm will be at least that good in every case. People are also interested in how a certain algorithm does on average; many algorithms are very inefficient in their worst case, but are okay on most cases. Knowing how good an algorithm is on average lets people know what to generally expect when using that algorithm.

[[Binary operation]]

CATEGORIES: Mathematics

In mathematics, a binary operation, often denoted *, on a set is a way of combining a pair of elements in that set that results in another element of the set. For example, if we take a pair of natural numbers and let the operation * be addition, then their sum is also a natural number, and is the result of applying this particular binary operation. Another example of an operation on the natural numbers is multiplication. For instance, take the natural numbers 2 and 3. When multiplied together they give 6, another natural number.

Others: The sum between matrices. The composition of functions. The union and the intersection of sets are also two different binary operations on the set of all sets, or on subsets in a power set.

[[Dissociative identity disorder]]

CATEGORIES: Mental illnesses, Psychology, NPOV disputes

Dissociative identity disorder (DID), is a mental disorder. 

It was called multiple personality disorder (MPD). It is listed in the mental health diagnosis manual DSM IV.  

This is one of the most controversial mental disorders because people disagree about what causes it. The main symptoms of DID are a person showing two or more "identities" or "personality states". The person behaves differently depending which identity is in control.  The second important symptom is when a person forgets important, personal things which people normally do not forget.  

A person is not diagnosed with DID if the symptoms are caused by drugs, illness or (with children) pretending to play with imaginary friends.  Doctors must also rule out pretending to have DID for attention or sympathy, and malingering (pretending to have DID for some personal gain).  Most patients with DID are also diagnosed with other mental disorders.

[[Employee]]

CATEGORIES: Employment, Social sciences

An employee is a term for workers and managers working for a company, organization or community.  These people are the staff of the organization.  In general, any person hired by an employer to do a particular job in exchange for payment is an employee, but there are different kinds of employees.  In some countries, employers are required by law to do certain things, like obey minimum wage laws, provide a safe workplace, and sometimes pay a tax.  Employers also have to give their official employees benefits, like paying for health insurance.  Because of this, some employers like to hire independent contractors to do work instead of regular employees.  In the United States, a worker is an employee if their employer gets to tell them what do do, how to do it, and when to do it in a material way and an independent contractor if they get to make their own decisions about how to do what the employer wants.

The relationship between employer and employee is different from that between the firm and a customer or client.

An employee usually has to provide a resume and have an interview before being offered a job. 

[[Employer]]

CATEGORIES: Employment, Social sciences

An employer is a person or institution that hires employees.  Employers offer wages or a salary to the workers in exchange for the worker's work or labor.

One speaks of wages if the employee is paid by the hour and of salary if he is paid a set rate per pay period. Wages are paid for all hours worked, including overtime, but a salary is typically not paid more for more hours worked than the minimum.

Employers include everything from individuals hiring a babysitter to governments and businesses which may hire many thousands of employees.  In most western societies governments are the largest single employers, but most of the work force is employed in small and medium businesses in the private sector.

In 1946, Conférence Générale des Poids et Mesures (CGPM) set the unit of force in the MKS system of units to be the amount needed to accelerate 1 kilogram of mass at the rate of 1 metre per second each second.  In 1948, the CGPM adopted the name "newton" for this force.  The MKS system then became the blueprint for today's SI International System of Units.  That made the newton the standard unit of force.

This SI unit is named after Isaac Newton. As with every International System of Units (SI) unit named for a person, the first letter of its symbol is upper case (N). However, when an SI unit is spelled out in English, it should always begin with a lower case letter (newton)—except in a situation where any word in that position would be capitalized, such as at the beginning of a sentence or in material using title case. Note that "degree Celsius" conforms to this rule because the "d" is lowercase.— Based on The International System of Units, section 5.2.

Newton's second law of motion states that F = ma, where F is the force applied, m is the mass of the object receiving the force, and a is the acceleration of the object. The newton is therefore:2

[[Corporation]]

CATEGORIES: Companies

A corporation is a union of natural persons that has its own legal status. This status is independent from the persons involved. 

Because it is recognized by governments as a separate entity, the corporation must file tax returns and pay taxes and conform to state and federal law. This separation of persons and corporation gives it special powers. A corporation's status and capacity is determined by the law of the place of incorporation.

Investors and entrepreneurs often form joint stock companies. Therefore, the term corporation often means such business corporations. Corporations may also be formed for local government (municipal corporation), political, religious, and charitable purposes (not-for-profit corporation), or government programs (government-owned corporation).  Condominiums are a common kind of non-profit corporation.

In common speech, the word "corporation" refers usually to limited responsibility corporation. That is a business firm where each of the partners invest a sum of money in as the capital of the corporation. They receive shares for the sum they have invested. If the company becomes bankrupt, the business partners are responsible for only the name value of their shares of the company's debts. The partners do not use their personal money to pay for the debt.

[[Natural person]]

CATEGORIES: Law

In jurisprudence, a natural person is a real human being in contrast to an artificial person, meaning an organization that the law treats for some purposes as if it were a person distinct from its members or owner.

For example, the right to vote is given to natural persons only. That is the case for most of the human rights. Therefore, obviously a corporation cannot hold public office, but it can file a lawsuit.

Although science fiction has long fantasized about the possibility of sentient robots (e.g. androids) living among humans (such as Robin Williams Bicentennial Man), no court has yet dealt with the question of whether such a being would be considered a natural person.

[[Jurisprudence]]

CATEGORIES: Law

Jurisprudence is the theory and philosophy of law. Scholars of jurisprudence, or legal philosophers, hope to obtain a deeper understanding of the nature of law, of legal reasoning, legal systems and of legal institutions. As jurisprudence has developed, there are three main aspects with which scholarly writing engages:

Modern jurisprudence and philosophy of law is dominated today primarily by Western academics. The ideas of the Western legal tradition have become so pervasive throughout the world that it is tempting to see them as universal. Historically, however, many philosophers from other traditions have discussed the same questions, from Islamic scholars to the ancient Greeks.

[[Legal entity]]

CATEGORIES: Law

A legal entity is a legal construct through which the law allows a group of natural persons to act as if they were a single person for certain purposes.  The most common purposes are lawsuits, property ownership, and contracts.

A legal entity is not always something else than the natural persons of which it is composed as one can see with a company or corporation.

Some examples of legal entities include:

[[Ownership]]

CATEGORIES: Property

Ownership means total possession or control of property, which may be a business, an object, land or real estate, intellectual property or some other kind of property.

The rights of ownership are: 

Ownership can be divided, or shared between owners. Ownership has no legal value until money is added into the situation. The surplus, or profits, or money value of what is owned is divided according to the ownership accounts.

Ownership is needed for the development of the capitalist socio-economic system. The concept of ownership has existed for thousands of years and in all cultures.

[[Possession]]

CATEGORIES: Law, Religious behavior and experience

Possession usually means to have some sort of ownership over something else. A person may be in possession of some property, which is legal ownership, under property law.

There are some other related uses of the term. When English explorer, Captain James Cook, claimed the country of Australia as a British country, he took "possession" of the land. The spot where he made his claim on 22 August 1770, a small island in the Torres Strait, is now called Possession Island.

In some beliefs, to be possessed is to be under the control of devils, demons, or evil spirits. These people may do evil or terrible things because of their possession.

[[Officer of arms]]

CATEGORIES: Politics

An officer of arms is someone who is chosen by a sovereign or state to do some important jobs relating to:

In Scotland the officers of arms maintain the old job of a herald - passing on royal messages. Three days after parliament is dissolved in London the royal proclamation is read out at the Mercat Cross in Edinburgh. They wait three days because this is how long it used to take to get from London to Edinburgh by horse.

[[Personal property]]

CATEGORIES: Property

Personal property means property that consists of object that can be moved from one place to another. 

In the common law systems personal property may also be called chattels. There it is distinguished from real property, or real estate. 

In the civil law systems personal property is often called movable property or movables - any property that can be moved from one location to another. This term is in distinction with immovable property or immovables, such as land and buildings.

A machinery, which can be dismantled and moved to a new place, which is installed in a building falls into which category.

[[Statutory law]]

CATEGORIES: Types of law

Statutory law is written law (as opposed to oral or customary law) set down by a legislature or other governing authority such as the executive branch of government in response to a need to clarify the functioning of government, improve civil order, answer a public need, to codify existing law, or for an individual or company to obtain special treatment.

The term codified law is sometimes used as a synonym for statutory law in general. In some U.S. states, the entire body of statutory law is referred to as a "code," such as the Ohio Revised Code. At the federal and state level in the United States, portions of the statutory law are also referred to as "code," such as the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

[[Oral law]]

CATEGORIES: Types of law, Oral tradition

An oral law are rules of human behavior in use in a given culture, religion or other group, which is transmitted by oral tradition and respected. Oral law is spoken, as opposed to statutory law, which is written down. Like customary law, oral laws depend not on legislation passed by a government, but rather tradition, custom and precedent.

Many cultures do have an oral law, while most legal systems of today have a formal written organisation.

[[Oral tradition]]

CATEGORIES: Oral tradition

An oral tradition or oral culture is a way of transmitting history, literature or law from one generation to the next, without a writing system, by voice. People tell stories. Often the stories are made into poems and songs to make remembering easy. For example, the Homeric poetry of the Iliad and the Odyssey combined oral literature and oral history. Eventually they were written down.

[[Royal Canadian Air Cadets]]

CATEGORIES: Canadian people

The Royal Canadian Air Cadets is a program for Canadian youth. It is supported by sponsors in the community and Canada's Canadian Armed Forces funded by the Department of National Defence. There are about 450 Air Cadet squadrons, located in every province and territory in Canada. The two other cadet programs for youth in Canada are the Royal Canadian Sea Cadets and the Royal Canadian Army Cadets.

People between the ages of 12 and 18 inclusive can join this program for free, and they are led by the officers of the Canadian Forces Cadet Instructor Cadre.

[[Legal case]]

CATEGORIES: Law

A legal case is a dispute between two parties that is resolved by a court or other legal process. A legal case may be either civil or criminal. The decision of a court is usually published in one form or another for later reference. In countries like the United States which have a common law system, decisions by a higher court are binding on lower courts when the facts and issues are similar. Stare decisis, or the concept of precedent, means to follow cases that were decided earlier when judging the current case. 

[[Nasal hair]]

CATEGORIES: Hair, Anatomy of the respiratory system

Nasal hair  are small hair-like cells in the nose. Most of them can be found near the nostrils. The purpose of these hairs is to act as a filter, keeping dust and dirt out of the nasal passages. They also draw liquid mucus up from the epithelium by capillary action. In that way, they help to maintain humidity in the air passages and stop them from drying out. The hairs trap moisture as air is breathed out. The evaporation of trapped moisture on the hairs increases the humidity of air as it is breathed in. Note that nasal hair is different from the cilia found in the nose, which are part of the olfactory system.

Some cultures consider nose hair coming out from the nostrils to be ugly. The increased growth of nasal cilia with age (particularly for men) is often a source of anxiety and embarrassment. A number of devices have been sold to trim the nose hair, including small rotary clippers and attachments for electric shavers. However, given the role of nasal cilia, many doctors recommend trimming them lightly, if at all. There is evidence that the movement in the ciliar slows down with age. This may be the reason that old people have more respiratory infections.

[[Willis Tower]]

CATEGORIES: 1973 establishments in Illinois, Buildings and structures completed in the 20th century, Skyscrapers in Chicago

The Willis Tower, formerly known as the Sears Tower, is a 108-story, 442.1 skyscraper in Chicago, Illinois. The tower has 108 stories, though the building's owners count the main roof as 109 and the mechanical penthouse roof as 110. When it finished costruction in 1973, it beat the World Trade Center in New York City to become the tallest building in the world. It was the tallest building in the world for twenty-five years until the Petronas Towers were built in Malaysia. It was also the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere for 41 years, until the new One World Trade Center beat it in 2013.

Willis Tower is seen as the best work of architect Fazlur Khan. As of 2021, it is the third-tallest building in the United States and the Western hemisphere. It is also the 23rd-tallest in the world. Each year, more than one million people visit its observation deck, the highest in the United States. It is one of Chicago's most popular tourist places. The tower was renamed in 2009 after the Willis Group bought the tower.

The building's largest office partner is United Airlines, which moved its corporate headquarters from 77 West Wacker Drive in 2012. Other major company offices in the tower include Schiff Hardin and Seyfarth Shaw. Morgan Stanley moved into the tower in 2019.

It was known as the Sears Tower until 2009, as it was the headquarters of retail company Sears from its opening in 1974. Many people from Chicago still call the tower by its original name.

[[Beetle]]

CATEGORIES: Basic English 850 words, Beetles

Beetles, the order Coleoptera, are the largest group of insects. There are 350,000 different species of beetles which have been named: about 40% of all known insects. There are an estimated 800,000 to a million living species. Beetles live almost everywhere, though not in the ocean or in places that are very cold, such as Antarctica.

Beetles went through a massive adaptive radiation early in their evolutionary history. The evolution of flowering plants helped drive the diversification of beetles. Four of the six biggest families of beetles mainly eat flowering plants.

Houston Steward Chamberlain (September 9,1855 - January 9, 1927) was a writer of books. He wrote many popular scientific books, about Richard Wagner, Immanuel Kant, and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe amongst others. He was born in Portsmouth, but later emigrated to Germany. In later life he became a German citizen. He was acquainted with Hitler and died in Bayreuth. He is known for his Antisemitism. His best-known book, The Foundations of the Nineteenth Century is seen as a standard antisemitic work of the early 20th century.

[[Arthur de Gobineau]]

CATEGORIES: 1816 births, 1882 deaths, French writers

Joseph Arthur Comte de Gobineau (July 14, 1816 — October 13, 1882) was a French aristocrat. He was well educated, and wrote many things. He became famous for developing the racialist theory of the Aryan Master race in his book An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races (1853-1855).

[[Staff (music)]]

CATEGORIES: Musical notation

A staff (or stave) is the name given to the five horizontal lines on which we can write music. Musical notes can be placed either on a line (i.e. with a line going through the middle of the note head) or in a space.  There are four inside spaces as well as the two outer spaces at the top or bottom.

The higher the pitch of the note the higher it will be on the staff. Taking the white notes of a keyboard: each note (A, B, C, D etc.) is placed higher on the stave (line, space, line, space etc.).  A clef is needed to show which notes they are. There are different clefs to suit high, medium or low instruments.

This musical example shows the opening of Symphony no 5 by Beethoven.  The first three notes are on the second line (counting from the bottom).  They are Gs, because there is a treble clef at the beginning of the staff.  The fourth note is a little lower: on the bottom line, the E line (because of the flats in the key signature it is an E flat).  The next note is between the other two in pitch (an F). After the three Fs comes a D in the outside bottom space.

Sometimes composers have used staves with fewer or more than 5 lines, but the five-line staff started to become the usual one in Western music in the 13th century.

When notes are a little too high or low to put on the stave, extension lines are used.  These are called ledger lines.  

If two or more staves are being played at the same time the staves are joined on the left by a bracket which is called a brace.  Piano music, for example, is written on two staves: one for the right hand and one for the left.

Instruments that only play a rhythm (such as the cymbals), do not need a stave.  The notes can be written just on one line. The beats are crosses. It's modern notation started from the Catholic Church.

[[Colorado potato beetle]]

CATEGORIES: Chrysomelidae, Agricultural pests

The Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata, is a beetle. It is sometimes just called the Colorado beetle. It is one of the worst potato pests in the world.  

The beetle is notable for its ability to resist pesticides. Over the last 50 years it has become resistant to 52 chemical compounds used in insecticides, including cyanide. However, not every population is resistant to every chemical.

The Colorado beetle first lived in the southwest United States and northern Mexico. Now it lives in most of North America and also in Europe and Asia.

[[Opiliones]]

CATEGORIES: Arachnids

Harvestmen are eight-legged arachnids. Even though they belong to the arachnid family, harvestmen are not spiders. They are in the order Opiliones or Phalangids.

More than 6,400 species of harvestmen have been discovered, although the real number of extant species may be more than 10,000. Well-preserved fossils have been found in the 400-million year old Rhynie cherts of Scotland. The samples found look surprisingly modern. Apparently, the basic structure of the harvestmen has not changed much since then.

In some places, harvestmen are known by the name "daddy longlegs", but this name is also used for two other unrelated arthropods: the crane fly (Tipulidae) and the cellar spider (Pholcidae).

Many species are omnivores, they eat anything they can find. Most of the time this is small insects, and some plants and fungi. Some are scavengers.

Harvestmen are not dangerous to humans. None of the described species have poison glands. They are not "true" spiders even though they look like spiders in many ways.  For example, harvestmen have no venom or silk glands; spiders have these.

Daddy Longlegs could mean:

[[Shikon no Tama]]

CATEGORIES: InuYasha

The Shikon no Tama (English:The Jewel of Four Souls) is the fictional magic jewel in Rumiko Takahashi's manga and anime series InuYasha. It contains four types per soul: Aramitama (Courage), Nigimitama (Friendship), Kushimitama (Wisdom) and Sakimitama (Love). The souls can make a person powerful. Before Midoriko sacrificed herself, she joined four souls within her heart, with the demonic one making it good and pure. This created the Shikon Jewel, where Midoriko and the demon are trapped within. The battle depends to any demon who kept the jewel. If the jewel is purified, Midoriko survives. If the demon binds the jewel, it becomes defiled. Naraku defiles the jewel, while collecting all pieces. Shako (Sango's grandfather) found the impured jewel from one of the demons. When Kikyo dies, the jewel survives and Naraku plans to retrieve it. Kagome Higurashi ends up travelling to the past while keeping the jewel. After Kagome destroys the raven, the jewel is shattered into pieces. Izumo is a philosopher half–demon who made the fake jewel with small power, by copying the real one. However, Inuyasha defeats him.

[[Daddy long-legs spider]]

CATEGORIES: Spiders

The Daddy-Long-Legs Spider (Pholcus phalangioides) is a spider of the family Pholcidae. Its legs are about 5 or 6 times the length of its body.  It is often confused with the daddy long-legs, a member of the Opiliones, which are not true (real) spiders. P. phalangioides has the habit of shaking the web violently when disturbed. This is probably to blur the vision of a predator. Because it is often found on the ceilings of rooms, caves or cellars, it is also called cellar spider.  They can easily catch and eat hairy house spiders, mosquitoes, and other insects.  When food is scarce, they will prey on their own kind. Because they originally came from the tropics, these spiders do not seem to be aware of seasonal changes and breed at any time of the year. 

The female holds 20 to 30 eggs in her jaws.  Spiderlings are transparent with short legs and change their skin about 5 or 6 times as they grow.

Females have a body length of about 9mm, males are slightly smaller.

Crossopriza lyoni and Physocyclus globosis are spiders with a very similar appearance.

[[Crane fly]]

CATEGORIES: Flies

Crane flies are flies in the family Tipulidae. They are insects. Crane flies look similar to large mosquitoes but, unlike mosquitoes, crane flies do not bite people or animals. Crane flies occasionally eat nectar.

They are also known as daddy longlegs around the world. The term 'daddy-long-legs' is also given to arachnids of the order Opiliones or the family Pholcidae. The larvae of crane flies are known commonly as leatherjackets.

There are about 15,000 different species and 525 genera of crane flies. This means that the Tipulidae (crane flies) are the largest group of flies. Most crane fly species (75%) were found by Charles P. Alexander.

The adult only lives to mate and lay eggs: 10 to 15 days is all. In some species the adult does not eat at all.

[[Threat]]

CATEGORIES: Human communication, Words, Psychology

A threat is basically a declaration of intent to inflict punishment or harm or loss on another.  However, in many cases the threat is not believed, or may even be a joke.  Like other communications a threat has a context, and the context decides its meaning.

A child who says "I'll tell my dad" may learn from the reply "I'm so scared!" that the threat is an idle threat: one that is promises harm that cannot or will not actually be inflicted.

To encourage compliance, a threat to do harm may be mixed with an offer to do good, conditional upon what the recipient does. This is sometimes called a throffer.  The threat part may be implied, yet effective. 

Some countries, such as the United States, have a legal concept of true threat. A true threat is a threatening communication which can be prosecuted under the law.

A threat can describe a situation of danger: for example "a terrorist threat". Many countries have a system where the government can adjust its security by having official threat levels.

[[Firefly]]

CATEGORIES: Polyphaga, Bioluminescent animals

Fireflies are a family of beetles called the Lampyridae. These beetles are special in that most of them have bioluminescence, the ability to produce light. They are sometimes called  'lightning bugs' or 'forest stars'. There are about 2000 different species, most of which are nocturnal.

Adults use flashes of light to attract mates. Also, firefly larvae flash their lights to warn predators that they are not a tasty meal. Many predators do not like the taste of firefly larvae.

[[Phengodidae]]

CATEGORIES: Polyphaga

Phengodidae is a family of glow-worm beetles. Their larvae are also glow-worms.

The family occurs only in the New World, and has about 30 genera. Both the females and larvae are bioluminescent: they have organs that can produce light. This family is different from the fireflies (family Lampyridae).

The larvae and the females (which keep their larval form) are predators. They feed on millipedes and other animals they find in the soil and litter. Males are winged. They are attracted to lights at night. They are probably short-lived and do not feed at all. In some species, adult males can also produce light. Females have organs that produce a green or yellow light on their trunks.  Some of them (called railroad worms) also have such an organ in front, which can produce a red light.

[[Arachnocampa]]

CATEGORIES: Flies

Arachnocampa is a family of flies. They are also called Fungus gnats. They occur in Australia and New Zealand. Their larvae are glowworms.

They were called Bolitphila (mushroom-lovers) until 1924. Then people found out that their larvae use silk threads to catch prey. Their current name means spider-grub.

With the school's help, she managed to make a "doujinshi" (self-published work mostly for beginners) manga artwork, for example, Bye-Bye Road and Star of Futile Dust.

[[Debate]]

CATEGORIES: Communication, Public speaking

Debate or debating is a method of argument. Disputes and conflicts may be settled by debate. It is a larger form of argument than logical argument, because in a debate, the debaters try to influence the feelings of the audience, in order to persuade them on a topic.

The subject or issue of the debate is the question on which the participants debate. An issue or debate always has two sides or positions. Informal debates like discussion are very common, but the quality of a debate improves with knowledge and skill of its participants as debaters.

Deliberative bodies such as parliaments, legislative assemblies, and meetings of all sorts have debates. The winner of a debate may be decided by the audience's vote, by judges, or by both.

Formal debates between candidates for an elected office are common in places where leaders of countries are chosen by the people. The most well-known of these debates are between candidates for the President and Vice President of the United States, and leaders debates between leaders of parties in Parliament in countries like Great Britain and Canada.

[[Alternative]]

In natural language and in cognitive decision-making, alternative is  one of two things/(abstract or real objects)/actions which can be chosen. From a specific perspective/(point of view)/goal, alternatives are always equivalent.

In different contexts alternative (or Alternativism) may refer to :

[[Momofuku Ando]]

CATEGORIES: 1910 births, 2007 deaths, Japanese inventors, Taiwanese businesspeople, Deaths from heart failure, Recipients of the Order of the Rising Sun

Momofuku Ando, born  Wú Bǎifú (吳百福) in Taiwanese (March 5, 1910 - January 5, 2007) was the founder and chairman of Nissin Food Products Co., Ltd., and the inventor of the modern instant noodle, ramen.

Ando was born to Taiwanese parents in Kagi (currently Chiayi), Taiwan and grew up an orphan in Tainan City. In 1948, Momofuku Ando founded what was to become Nissin in Ikeda, Osaka, Japan.  It was a small family-run company at first.

On August 25, 1958, at the age of 48, and after months of trial and error experimentation, Ando announced that he had finally perfected his flash-frying method and therefore invented the instant noodle.  Called Chikin Ramen, after the original flavour, it was originally considered a luxury food item as it cost around six times that of traditional non-instant udon and soba noodles. Ando began sales of the Cup noodles on September 18, 1971. As prices dropped, ramen soon became a booming business.  An estimated 70 billion servings were sold in 2004.

In 1964, looking for a way to promote the instant noodle industry, Ando founded the Instant Food Industry Association which set guidelines for fair competition and product quality, introducing several industry standards such as the inclusion of production dates on packaging and the "fill to" line.  The Momofuku Ando Instant Ramen Museum is named after Ando.

Ando was also the chairman of the International Ramen Manufacturers’ Association. He died on January 5, 2007 of heart failure in Osaka Prefecture at the age of 96. http://www.theage.com.au/news/world/instant-noodle-inventor-dies-at-96/2007/01/06/1167777312340.htmlhttp://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/national/20070106TDY01004.htm https://web.archive.org/web/20070107040354/http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/national/20070106TDY01004.htm

[[Demon]]

CATEGORIES: Demons, Theology, Mythology

A demon or daemon is a supernatural bad,  powerful or malevolent being in many world religions. The word 'demon' has different meanings all over the world, but often there is the idea that they are spirits that lived in a place, or went with a person. The word is also used for a type of computer program that does useful things in the background of a computer, but this use is not related to the religious meaning.

The Central Bank bombing was one of the deadliest terrorist attacks of the civil war in Sri Lanka between the government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam.

The attack happened on January 31, 1996, in Colombo, the capital city of Sri Lanka. A truck with about 440 pounds (200 kg) of high explosives crashed through the main gate of the Central Bank, a seaside building which managed most of the financial business of the country. As gunmen and security guards were shooting, the suicide bomber in the truck detonated the massive bomb, which badly damaged the bank and damaged eight other buildings nearby.

The explosion killed 90 people and injured 1,400 others. Most of these were ordinary citizens or civilians working in the small shops set up near the bank. This bombing was followed by one in July on a train that killed more than 70.

Until 2006, the Central Bank bombing was the deadliest LTTE terrorist bombing.

[[Ledger line]]

CATEGORIES: Musical notation

A ledger line is a short line used in musical notation to write notes which would otherwise be too high or too low to put on any of the five lines on the staff. A short line (slightly longer than the note) is drawn parallel to the lines on the staff, and the note head is placed on that line or in the space below or above it.

Notes with at least three or four ledger lines are rarely used for composing and arranging. It is easier to change the clef or use the “8va” sign (called "ottava" sign), which means the notes should be played an octave higher or lower than it is written, depending on whether the sign is above or below the staff.

[[Clef]]

CATEGORIES: Musical notation

A clef is a sign at the beginning of a staff of music which makes it possible for the player to work out what the notes are.  The word “clef” is a French word meaning “key”.  The original Latin word is “clavis”. It is the “key” to understanding which notes should be played.

The staff (or “stave”) consists of five lines across the page.  The notes are placed on these lines and in these spaces.  The staff is only large enough to cover one and a half octaves of music (a bit more with ledger lines).  Therefore, different clefs are used for high music and for low music.

[[Tobin tax]]

CATEGORIES: Taxation

A Tobin tax is a tax on all trade of currency across borders. 

The first idea that it could be useful came from the economist James Tobin. The tax is meant to put a penalty on short-term speculation in currencies. The proposed tax rate would be low, between 0.1% to 0.25%. 

On August 15, 1971, Richard Nixon told that it would no longer be possible to change the US dollar to gold, so ended the Bretton Woods system. Tobin suggested a new system for international currency stability, and proposed that such a system include a charge on foreign-exchange transactions. Professor Tobin later received a Nobel Prize in Economics in 1981.

The idea was nearly forgotten for more than 20 years.  In 1997 Ignacio Ramonet, editor of Le Monde Diplomatique, started the debate around the Tobin tax again with an editorial titled "Disarming the markets". Ramonet proposed to create an association for the introduction of this tax, which was named ATTAC (Association for the Taxation of financial Transactions for the Aid of Citizens). The tax has then become an issue of the antiglobalization movement and a matter of discussion not only behind academic institutions but even in the streets and in parliaments around the world, such as the UK and France.

[[Speculation]]

CATEGORIES: Finance

Speculation has a special meaning when talking about money. The person who speculates is called a speculator. A speculator does not buy goods to own them, but to sell them later. The reason is that he wants to make a profit from the change in price. 

One tries to buy the goods when they are cheap and to sell them when they are expensive. There is a good chance to profit as long as the market price of a good changes often in different directions.

Speculation includes the buying, holding, selling, and short-selling of stocks, bonds, commodities, currencies, collectibles, real estate, derivatives or any valuable financial instrument. It is the opposite of buying because one wants to use them for daily life or to get income from them (as dividends or interest). 

Speculation is one of the biggest market roles in western financial markets. The others are hedging, long term investing and arbitrage.  Speculators do not plan to keep an asset for a long time.

[[Quarterback]]

CATEGORIES: Canadian football, American football positions

A quarterback (QB) is a position in American and Canadian football. Quarterbacks are members of the offense, or attacking team. They line up directly behind the center, in the middle of the offensive team's line. A quarterback is usually the leader, and starts most plays. In addition, the quarterback gives commands to the other players before the start of a play. A quarterback will in most attacking plays throw the ball to a member of their team, ready to run to the end of the pitch. Quarterbacks may also run the ball themselves, as well as hand the ball to a runningback. These players are usually the faces of their respective teams. Some very notable players at this position in history are Tom Brady, Jim Kelly, and Peyton Manning.

[[Arrest]]

CATEGORIES: Criminal justice, Punishments, Imprisonment and detention

An arrest is when a person's liberty is removed by taking them into detention (custody). This is usually done after an investigation of a crime or in stopping a crime from taking place. The term comes from Anglo-Norman. It is related to the French word arrêt, which means "stop".

Police and some other organisations are allowed to arrest people. In some places, normal people can arrest others (a "citizen's arrest"). For example, in England and Wales, a citizen's arrest can be made on someone who has committed a serious crime, though there are rules as to when and how this can be done.

[[James Tobin]]

CATEGORIES: 1918 births, 2002 deaths, American economists, American Nobel Prize winners

James Tobin (March 5, 1918 – March 11, 2002) was an American economist. Outside academia, Tobin became widely known for his suggestion of a tax on foreign exchange transactions, now known as the "Tobin tax". This was designed to reduce speculation on currency markets, which he saw as unproductive. He also suggested that the money gained from the tax could be used to fund projects for the benefit of Third World countries, or to support the United Nations.

Tobin's academic work included pioneering contributions to the study of investment, monetary and fiscal policy and financial markets. He promoted and developed the ideas of Keynesian economics. He believed that governments should intervene in the economy in order to stabilise output and avoid recessions.

[[Bretton Woods system]]

CATEGORIES: Economic systems

The Bretton Woods system was the first system used to control the value of money between different countries. It meant that each country had to have a monetary policy that kept the exchange rate of its currency within a fixed value—plus or minus one percent—in terms of gold.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) was created to fight against temporary imbalances of payments. The Bretton Woods system was the first monetary order that organized monetary relations among independent nation-states.

It set out the rules for commercial and financial relations among the world's major industrial states.

Plans to rebuild the international economic system after the end of World War II started before the war ended. 730 delegates from all 44 Allies of World War II came to Bretton Woods, New Hampshire for the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference. The delegates discussed and then signed the Bretton Woods Agreements during the first three weeks of July 1944.

The planners at Bretton Woods set up a system of rules, institutions, and procedures to regulate the international monetary system. They started the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) (now one of five institutions in the World Bank Group) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). These organizations became active in 1946 after enough countries had ratified the agreement.

Until the early 1970s, the Bretton Woods system worked. It controlled conflict and achieved the common goals of the leading states that had created it, especially the United States. But in 1971, In the face of increasing strain, the United States decided not to allow the conversion of dollars to gold and the system collapsed.

[[Antiglobalization]]

CATEGORIES: Economics, Protests

Anti-globalization is used for people and groups who oppose certain aspects of globalization in its present form.

“Anti-globalization” is considered by many to be a social movement, while others consider it to be several separate social movements. In either case, participants are united in opposition to the political power of large corporations, as exercised in trade agreements and elsewhere, which they say destroys the environment, human rights, labor rights for worker, national sovereignty, the third world, and more.  

Most people who are called "anti-globalization"  prefer instead to describe themselves as the Global Justice Movement, the Movement of Movements (a popular term in Italy), the "alter-globalization" movement (popular in France), and a number of other terms.

The groups and individuals that would come to be known as the "anti-globalization movement" developed in the late twentieth century to combat the globalization of corporate economic activity and the free trade with developing nations that might result from such activity.

[[Truth value]]

CATEGORIES: Logic

In multi-valued logics, the truth value can be other values as well. For example, one could use a value between 0 and 1 to say how much it is true. Zero would mean that it is completely false, and one would mean that it is completely true. When the car is orange (and we define orange as half red, half yellow), the truth value could be 0.5 because the statement is half true and half false. it is also used in critical thinking.

Its university is the oldest in Moravia and second oldest in the Czech Republic. The university was founded in 1573 as part of effort to reestablish Roman Catholicism in the country. Roughly nine out of ten people of the Czech Crown lands were Protestants at the time. 

[[Astronomical clock]]

CATEGORIES: Clocks, Astronomy

An astronomical clock is a clock with special mechanisms and dials to display astronomical information. It shows the relative positions of the sun, moon, zodiacal constellations, and sometimes major planets. Some examples are large public clocks, but others are instruments for use inside buildings. Astronomical watches are made by several manufacturers. They are also extremely accurate.

The clocks made in the Middle Ages used the geocentric method, showing the Earth at the centre. The Sun rotates round the Earth:  this accords with daily experience and with the world view of pre-Copernican Europe.

The idea of an astronomical clock is ancient. Although not a clock in the traditional sense, the 2nd century BC Antikythera mechanism of ancient Greece was used to calculate the positions of the sun, moon, and stars at any given point by use of complex mechanical gears. European astronomical clocks are probably descended from the technology of the Antikythera mechanism. As Cicero later wrote in the 1st century BC, Archimedes and Posidonius's orrery achieved virtually the same thing.

[[Theobroma]]

CATEGORIES: Trees, Sterculiaceae

Theobroma is a genus. There are about 20 species in it. They are small trees, native to the forests of Central and South America. The name translates to food of the gods.

Their family is given as Sterculiaceae or sometimes as Malvaceae.

Some of these trees have edible seeds.  Best known are perhaps the Cacao tree, the source of cocoa and chocolate. Other well-known trees are Cupuaçu, and Mocambo. 

Theobroma species are used as food plants by the larvae of some moths of the genus Endoclita including E. chalybeatus, E. damor, E. hosei and E. sericeus. The larva of another moth, Hypercompe muzina, feeds exclusively on Theobroma cacao.

[[Cupuaçu]]

CATEGORIES: Sterculiaceae, Trees

Cupuaçu (Theobroma grandiflorum), also spelled Cupuassu and Copoasu, is a tropical rainforest tree related to Cacao. Common throughout the Amazon basin, it is widely cultivated in the north of Brazil. The largest production occurs in  Pará, followed by Amazonas, Rondônia and Acre.

Cupuaçu trees usually are between  5 and 15 meters (16 to 50 feet) tall. Some trees can reach 20 meters (65 feet). They have brown bark. Their leaves are 25–35 cm (10–14 in) long and 6–10 cm (2–4 in) across. These leaves have 9 or 10 pairs of veins. As they mature, their leaves change colour from pink-tinted to green. Eventually they begin bearing fruit. Cupuaçu fruits are oblong, brown, and fuzzy, 20 cm (8 in) long, 1–2 kg (2–4 lb) in weight, and covered with a thick (4–7 mm), hard exocarp.

The white pulp of the cupuaçu is uniquely fragrant. It contains theacrine (1,3,7,9-tetramethyluric acid) instead of the xanthines (caffeine, theobromine, and theophylline) found in cacao. Cupuaçu can replace cocoa in many day-to-day foods, especially for children, such as chocolate milk. It is frequently used in desserts, juices and sweets. Cupuaçu seeds can be made into cupulate, which looks and tastes just like chocolate but is cheaper and more resistant to heat.April 2009 Asahi Foods, a Japanese company, once tried to patent the production and use of Cupuaçu seed fat, but they failed.

The wood is also commonly used for timber.

[[Array data structure]]

CATEGORIES: Data structures

In programming languages, an array is a way of storing several items (such as integers).

These items must have the same type (only integers, only strings, …) because an array can not store different kinds of items.

Every item in an array has a number so the programmer can get the item by using that number.

This number is called the index.

In some programming languages, the first item has index 0, the second item has index 1 and so on.

But in other languages, the first item has index 1 (and then 2, 3, …).

When the programmer creates an array, they must give the size of the array.

This is the number of items that can be stored in the array.

If the programmer wants to store more items, then they must create a new array.

This is because the size of an array can not be changed.

[[Tierce de Picardie]]

CATEGORIES: Musical terminology

In music a Tierce de Picardie (meaning Picardy third) is a major chord at the end of a piece of music in a  minor key.

In the 16th to 17th centuries this was a very common way to end a piece in a minor key. This is because music in the minor sounds melancholy or disturbed in comparison to the major because the third note of the scale is flattened (lowered by a semitone). In the harmonic series this minor third is the 7th harmonic which sounds dissonant against the fundamental (first note of the scale).  This means that ending in the major gives a sense of relief after the tension of the minor.  In a piece in A minor, for example, where the third note of the scale is C natural, in a Tierce de Picardie the final chord will include a C sharp, changing the chord from A minor to A major.

Beethoven’s "Fifth Symphony" is in C minor but the last movement is in the major.  This is not a Tierce de Picardie in this case, as the term applies only when just the last chord alters.  The term was introduced in 1767 by Rousseau in his "Dictionnaire de musique" (Dictionary of Music).  “Tierce” means “third”, but no one knows why he called it “Picardie” (Picardy is an area in the north of France).

Bach used it fairly often in his music.  The first movement of the "Concerto for Two Violins and Orchestra" is a good example.  In his "Fantasia and Fugue in G minor BWV542" the fugue ends with a Tierce de Picardie and, in some editions, the Fantasie as well.  It is possible that Bach would have finished the Fantasie with a major chord only if he was playing it on its own (without the fugue), but we cannot be sure of this.  Another good example of the Tierce de Picardie is the end of Cantata No. 82 "Ich Habe Genug", which is extremely effective. Another famous piece that ends in a Tierce de Picardie is Greensleeves.

[[Real-time strategy]]

CATEGORIES: Real-time strategy video games, Types of video games, Video game genres

Real-time strategy (RTS) is a genre of computer and video games. In real-time strategy games, every player has an army to attack the other player(s). Every player has a military base and people or vehicles (these are called units). The player also has money to create new units or to build new buildings. These buildings can allow the player to do things, such as creating units or to use new technology.

The player that destroys the base and the units of the other player(s) wins.

In real-time strategy games, everything the player does, happens right away: there's no time between doing something (like telling a unit to move) and seeing it happen. This is different in turn-based strategy where the players take turns to do things.

Pasta is a food made from starch and water. It is usually cooked in hot water before being eaten. Pasta has been very popular in Italy and has also been eaten in many parts of Asia for a long time. It is also the national dish of Italy, invented in 1986

Pasta is often noodles. It is usually eaten in sauce, fried or in soup. Pasta is usually made from either wheat flour or rice flour, but it can be made with other types of flour. Pasta sometimes has eggs in it. Pasta comes in many different shapes and sizes.

Long pasta is named noodles. it has different names for each width. the name also changes if the edge is wavy. 

Short pasta comes in many shapes, each with a different name. they are named after what they look like. one common example is "bow-ties".

In addition to Italy, Pasta is also a popular dish in Greece. In Greek cuisine  there is a pasta dish called pastitsio which is similar to lasagna.

[[Flour]]

CATEGORIES: Flour

Flour is grains that have been dried and ground into powder. It is usually made of wheat, but can also be made from many other grains, nuts and other substances. Flour is used to make many foods.

Flour is an important part of bread, pasta, cookies, cakes, tortillas. Flour is made in a flour mill where the grain is put between two stones or steel wheels which are rubbed together to make the grains into powder.

The main kinds of flour used in cooking are all-purpose flour, self-raising flour and cake flour. Self-raising flour contains a leavening agent. This makes the food rise (expand) during baking. It produces lighter and softer baked foods by creating small bubbles. Flour that does not have a leavening agent is called all-purpose flour, or plain flour.

Flour can also be made at home. Some people like to make flour at home because when flour comes from the factory, the outer shells of the grains have usually been removed. The outer shells have fiber which is needed for metabolism. Flour has many nutrients. You can even make flour out of things such as pumpkins, pumpkin seeds, brown and white rice, wheat, etc.

[[Boston Tea Party]]

CATEGORIES: 1770s in Massachusetts, 18th century rebellions, American Revolutionary War, History of Boston, Massachusetts, Rebellions in North America, 1773

The Boston Tea Party was a protest by American colonists (These people were known as patriots) against King George III's rule in America. It happened on December 16, 1773.

The Boston Tea Party was an act of protest against the British for the Tea Act, one of several new attempts to tax colonists. The Americans had no one to speak for them in the British government. They were frustrated that they were being taxed by the government but had no part in how the government was run. They did not think it was right to pay taxes when they did not have a representative in the government ("No taxation without representation!"). Also, merchants selling their goods would lose their profit because of the taxes. The Americans began purchasing smuggled goods, which were much cheaper.

To show how angry they were, the Sons of Liberty, led by Samuel Adams, dressed up as Native Americans and went onto ships in the Boston Harbor.  They took boxes of tea and dumped them into the water.  The British government was enraged about this.  Parliament made even stricter laws for the colonies, later called the Intolerable Acts.  One of the Acts closed Boston Harbor until the colonists paid for all the tea they dumped.  Another took away the right of Boston to govern itself,

The Boston Tea Party was one of the main events that started the American Revolutionary War.

David Kinnison 1764?-1852 who served briefly in the American Revolution  also claimed to have been a member of the Boston Tea Party....although he would have been only 9 years old at the time!

[[Natural capital]]

CATEGORIES: Ecology, Economics, Green politics

Natural capital is a metaphor for the mineral, plant, and animal formations of the Earth's biosphere when viewed as a means of production of oxygen, water filter, erosion preventer, or provider of other ecosystem services.  

In a traditional economic analysis of the factors of production, natural capital would usually be understood as "land" and therefore something else than "capital" in its original sense.  

At the beginning of reflection about economics "land" was seen as something natural, but "capital"  as man-made goods only.  

But the benefits which humans have from nature are many. 17 of them were closely looked at by Robert Costanza.  These benefits are in some ways similar to those that owners of "capital" have as their capital produces more goods, e.g. a factory which produces automobiles just as an apple tree produces apples.

This is an approach to ecosystem valuation, an alternative to the traditional view of all non-human life as passive natural resources. But human knowledge and understanding of the natural environment is never complete, and therefore we cannot yet know what natural capital means exactly.

[[Lawn]]

CATEGORIES: Gardens

A lawn is an area of land planted with grass, and sometimes clover and other plants. Lawns are cut to a low, even height using a lawnmower. Lawns are used for aesthetic (for their beauty) and recreational purposes. Other words used to describe them are turf, pitch, field or green may be used, depending on the sport and the continent. They are often found around buildings, making them a type of yard.

Lawns are generally composed only of grass species, subject to weed and pest control, maintained in green colour, and are regularly maintained to ensure an acceptable length. Lawns are used around, apartments, houses, commercial buildings and offices. Approximately 80% of all homes in the United States have grass lawns. This has resulted in a $40 billion per year industry, with American grass lawns using more water than is used to grow all the wheat and corn in the United States.  In that sense, by water consumption, grass is the United States’ leading “crop” by far, with the Environmental Protection Agency estimating that about 1/3 of all public water is used to water grass, with that number rising as high as 70% in some of the more dry regions of the United States.

The earliest mention of lawns comes from France during the 1500s. Lawns (as opposed to fields) found their way to England in the 1700s. One acre (0.4 hectare) of lawn would take three gardeners all day to mow using a tool called a scythe. Two centuries later, one person with a lawnmower could do it in an afternoon.

Maria Salomea Skłodowska–Curie (Marie Curie) (7 November 1867 – 4 July 1934) was a Polish  physicist, chemist and feminist. She did research on radioactivity. She was also the first woman to win a Nobel Prize. She was the first woman professor at the University of Paris. She was the first person to win two Nobel Prizes. She received a Nobel Prize in physics for her research on uncontrolled radiation, which was discovered by Henri Becquerel.

She died because of too much exposure to radiation in her laboratory because she had no protection against the effects of radiation.

[[Flyover]]

CATEGORIES: Aviation

A flyover is something people do with airplanes or helicopters.  It means flying over people who are watching.  Sometimes the airplanes fly very low to make it more exciting.  The Blue Angels are a special group of pilots that do a lot of flyovers at events.

Sometimes military aircraft fly over the enemy to try to scare the people they are fighting against.

[[Blue Angels]]

CATEGORIES: United States Navy aircraft

The Blue Angels are a group of special pilots who work for the US Navy.  They fly F/A-18 fighter jet airplanes that are painted to look different from regular Navy planes.  They are very famous.  Almost every American has heard of them.  The pilots of the Blue Angels are very good at what they do.  They are able to fly very close to each other and do very difficult tricks.  They are most famous for the flyovers they do at many American sporting events.

[[Stunt performer]]

CATEGORIES: Entertainment occupations

A stunt performer, also called a stuntman or stuntwoman, is a person who performs dangerous acts usually within the television or movie production industry. In this line of work the stuntman (or woman) is paid to do those actions that are deemed too dangerous for the regular actor to perform, these include jumping from a height, falling down, being in a car crash, or pretending to fight with weapons such as swords or knives. These stunts are usually presented as a small feature within a larger production.

Action movies, war movies, martial arts movies, and crime television shows use many stunt performers to do the dangerous actions depicted in the movies or shows. Jackie Chan and the Blue Angels are examples of stunt performers who perform this kind of work.

There are, however, other stunt performers that present dangerous stunts to a live audience rather than as part of a larger story. Sometimes these are as standalone effects and sometimes as a feature within a larger stunt show. Escape artists, sword swallowers and other circus and sideshow acts are an example of this. These types of stunt performers can be found scattered throughout history with one of the most famous from the last Century being escape artist Harry Houdini.

[[Means of production]]

CATEGORIES: Factors of production, Construction, Tools, Materials

Means of production (abbreviated MoP; German: Produktionsmittel), also called means of labour are the materials, tools and other instruments used by workers to make products. This includes: machines, tools materials, plant and equipment, land, raw materials, money, energy, and anything else labor needs to make things.

The means of production can be owned by different people in different ways in different societies. Capitalism is when the means of production are owned privately. A capitalist society has a market, where things can be sold and bought. Capitalism also has wage labor. Other societies can be socialist, meaning the means of production are owned in common, either by the workers themselves or by the state.

[[Ecosystem services]]

CATEGORIES: Ecology, Green politics

Ecosystem services are processes by which the natural environment produces resources useful to people, as to economic services. They include:

To look at the way in which ecosystems provide goods is popular now at Stanford University. The concept of ecosystem services is similar to that of natural capital.

The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment released in 2005 showed that 60% of ecosystem services are used in a way that destroys them.

[[Year 2000 problem]]

CATEGORIES: 2000, Computing

The Year 2000 problem (also known as the Y2K problem, the millennium bug, Y2K Bug, and Y2K) was a computer problem that affected lots of computer systems. It happened because of the way in which some early computer programs were made to handle only years containing two digits (for example '92 instead of 1992). This meant that the computer could confuse the year 2000 with the year 1900, because both would be written as 00. People started fearing that date-related processing would happen incorrectly for dates and times after December 31 1999. It caused concerns that many industries (such as electricity or financial) and government functions would stop working at exactly midnight, January 1 2000. People were panicked by press coverage and media speculation, as well as corporate and government reports. Companies and organisations around the world had to check and upgrade their computer systems to avoid the bug. The preparation for Y2K had a significant effect on the computer industry. No big computer failures occurred when the year changed to 2000.

Peter William Ham (27 April 1947 – 24 April 1975) was a Welsh singer, songwriter and guitarist, best known as the prominent songwriter and singer of the 1970s group Badfinger.

Ham was born in Swansea, South Wales. He formed a local rock group called The Panthers in 1961. This group became The Iveys in 1965. The band was relocated to London by The Mojos manager, Bill Collins, in 1966, and they continued to perform for three years throughout the United Kingdom. Ham especially took to songwriting and Ray Davies of The Kinks took initial interest in producing his group. In 1968, The Iveys came to the attention of Mal Evans (The Beatles personal assistant) and were eventually signed to the Beatles' Apple label after approval from all four Beatles, who were most impressed by dozens of demos recorded at home, mostly by Pete.

The Iveys changed their name to Badfinger with the single release of "Come And Get It," a song written by Paul McCartney, which became a worldwide Top Ten hit. Ham's hard work paid off eventually as his song "No Matter What" became another worldwide Top Ten hit record in late 1970 . He followed up writing two more huge hits released in 1972, "Day After Day" and "Baby Blue" But the peak came with his co-written song "Without You" - a worldwide No. 1 hit as covered by Harry Nilsson in 1972. The song has since become one of the all-time ballad standards as covered by hundreds of singers including Mariah Carey and Clay Aiken. Ham was also used as a musician on Beatles solo records such as the "All Things Must Pass" LP by George Harrison and the single "It Don't Come Easy" by Ringo Starr.

[[Egalitarianism]]

CATEGORIES: Philosophical movements and positions

Egalitarianism is the belief that people should be equal to one another. The word is named for the French word égal, meaning equal or level.

There are many possible kinds of egalitarianism. For example, legal egalitarianism is the belief that groups of people should be equal in law even if they are of different race or religion. Gender egalitarianism is the idea that men and women are equally important, even though they are different.

This word may be used when talking about philosophy in many slightly different ways. We can best understand the different kinds of egalitarianism by asking, "Who is equal to whom?" and "How are they equal?"

[[English Wikipedia]]

CATEGORIES: Wikipedias, Websites established in 2001

The English Wikipedia is the English language edition of the Wikipedia online encyclopedia. English is the first language in which Wikipedia was written. It was started on 15 January 2001. It is the largest encyclopedia in the world, and the largest version of Wikipedia since April 2019. It has more than 6,085,700 articles as of May 2020. In October 2015, the total volume of the compressed texts of the English Wikipedia's articles added up to 11.5 gigabytes.

The Simple English Wikipedia is a variation in which most of the articles use only basic English vocabulary (simplewiki).  There is also the Old English (Ænglisc/Anglo-Saxon) Wikipedia (angwiki). It has a newsletter called The Signpost.

Wikipedias in other languages have imitated some of its technical and organizational features.

As the English Wikipedia is very popular, there can be many people editing the wiki in one minute. This made the Special:RecentChanges less effective for understanding changes. Instead, editors can select and watch for changes in particular articles, using the "watchlist" feature of MediaWiki. Some also use special software to detect and fix vandalism.

Some people think that the English Language Wikipedia shows bias and unfairness. Editors of reference works such as the Encyclopædia Britannica have questioned Wikipedia's utility and status as an encyclopedia. An example of bias is that around 90% of Wikipedia editors are male. Other people think that Wikipedia is more useful than other encyclopedias because it is large and can be updated quickly.

In 2012, the logo of the English Wikipedia like most Wikipedias was slightly changed. However, some Wikipedias, like the Simple English Wikipedia, still kept the old logo.

[[Jurisdiction]]

CATEGORIES: Law

In law, jurisdiction is the authority given to a judge to take decisions in matters concerning the law. The word comes from the Latin jus, juris meaning "law" and dicere meaning "to speak": and literally means: telling the law. Jurisdiction may be legally restricted to a certain period of time called a statute of limitations.

It also includes the authority a of formally constituted legal body or a political leader to deal with legal matters and, by implication, to administer justice within a defined area of responsibility. Jurisdiction relies on public International Law, conflict of laws, constitutional law and the powers of the executive and legislative branches of government to give resources to best serve the needs of its society.

[[Thermoplastic]]

CATEGORIES: Thermoplastics

A thermoplastic is a material, usually a plastic polymer, which becomes more soft when heated and hard when cooled. Thermoplastic materials can be cooled and heated several times without any change in their chemical or mechanical properties. When thermoplastics are heated to their melting point, they melt to a liquid. They freeze to a glassy state when cooled below their glass transition temperature. 

Thermoplastic materials have many features. Some products made from thermoplastic materials are used for electronic applications. They protect against electrostatic discharge and radio frequency interference. Thermoplastics are one of the main two types of plastics.

Thermoplastic can be moulded into any shape. Thermoplastics differ from thermosetting polymers. Thermosets form irreversible chemical bonds during the curing process.

Some of the crimes are drug offences, car theft, and driving with a suspended licence.  He has served prison sentences for drug possession and burglary.

[[Polycarbonate]]

CATEGORIES: thermoplastics

Polycarbonate is a transparent (something which can be seen through) thermoplastic. This material is tough and stable. It can resist a high temperature of 138°C (280°F) and a low temperature of -40°C (-40°F). It is stain resistant and non-toxic. The weight of polycarbonate is one sixth of glass. 

Industries use polycarbonate for making different products, from bulletproof windows to CDs and DVDs. The main advantages of polycarbonate are high strength and light weight.

Industries use clear polycarbonate to make glasses. This is because it has very good transparency and durability. Lenses made from clear polycarbonate can be thinner than lenses made from regular glass.

Companies that make electronic equipment use polycarbonate to make the cover of mobile phones, laptops and other products. Although polycarbonate is not poisonous, the process of making polycarbonate uses toxic chemicals. (See Bisphenol A).

[[Natural disaster]]

CATEGORIES: Natural disasters

A natural disaster is a major it is bot event caused by the natural processes of the Earth, consisting of floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, tsunamis and other geologic processes. A natural disaster causes loss of life or property damage, and leaves some economic damage afterwards costing millions. 

And often human activities also make causes of natural disasters, such as climate change and deforestation.

It is the damage to humans and their property which counts most. Therefore, one can say: "disasters occur when hazards meet vulnerability". If a strong earthquake happens in uninhabited areas, it is usually not seen as a disaster or a loss.

An adverse event will not rise to the level of a disaster if it occurs in an area without vulnerable population. In a vulnerable area, however, such as Nepal during the 2015 earthquake, an earthquake can have disastrous consequences and leave lasting damage, which can require years to repair.

[[Landslide]]

CATEGORIES: Geology, Landforms

A landslide includes a wide range of ground movements, such as rock falls, deep failure of slopes and shallow debris flows.

The biggest reason for a landslide is that there is a slope and material goes down the slope because of gravity.

But other things also contribute to landslides: 

An underlying reason is the nature of the material. For example, a thixotropic material such as mud or sand and water, can change from a gel to a sol by adding water or pressure, or shaking. It goes from being stable one minute to fluid the next minute. The greatest disasters, like lahars or mudslides, happen suddenly. It is possible for much of a volcano to just slide down suddenly, as with Toba, Krakatoa and Mount St Helens.

Americium is a chemical element. It is a radioactive metal. It has the chemical symbol Am. It has the atomic number 95. In chemistry it is placed in a group of metal elements named the actinides. Americium is a transuranic element (Transuranic means after uranium. All the elements used after uranium are man-made). It is a radioactive element that does not exist in nature. Americium has to be made. It has a silver color. Americium is made by bombarding a plutonium target with neutrons.

It was the fourth transuranic element to be discovered. It was named for America, like Francium was named for France.

The longest half life of any type of americium is 7370 years.

[[Debris]]

CATEGORIES: Waste

Debris in a general sense means man-made garbage. Debris is the scattered remains of something that is discarded or destroyed. There are many types of debris, depending on the context. When natural disasters happen, debris is the remains of destroyed buildings and land. In the context of geology, debris is the remains of geological activity such as landslides, volcanic eruptions, avalanches, and so on.

The average American produces garbage, also called trash, at the rate of four pounds per day per person, which translates to 600,000 tons per day, or about 220 million tons per year. This is almost twice the rate of trash generation per person as most other major countries. Trash levels can be reduced primarily by recycling, re-use, and reduced consumption.

Trash could mean:

TRASH refers to:

[[Waste heat]]

CATEGORIES: Heat, Energy, Waste

Waste heat is the by-product heat of machines and technical processes for which no useful application is found. 

A fraction of input energy is always converted to heat by friction between machine parts and other processes such as liquid friction (see: viscosity). 

Mechanical drives can be designed to run smoothly, with little loss of energy to heat. Machines for conversion of energy contained in fuels to mechanical work or electric energy produce large amounts of waste heat (see: Second law of thermodynamics). 

This waste heat can be re-used if a cogeneration system is used. It is hard to use waste heat because it is difficult to transport the heat to another place, and it is difficult to store the heat for use at another time.

In electrification of waste heat, organic matter can be used as a working medium to produce electricity on much lower temperatures compared to the water steam cycle. physics-stub

Built in 2005 to be the worlds tallest and fastest roller coaster Kingda Ka is one of only two strata coasters in the world. Kingda Ka held the record for the worlds fastest roller coaster until the completion of Formula Rossa at Ferrari World in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. Kingda Ka goes up 456 and can go 128. It first opened on May 21, 2005. To get up 456 feet, the train is launched by a machine to 128 miles per hour in 3 seconds. The train goes up the tower, and back down. At the bottom the train goes over a hill while it is slowing down. Soon it is going slow enough to be able to arrive safely back where it started. The ride lasts 28 seconds from the time it is launched.

[[Vulnerability]]

CATEGORIES: Social sciences

Vulnerability means the extent to which changes can hurt or harm a person or a system.

In context with natural hazards and natural disasters, vulnerability is a concept that looks at the relationship that people have with their environment and at social aspects.

So it links environment to social forces and institutions and the cultural values that sustain and contest them. “The concept of vulnerability expresses the multidimensionality of disasters by focusing attention on the totality of relationships in a given social situation which constitute a condition that, in combination with environmental forces, produces a disaster” (Bankoff et al. 2004: 11).

Complex definition: Vulnerability is the susceptibility to physical or emotional injury or attack. It also means to have one's guard down, open to censure or criticism; assailable. Vulnerability refers to a person's state of being liable to succumb, as to persuasion or temptation (see Thywissen 2006 for a comparison of vulnerability definitions).

[[Harm]]

CATEGORIES: Psychology

Harm is physical or psychological or emotional damage or injury to a person, animal or other legal entity. 

It is generally believed that humans, in addition to other sentient animal species, possess an aversion to causing harm to others.

Many religions consider any harm to another person a sin.

[[Liquid crystal display]]

CATEGORIES: Display technology, Television technology

A liquid crystal display is a special thin flat panel that can let light go through it, or can block the light. (Unlike an LED it does not produce its own light). The panel is made up of several blocks, and each block can be in any shape.  Each block is filled with liquid crystals that can be made clear or solid, by changing the electric current to that block.  Liquid crystal displays are often abbreviated LCDs. 

Liquid crystal displays are often used in battery-powered devices, such as digital watches, because they use very little electricity.  They are also used for flat screen TV's.  Many LCDs work well by themselves when there is other light around (like in a lit room, or outside in daylight).  For smartphones, computer monitor, TV's and some other purposes, a back-light is built into the product. This is  an LED or Cold Cathode Fluorescent Light (CCFL).

[[Body language]]

CATEGORIES: Non-verbal communication, Sociology

Body language is a form of non-verbal communication. Body language is about using behaviour to communicate. Both people and animals use this form of communication. Part of this behaviour is done subconsciously. It is therefore different from communicating using sign language, for example. Communication using sign language is intentional, body language is not.

The forms of behaviour used in body language include body posture, gestures, facial expressions, and eye movements.

Body language may provide clues as to the attitude or state of mind of a person. For example, it may indicate aggression, attentiveness, boredom, a relaxed state, pleasure, amusement, and intoxication.

Body language is significant to communication and relationships. It is relevant to management and leadership in business and also in places where it can be observed by many people. It can also be relevant to some outside of the workplace. It is commonly helpful in dating, mating, in family settings, and parenting. Although body language is non-verbal or non-spoken, it can reveal much about your feelings and meaning to others and how others reveal their feelings toward you. Body language signals happen on both a conscious and unconscious level.

[[Plagiarism]]

CATEGORIES: Education, Literature, Plagiarism, Copyright infringement

Plagiarism is copying another person's ideas, words or writing and pretending that they are one's own work. It can involve violating copyright laws.

[[Saturation]]

Saturation or saturated generally means "thoroughly full", while unsaturated means less than full. These terms may be related to:

[[Water content]]

CATEGORIES: Water, Soil

Water content means the amount of water present in a porous substance, such as soil. This term is used in hydrogeology, soil science and soil mechanics. In saturated groundwater aquifers, all available spaces are filled with water. Above a capillary fringe, pore spaces have air in them too.

Gaps between soil particles are called pore spaces or voids. These voids contain various amounts of either water or air. Soil moisture content can be expressed in different basis:

The amount of void space within a soil depends on the distribution of particle sizes, and is quantified by soil porosity.

Soil moisture is more generally considered within the context of hydrology, where it represents the immediate store of infiltrating rainfall, before it either evapotranspires or contributes to groundwater recharge.

[[Black metal]]

CATEGORIES: Heavy metal subgenres

Black metal is an extreme style of Heavy metal that started in the early 1980s. Lyrics are often for religions such as Satanism. Various black metal bands have relations to satanism in their lyrics and even in outlook. Lyrics may also have subjects such as Paganism. The majority of black metal vocalists are male, although there are a few notable exceptions – for example Cadaveria, Astarte and Lucifugum.

Black metal is divided into two waves. The first wave began in the early 1980s by bands such as Venom, Bathory, Hellhammer, Celtic Frost and Mercyful Fate. Venom's first albums, Welcome to Hell and Black Metal are usually said to be the first black metal records. The second wave is the most popular wave of black metal and it started in the early 1990s. It started from Norway and includes bands such as Darkthrone, Enslaved, Burzum, Satyricon, Mayhem, Gorgoroth, Immortal, and Emperor.

Black metal is also very controversial, especially in Norway. During the early 1990s, certain black metal musicians burned old churches in Norway. One of the people who was found guilty for burning churches, Varg Vikernes, was also found guilty for murdering Øystein Aarseth, a fellow black metal musician.

[[Darkness]]

CATEGORIES: Light

Darkness is when there no light. In practice, out in the open air, there almost always is some light, however slight. The darkness of the night sky is estimated by a nine-point scale known as the Bortle scale.

Darkness is made by blocking light from the sun or some other source of light, which makes shadow. At night the Earth blocks the sun, and casts a shadow over one entire side of the world. There is heat radiation even in the dark. 

In mythology, darkness is often connected with evil. Many people are uncomfortable or afraid when in the dark, especially children.

In religion, darkness is considered as beginning of the world, before the light appeared.  At the same time, the darkness was "the second to last plague" (Exodus 10:21).

[[Harthacanute]]

CATEGORIES: 1018 births, 1042 deaths, Kings and Queens of Denmark, People buried in Winchester Cathedral

Harthacanute (Canute the Hardy, sometimes Hardicanute, Hardecanute; Danish: Hardeknud) (1018 – 8 June 1042) was King of Denmark from 1035 to 1042 and England from 1040 to 1042. He was the only son of Canute the Great and Emma of Normandy.

He followed his father as King of Denmark in 1035, becoming Canute III. Fighting with Magnus I of Norway stopped him from sailing to England to take up his throne. His older, illegitimate half-brother, Harold Harefoot, became regent of England.

Harold took the English crown for himself in 1037. After Harthacanute had settled the situation in Scandinavia he prepared an invasion of England to take over his kingdom. Harold died, and Harthacanute was able to take back his throne peacefully.

Harthacanute was a harsh and unpopular ruler. To pay for his ships, he greatly increased the rate of taxation. In 1041, the people of Worcester killed two of Harthacanute's men who had been collecting the tax. Harthacanute burned the city. The story of Lady Godiva riding naked through the streets of Coventry to persuade the local earl to lower taxes, may come from the reign of Harthacanute. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle says of him: "He never accomplished anything kingly for as long as he ruled".

In 1041, Harthacanute asked his half-brother Edward the Confessor (his mother Emma's son by Ethelred the Unready) back from exile in Normandy to become a member of his household, and probably made Edward his heir. Harthacanute was unmarried and had no children. On 8 June 1042, he died at Lambeth— he "died as he stood at his drink, and he suddenly fell to the earth". He was buried at Winchester Cathedral, Hampshire. Edward became the new king.

[[Harold Harefoot]]

CATEGORIES: 1010s births, 1040 deaths

Harold Harefoot, also Harold I, (c. 1015 – 17 March 1040) was King of England from 1035 to 1040. He was said to be the son of Canute the Great, King of England, Denmark, Norway, and some of Sweden, by his wife Aelgifu of Northampton. There was skepticism about his being Canute's son.

Upon Canute's death (12 November 1035), Harold's younger half-brother Harthacanute, the son of Canute and his queen, Emma of Normandy, was legitimate heir to the thrones of both the Danes and the English. He was unable to travel to his coronation, because his Danish kingdom was under threat of invasion by King Magnus I of Norway and King Anund Jacob of Sweden. Therefore, he was installed temporarily as regent though Godwin the Earl of Wessex and the Queen were against it.

Harold died at Oxford on 17 March 17 1040, just as Harthacanute was preparing an invasion force of Danes, and was buried at the abbey of Westminster.

[[English Interregnum]]

CATEGORIES: History of the British Isles

The English Interregnum was the period of parliamentary and military rule in the land occupied by modern-day England and Wales after the English Civil War. It began with the execution of Charles I in 1649 and ended when Charles II became king, after Oliver Cromwell died in 1660.

This era in English history can be divided into four periods.

[[Interregnum]]

CATEGORIES: Periods and ages in history, Monarchy

An interregnum is a period between monarchs, between popes of the Roman Catholic Church, emperors of Holy Roman Empire, Polish kings (elective monarchy) or between consuls of the Roman Republic. It can also refer any gap in the continuity of a government, organization, or social order. The period of interregnum may be peaceful, or it may collapse into chaos and anarchy.

In some monarchies, such as the United Kingdom, an interregnum is usually avoided due to a rule described as "the king is dead, long live the King", i.e. the heir to the throne becomes a new monarch immediately on his predecessor's death or abdication. This famous phrase signifies the continuity of sovereignty. This is not so in other monarchies where the new monarch's reign begins only with coronation or some other formal or traditional event. 

[[Oliver Cromwell]]

CATEGORIES: 1599 births, 1658 deaths, Alumni of the University of Cambridge, English heads of state

Oliver Cromwell (25 April 1599 – 3 September 1658) was an English military and political leader best known for making England a republic and leading the Commonwealth of England and primarily because of ethnic cleansing activities in Ireland euphemistically called as Cromwellian Genocide. 

Cromwell's actions during his career seem confusing to us today. He supported Parliament against the King, yet he ordered his soldiers to break up parliament. Under his rule, the Protectorate said that people's religious beliefs should be respected, but people who went against what most people believed were sometimes tortured and imprisoned.

Cromwell was the first ruler of England to be a Puritan. He created a new model army. Many English people today think he was one of their greatest leaders.

[[The Restoration]]

CATEGORIES: History of the British Isles

The Restoration was an time in the history of the British Isles that started in 1660. In 1660 the House of Stuart was restored to power after the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. The Restoration came after The Protectorate, when Oliver Cromwell and his son Richard Cromwell had led the government. The kingdoms of England, Scotland, and Ireland started to have a monarchy again. "The Restoration" means both the events at the start of Charles II's reign and the period of time after they happened.

Charles II came back to England after his exile and he became king of England, Scotland, and Ireland. Before this, the British Isles's monarchy had stopped after Charles I's execution. The three kingdoms became a republic, without a monarchy: the Commonwealth of England, Scotland, and Ireland.

Literature and culture of the Restoration period can also have the name "Restoration". (For example, Restoration drama is the theatre and plays of the Restoration period.)

[[Commonwealth of England]]

CATEGORIES: History of the British Isles

The Commonwealth of England was the republican government which ruled first England and then Ireland and Scotland from 1649 to 1660. After the execution of Charles I on January 30, 1649, the Commonwealth was declared (An Act declaring England to be a Commonwealth) by the Rump Parliament on May 19, 1649. The government during 1653 to 1659 is properly called The Protectorate, and took the form of direct personal rule by Oliver Cromwell and, after his death, his son Richard, as Lord Protector. The term Commonwealth is, however, loosely used to describe the system of government during the whole of 1649 to 1660, the years of the English Interregnum.

[[Declaration]]

 Declaration can mean:

[[Declaration of independence]]

A declaration of independence is a proclamation of the independence of an aspiring state or states. Such states are usually formed from part or all of the territory of another nation or failed nation, or are breakaway territories from within the parent state.

Declarations of independence are typically made without the consent of the parent state, and hence are sometimes called unilateral declarations of independence (UDI), particularly by those who question the validity of John Adams

DADE Republic has won the independence os Spain the 26 October 2017, DADE Republic has become as one of the biggest countries around the world.

[[Presbyterianism]]

CATEGORIES: Presbyterianism

Presbyterianism is a kind of Protestant Christianity.  It was started in Scotland by John Knox during the 16th century.  It became powerful in England during the Civil War.  Today there are Presbyterian churches across the world.

Presbyterians (followers of Presbyterianism) believe that the Bible is the most important thing in their church because it was given to humans by God and has no errors in it. They believe that God has control over everything and has chosen to make some people follow Jesus Christ but not others, and that only followers of Jesus may get into heaven. (See Calvinism)

Presbyterian churches may be led by men called Ministers, Rectors or Elders. Some Presbyterian churches have women as elders. "Presbyter" means "elder" and they rule in committees. 

There is no overall leader and there are no bishops in the Presbyterian tradition. On Sunday, the Bible, which they consider the 'Word of God', is read and a sermon preached by the minister is at the heart of a morning worship service, which also includes group singings of some worship songs.

[[Declaration of war]]

CATEGORIES: War

A declaration of war is a formal declaration issued by a national government indicating that a state of war exists between that nation, and one or more others.

Declarations of war have been used in diplomacy since the Renaissance, when the first formal declarations of war were issued.

In an effort to force nations to resolve issues without warfare, the United Nations Charter attempted to commit member nations to using warfare only under limited circumstances, such as to defend when attacked. Wars continued to begin and end, but powerful states no longer declared them.

Silent Spring is the name of a book by Rachel Carson. It was published in 1962. It tells of the damage done to the environment by the use of chemicals to kill pests. The book is widely credited with helping launch the modern American environmental movement.

The book documented detrimental effects of pesticides such as DDT on wildlife, particularly birds. Carson accused the chemical industry of spreading disinformation, and public officials of accepting industry claims uncritically.

[[Nymph (biology)]]

CATEGORIES: Insects, Developmental biology

For the spirit, see nymph

In zoology, a nymph is the young stage of some kinds of invertebrates, especially insects.

Insects grow by metamorphosis. In incomplete metamorphosis, an insect egg hatches, and a small nymph comes out. The nymph usually looks just like the adult insect but is much smaller. Nymphs do not become pupae before becoming adults. They just grow larger. They moult through various stages called instars.

Some insects have nymphs that are aquatic, which means they live in water. These nymphs look very different from the adults. Dragonflies have nymphs that live in water, such as in lakes and rivers. Nymphs that live in water are sometimes called naiads.

The other way insects grow is by complete metamorphosis. This way has no nymphs. The adult form is prepared in the pupa, and comes out perfect.

Some insects that are nymphs when they are young are grasshoppers, cockroaches, true bugs and dragonflies.

[[The Protectorate]]

CATEGORIES: History of the British Isles

The Protectorate was the period of British history during which the Commonwealth of England, Scotland, and Ireland was governed by a Lord Protector, which was from 1653 to 1659.

Before the Protectorate, England (and then Scotland and Ireland) had been ruled directly by Parliament since it had declared England to be a Commonwealth in 1649. The Rump Parliament had been sent away in April 1653 by soldiers led by Oliver Cromwell. Although the replacement Barebones Parliament (July–December 1653), was nominated by Cromwell and the leaders of the army, it was just as difficult to control.

The post of Lord Protector was created by a constitution passed in December 1653, which gave Cromwell the position for life. Although the constitution divided power between the Lord Protector, the Council of State and Parliament, there was in practice again the strong executive power that had been absent since the end of the monarchy. Cromwellian government has been called 'one of the first experiments in (de facto) military dictatorship' (Abbott).

During the Protectorate, there was Puritan legislation. Religious toleration was extended to Jews and most Protestants but not Anglicans or Roman Catholics.

After Cromwell's death in September 1658, the new Lord Protector, Richard Cromwell, was unable to control the army and resigned in May 1659. After the chaotic English Interregnum, the monarchy was restored in May 1660 through the initiative of General George Monck.

[[Anglo-Saxons]]

CATEGORIES: Germanic tribes, Anglo-Saxons

The Anglo-Saxons were the dominant people living in England from the mid-5th century AD until the Norman conquest in 1066. They spoke Germanic languages and are identified by Bede as the descendants of three powerful tribes. These were the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes. Their language, Anglo-Saxon or Old English, came from West Germanic dialects. It changed into Middle English from about the 11th century. Old English was divided into four main dialects: West Saxon, Mercian, Northumbrian and Kentish. 

The Anglo-Saxon culture replaced the Celtic culture in the area that is now England. Modern historians do not think that the Anglo-Saxons drove the Celts away, but instead that they became an upper class to the Celts in England, and the Celts then became part of the Anglo-Saxon culture. They never conquered Wales but Anglo-Saxon kings did claim overlordship from time to time. Some Anglo-Saxons came to Britain as warriors, but others came peacefully to become farmers or to raise families.

[[Norman conquest of England]]

CATEGORIES: Wars involving England, Normandy, 1066 in England

The Norman conquest of England was a military invasion of England by William the Conqueror in 1066.

William was Duke of Normandy, a country on the other side of the English Channel, now a region in France. He invaded England after the death of King Edward the Confessor because he believed he had the most right to be King of England, but King Harold II had himself crowned king instead. King Harold, with his Saxon army, and Duke William fought at the Battle of Hastings on October 14, 1066. King Harold was killed in the battle and his army left. On December 25, 1066 William was crowned the new King of England.

The Norman conquest was an important change in English history. The conquest linked England more closely with Continental Europe, and made Scandinavian influence less important. It created one of the most powerful monarchies in Europe.  The conquest changed the English language and culture, and set the stage for rivalry with France, which would continue (with a few breaks) until the 19th century. 

England has never been successfully invaded since the Norman invasion nearly 1000 years ago.

[[Raid]]

[[English Reformation]]

CATEGORIES: History of the British Isles, Protestant Reformation

The English Reformation was part of the Protestant Reformation. Many Christian churches in Europe broke away from  Rome. Each of the countries that went through this process did so in a different way. Earlier the Roman Catholic Church had supreme powers. 

Henry VIII broke ties with the church and became head of the English church. This was done in 1534 in the Acts of Supremacy. It was the beginning of the Church of England. His friend Thomas Cranmer became Henry's Archbishop of Canterbury. For years, the Church of England was almost exactly the same as the Catholic Church, except that it was ruled by the King instead of the Pope. This is different from the Reformation on the European continent, where the reformers wanted big changes right away. 

There were several causes for the English Reformation. One of these was that Henry VIII, who was King of England, wanted to divorce his wife, Catherine of Aragon. Another reason was because Henry wanted the Church's wealth and power, and got them with the dissolution of the monasteries.  

The Protestant Reformation in Scotland, however, was based more on the teachings of Martin Luther and John Calvin, so it was more like the Reformation in continental Europe. 

[[Gianluigi Buffon]]

CATEGORIES: 1978 births, Living people, Italian association football goalkeepers

Gianluigi "Gigi" Buffon (born 28 January 1978) is an Italian professional footballer who plays in the goalkeeper position. He is a Goalkeeper for the Serie B team Parma Calcio. He used to play for the Italy national team from 1996 till he retired in 2018. Buffon is recognized by many peoples as one of the greatest goalkeepers of all time, and, by some, as the greatest ever.

Gianluigi Buffon started his career in Parma and won a UEFA Cup in 1999. In 2001, he transferred to the Italian giant Juventus and won the Serie A on consecutive years.

Buffon joined the Italy national team in 1997. In the 2006 FIFA World Cup, he led them to the championship, allowing only two goals in 7 games and keeping 5 clean sheets (no goals allowed), which was a new World Cup record at that time.

[[Checksum]]

CATEGORIES: Computer science

A checksum is a number. It is a kind of redundancy check. There are different ways to calculate it. It serves as a check, that no errors have been made when writing down the number. In its simplest form, the digits are simply added up. This can however not detect errors of swapping digits around. Better ways (algorithms) of calculating a checksum are to use a Hamming code, a cyclic redundancy check or modular arithmetic. One of the uses of checksums is to check that account numbers have been entered correctly. 

Portuguese bank account identifiers are a good example of how checksums work. They have 21 digits. The first 19 digits identify the bank, branch and account number.  The last two digits are "mod 97" checksum digits based on modular arithmetic. A typical Portuguese bank account number is 0002.0123.12345678901.54. The digits have the following meanings:

If 000201231234567890154 (the bank account number without the dots) is divided by 97, the answer is 207458809978249 remainder 1. Since the remainder is "1", the bank account identifier is probably correct. If the person writing down the number missed a digit, swapped two digits around or wrote a digit down incorrectly the remainder would not have been "1". If this is the case then the computer should detect an error and give an error message.   

Another place where checksums are used are serial numbers for computer software.

[[Viet Cong]]

The National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam (NLF), was a communist army based in South Vietnam that fought against the governments of South Vietnam and the United States during the Vietnam War (1955-75). The group is better known as the Viet Cong (Việt Cộng) or V.C., short for "Vietnamese Communist." American soldiers called the Vietnamese communist forces Charlie (which is the letter "C" in the NATO phonetic alphabet), no matter whether North Vietnamese or Vietcong.

The group was made up of people from both South and North Vietnam. Some were not communists, but the main leaders were. The Vietcong used guerilla warfare, including terrorist bombings, assassinations, and ambushes. The group is best known for the Tet Offensive, an surprise attack on many South Vietnamese cities that began on January 1968 during Tet, or Vietnamese New Year. The group was closely allied with the government of North Vietnam, which conquered the South in 1975.

According to 'Re-thinking Camelot' (Noam Chomsky 1993) the NLF resistance was, in part, the result of terror inflicted upon them by the US backed and guided government of South Vietnam, carried out while the NLF were peacefully awaiting elections promised by the Geneva Accords of 1954.

[[NATO phonetic alphabet]]

CATEGORIES: Alphabets, Aviation, Military, Flags

The NATO phonetic alphabet is a way of using words to replace letters. The first letter of the word is the letter the word stands for. Although it is called a "phonetic alphabet" it is not really used for phonetics like the International Phonetic Alphabet or other phonetic alphabets. It is used to clearly say letters out loud when they might be hard to hear such as over the phone or when people are talking from different countries, or when it is important to be accurate such as in the military and in air travel. There have been many different phonetic alphabets over time. On board ships, flags are used to stand for letters, and each have their own meanings. Different countries also have different phonetic alphabets used in any subject

In modern use, the word is used to refer to an uncivilized or uncultured person. 

It is used for a member of a nation or ethnic group which is seen as having a lower level of civilization, or for an individual person which is seen as a brutal, cruel and insensitive or whose behaviour is unacceptable in the civilized society of the speaker. When used for a person the word is always pejorative, when used for a nation not always.  

[[Numerical digit]]

CATEGORIES: Mathematics

Numerical digits are the number text characters used to show numerals. For example, the numeral "56" has two digits: 5 and 6. In the decimal system (which is base 10), each digit is how many of a certain power of 10 are needed to get the value. The rightmost, or units digit, is for 10^0, the next digit is for 10^1, etc.

The numeral "56" means:  6*10^0 + 5*10^1 = 6*1 + 5*10 = 6 + 50.

The ten digits of the decimal system are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Some numeral systems need more than ten digits. For example, the hexadecimal numeral system uses 16 symbols to represent numericals : 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, and F.

Evanescence is an American alternative metal/rock band. It was founded in 1995 in Little Rock, Arkansas by singer Amy Lee and former-guitarist Ben Moody. The band gained local popularity and released a number of EPs before signing a record deal with Wind-Up.

The band released Fallen, their first full-length album, in 2003. Fallen gained popularity after two of its songs were featured in the film Daredevil. The album was a critical and commercial success and sold more than 17 million copies worldwide; spawning the hit singles “Bring Me to Life” and “My Immortal”. It also helped the band win two Grammy awards.

In 2006, the band released their second studio album, The Open Door, which was positively received. It debuted at #1 in the Billboard Hot 200 chart, and sold more than 447.000 copies in its first week. The album sold more than 6 million copies and its third single, “Sweet Sacrifice”, was honored with a Grammy nomination for Best Hard Rock Song.

After concluding “The Open Door Tour", the band went on a lengthy hiatus. The band announced that they would be working on a new album in June 2009, but the production was delayed several times. Evanescence, the bands’ self-titled third studio album, was eventually released on October 11, 2011. It debuted at #1 in 5 Billboard charts, including the Hot 200 and Rock Albums charts. “What You Want” became the first single off the album, and was released in August 9, 2011 to positive critical reception. “My Heart is Broken” was chosen as the second single and sent to radio stations in October 31, 2011. An accompanying video premiered on Evanescence’s Vevo account on YouTube on January 28, 2012. Lee has confirmed via a Twitter message that the third single will be “Made of Stone”. A remixed version “Made of Stone” was featured in the soundtrack of the 2012 film Underworld: Awakening.

The band has suffered many line-up changes throughout the years. David Hodges was the first member to exit the band in 2002. Co-founder Moody left the band mid-tour in 2004 due to creative differences with frontwoman Lee, followed by Will Boyd in 2006. In 2007, Lee fired guitarist John LeCompt and drummer Rocky Gray announced he was quitting the band shortly after. As of mid-2007, Lee is the only original member left in the band.

Evanescence was ranked at #71 on the Best Artists of the Decade chart. As a female-fronted band that utilizes dramatic vocals and orchestral elements in their music, critics and fans have drawn parallels between Evanescence and other female-fronted symphonic and gothic metal bands such as Lacuna Coil. The band is recognized for their dark music and lyrics, Lee’s vocals and piano instrumentations against the background of “chugging” guitar riffs and their use of electronic elements.

Originally, the Bill of Rights had 12 different amendments, but the first two were not passed by enough states. The second amendment that was not passed was eventually added to the Constitution in 1992, becoming the 27th amendment in the Constitution.

Sometimes, the movement is voluntary, but sometimes, people are forced to move. They may suffer warfare, religious and political persecution, famine, and other natural disasters.

When people are forced to move, they are refugees. Many refugees are illegal immigrants and more than half are children and women. They may live in extreme poverty, lacking food, shelter, clothing, education and medical care.

She uploaded her song He invites me to Disneyland to her band's forum, her Xanga site, i010.com and also cmidi.com for free downloading by Internet users. The song became very famous with the help of the Internet within a few weeks. The song was also number 1 of Yahoo! Hong Kong's Top Searches (搜尋人氣榜) for some time.April 2009 Some DJs also played the song on the radio. Many people were happy about her, although some also thought she did not have good singing skills.

[[European Parliament]]

CATEGORIES: European Parliament, European Union

The European Parliament (formerly European Parliamentary Assembly or Common Assembly) is the parliament of the European Union (EU). EU citizens elect its members once every five years. Together with the Council of Ministers, it is the law-making branch of the institutions of the Union. It meets in two locations: Strasbourg and Brussels .

[[Council of the European Union]]

CATEGORIES: European Union, Legislatures

The Council of the European Union (often called 'Council of Ministers or just Council') is one of the three organisations that manage the European Union. Along with the European Parliament, it is responsible for law making for the European Union (EU).

Its members are the government ministers of the member countries who are responsible for the law that is being discussed. As an example, suppose the law is going to be about farming, then the Agriculture Ministers are the Council for that day.

As well as making laws, they can meet to discuss their problems. For example, the European Union does not decide on tax - each country decides on its own tax. But the Finance Ministers meet anyway because sometimes they can help each other catch people who do not want to pay tax at all.

The Council is called different things in different countries, according to the language they speak (for example in French it is Conseil de l'Union Européenne and in German it is Rat der Europäischen Union). It is also known internationally, and so it appears on its logo, with the Latin word Consilium.

A simple way of putting it, is that The 'Council of the European Union' is helped by most countries in the world and it is very important.

One of these people is the President, who was chosen by the Council and Parliament, he decides (with each country) who the other members are and what they do. Each one has a different job, such as looking after industry or trade. If they do not do their job properly, the President can remove them. If he does not, or if the President does not do his job, the Parliament can remove the whole Commission from their jobs (this only happened in 1999).

The name Commission can also mean the 25,000 people who work for the President and his team. They follow the Commission's instructions in looking after the EU or writing a new law. It works in three languages, English, French and German.

The first Commission was created in 1952 and was called the "High Authority". But the modern Commission was created in 1957 and since then has had twelve Presidents;

[[Amusement arcade]]

CATEGORIES: Arcade games

An amusement arcade (also called a video arcade or just arcade) is a place where people play arcade games such as video games, pinball machines, and slot machines.  

The earliest amusement arcades were called "penny arcades." They were opened in the nineteenth century. Penny arcades had game machines called "bagatelles", which were like billiards and pinball. Penny arcades were popular at amusement parks and fairs until around the 1950s. Around this time, the penny arcades were often replaced by more modern games of chance and skill. An example of the new machines were shooting galleries.

Videos were introduced in amusement arcades in the late 1970s. These were most popular during the early 1980s. Arcades became popular with young people. Many video arcades began closing in the late 1990s, as the technology of home video game consoles began to rival and eventually exceed that of arcade games. However, video arcades remained popular in Japan, where they are called game centers.

[[Ice age]]

CATEGORIES: Landforms, Geological periods, Climate change

An ice age is a period when for a long time the temperature of Earth's climate is very low. This leads to an expansion of the continental ice sheets, polar ice sheets and mountain glaciers.

Ice age is a term used in palaeoclimatology for the period of extensive ice sheets in the recent Pleistocene period. We now know that ice ages have happened a number of times in the past, the greatest and longest of which took place in the Proterozoic era, before multi-cellular eukaryotes evolved.

During ice ages the sea level drops as water is held in the great ice sheets at the poles. How much it drops depends on several factors, such as the length of time that a cold period lasts.

[[Saxons]]

CATEGORIES: Germanic tribes, Anglo-Saxons, German people, Dutch people, Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, Schleswig-Holstein, Groningen (province), Drenthe, Overijssel, Gelderland

The Saxons or Saxon people are (today) a part of the German people, with their main areas of settlements in the German States of Schleswig-Holstein, Lower Saxony, Westphalia, and the northeastern part of the Netherlands (Groningen, Drenthe, Twente, Salland, Veluwe and Achterhoek).  

First told about by the Ancient Greek geographer Jean Julien, the pre-Christian area of the Saxon people first covered an area a little more to the northwest, with parts of the southern Jutland peninsula, Old Saxony and small parts of the eastern Netherlands. During the 5th century AD, the Saxons were part of the people invading the Romano-British province of Britannia, and so formed the Anglo-Saxons.

Before Christianization, the Saxons had much native pre-Christian Germanic paganism. After Christianization, parts of this religion remained up to today in people who came from the Saxons.

The word 'Saxon' is thought to come from the word seax, meaning a mixture of single-edged knives. The Saxons were thought by Charlemagne, and some people who study history, to be very war-like and angry.  

Many of the words that we use today were created by the Saxons for example, radish. 

The Finnish and Estonian name for Germany, Saksa, comes from the Saxons.

CATEGORIES: Moulds

Mould (or mold) is a type of fungus. It grows in the form of multicellular filaments called hyphae. In contrast, fungi that can adopt a single-celled growth habit are called yeasts.

Molds are a large group of fungi. The growth of their hyphae results in discoloration and a fuzzy appearance, especially on food. The network of these tubular branching hyphae, called a mycelium, is considered a single organism. 

Mould grows from spores, which float around in the air. 

There are thousands of different kinds. Some molds cause disease or food spoilage. Sometimes people use them to make some kinds of cheese. Many antibiotics are developed from natural anti-bacterial substance made by moulds.

Mold or mould, also sometimes referred to as mildew, is a fungal growth that develops on wet materials. Mold is a natural part of the environment and plays an important part in nature by breaking down dead organic matter such as fallen leaves and dead trees; indoors, mold growth should be avoided and proper inspection should be done for effective mold removal.

[[Guayana Esequiba]]

CATEGORIES: History of South America, Venezuela, Guyana

Guayana Esequiba is the name Venezuela gives to a region that it claims in the west of Guyana. Its area is 159,500 square kilometers.  For Guyana, this area is divided into the six administrative regions of Barima-Waini, Cuyuni-Mazaruni, Pomeroon-Supenaam, Potaro-Siparuni, Upper Takutu-Upper Essequibo and Essequibo Islands-West Demerara. 

Spain made its first claim on this area in a report dated 10 July 1788:

It has been stated that the south coast of the Orinoco from the point of Barima, 20 leagues more or less inland, up to the creek of Curucima, is low lying and swampy land and, so, reckoning all this tract as useless, very few patches of fertile land being found therein, and hardly any savannahs and pastures, it is disregarded; so taking as chief base the said creek of Curucima, or the point of the chain and ridge in the great arm of the Imataka, an imaginary line will be drawn running to the south-south-east following the slopes of the ridge of the same name which is crossed by the Rivers Aguire, Arature and Amacuro, and others, in the distance of 20 leagues, direct to the Cuyuni; from there it will run on to the Masaruni and Essequibo, parallel to the sources of the Berbis and Surinama; this is the directing line of the course which the new Settlements and foundations proposed must follow.

In 1840, Venezuela claimed all of Guyana west of the Essequibo River – 62% of what was then British Guiana. Britain and Venezuela argued over the boundary between British Guiana and Venezuela for much of the 19th century. On 21 February 1881, in a note to Lord Grenville, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Great Britain at that time, Venezuela suggested a border line starting from a point one mile to the north of the Moruka River, drawn from there westward to the 60th meridian, and running south along that meridian. This would have given the Barima District to Venezuela. The Government of Venezuela, in the case it made to the Arbitration Tribunal, changed its claim on the district just west of the Essequibo, and claimed that the boundary should run from the mouth of the Moruka River southwards to the Cuyuni River, near where it meets the Mazaruni River, and then along the east bank of the Essequibo to the Brazilian border. Britain and Venezuela accepted the decision of the Tribunal in 1899.

Venezuela raised the issue again in 1962, four years before Guyana won independence from Britain. At a meeting in Geneva in 1966, the two countries agreed to hear ideas from a representative of the UN Secretary General on ways to settle the dispute peacefully. There are still diplomatic contacts between the two countries and the Secretary General's representative.

On recognizing the independence of Guyana on 26 May 1966, Venezuela said:

Venezuela recognizes as territory of the new State the one which is located on the east of the right bank of the Essequibo River, and reiterates before the new State, and before the international community, that it expressly reserves its rights of territorial sovereignty over all the zone located on the west bank of the above-mentioned river. Therefore, the Guyana-Essequibo territory over which Venezuela expressly reserves its sovereign rights, limits on the east by the new State of Guyana, through the middle line of the Essequibo River, beginning from its source and on to its mouth in the Atlantic Ocean.

Venezuelan maps drawn since 1970 show all the area from the eastern bank of the Essequibo, including the islands in the river, as Venezuelan territory. On some maps, the western Essequibo region is called the "Zone of Reclamation".

[[Sudeley Castle]]

CATEGORIES: Castles in England

Sudeley Castle is a castle near Winchcombe, Gloucestershire, England, United Kingdom. It was built in 1441 by Ralph Boteler, who had the castle confiscated by Edward IV of England. Edward gave Sudeley Castle to his brother, who later became Richard III of England, who then gave it to his uncle Jasper Tudor, Duke of Bedford.

By the time Henry VIII of England succeeded, the castle was the property of the Crown again. It had been visited by Henry in 1535, with his second wife Anne Boleyn, but had been empty and unattended for some time. When Henry died the castle became the property of his son, Edward VI of England, who gave it to his uncle, Thomas Seymour. Thomas was made Lord of Sudeley and married the King's stepmother, Catherine Parr. During this time Thomas began to regenerate the castle for Catherine's use, but only one room that he had built remains today.

Seymour and Catherine moved into the castle and brought with them ladies to attend on the Queen Dowager, as well as gentlemen of the household and Yeomen of the guard. The castle was then home to over 100 people. Another famous figure who came to live in the castle of Lady Jane Grey, who was a ward of Seymour's, as well as the young Elizabeth I of England.

Catherine died after she had given birth to a daughter, Mary, at Sudeley Castle and was buried in its St. Mary's Chapel. Her grave was discovered in 1728 after the castle and the chapel had been left in ruins by the English Civil War. She was later reinterred by the Rector of Sudeley in 1817. 

Seymour's ambitions led to him being arrested and beheaded, after which Sudeley Castle became the property of Catherine's brother William Parr, who was the Marquess of Nothampton. Parr was stripped of his property and title after being involved in the failed attempt to make Lady Jane Grey Queen of England.

In 1554 Mary I of England gave Sudeley Castle John Brydges, Lord Chandos and it remained as his property throughout the reign of Elizabeth I of England. Elizabeth was entertained three times at Sudeley Castle, which including a spectacular feast in 1592 to celebrate the anniversary of the defeat of the Spanish Armada.

[[Germanic peoples]]

CATEGORIES: Germanic peoples, Ancient history

The Germanic peoples are a linguistic and ethnic branch of Indo-European peoples. They came from Northern Europe and are identified by their use of the Germanic languages. Migrating Germanic peoples spread throughout Europe, mixing with existing local populations (such as Celts, but also Slavs/Vends and Romans), forming the future basis of many nations, that are connected by similar languages and common history, and culture.

Latin Germani is first used by Julius Caesar.

But the Germanic tribes did not have a self name that included all Germanic-speaking people. In English, German is first attested in 1520, replacing earlier use of Almain or Dutch. Dutch is now used in the English language to refer to the language and the inhabitants of the Netherlands.

By the 1st century A.D., the writings of Caesar, Tacitus and other Roman era writers indicate a division of Germanic-speaking peoples into tribal groupings centred on:

The Sons of Mannus Istvaeones, Irminones, and Ingvaeones are collectively called West Germanic tribes. In addition, those Germanic people who remained in Scandinavia are referred to as North Germanic. These groups all developed separate dialects, the basis for the differences among Germanic languages down to the present day.

The division of peoples into West Germanic, East Germanic, and North Germanic is a modern linguistic classification.

The Germanic tribes were each politically independent, under a hereditary king (see Germanic king). The kings appear to have claimed descendancy from mythical founders of the tribes, the name of some of which is preserved:

During 1973, Lennon and Ono began to have problems in their marriage. Ono trusted Pang, and suggested her as a companion for Lennon, knowing he wanted to see other women. Lennon surprised Ono by taking Pang with him to Los Angeles, where he planned to record an album with Phil Spector. Lennon and Pang lived together for over a year, while he worked on new music, and tried to decide whether to divorce Ono or reconcile with her.

Lennon and Ono decided to reconcile early in 1975, and became the parents of Sean Lennon. Even though Pang had been involved with the marketing of several of Lennon's records, and also records by Harry Nilsson and Ringo Starr, she had a hard time finding a new job. She later found out the reason was because many companies were afraid Lennon would not want to do business with them, if he knew she worked there.

Pang finally found a job with Island Records, and later worked for RKO. She married record producer Tony Visconti (the former husband of singer Mary Hopkin), and they started a family. After Lennon's death in 1980, Pang wrote a memoir, titled Loving John. She also appeared on many talk shows, to discuss her relationship with Lennon.

[[Indo-European people]]

CATEGORIES: Indo-European

Indo-Europeans are those who lived in eastern Europe and central Asia thousands of years ago. They descended from the Ukrainian steppes, and spread out across Europe, western Asia, central Asia, and India.

Indo-Europeans are Bronze Age-speakers of Indo-European languages that had not yet split into language families we know today, like Centum and Satem dialects (speakers of languages predating Proto-Indo-Iranian, Proto-Greek, Proto-Celtic, Proto-Italic, Proto-Germanic, Proto-Balto-Slavic etc.)

Speakers of Indo-European languages in historical times and nowadays often are not called by the name Indo-Europeans but with often by the name of their language family like: Anatolians, Tocharians, Aryans (Iranians, Indo-Aryans), Greeks, Celts, Italic peoples, Germanic peoples, Baltic peoples, Slavic peoples, Armenians, Albanians (or subdivisions of these groups).

[[Urban area]]

CATEGORIES: Urban planning, Urban design, Economic geography

An urban area is an area where many people live and work close together. The population density is higher than in the surrounding area.  It is where buildings are close together. Urban is the opposite of rural, where farm lands and nature are. Urban areas are usually cities and towns.  Most of the work available in urban areas is factory and office work. Agricultural work is rare because buildings are close together and there is no space for farm lands. 

There are different urban area definitions for each country. The definitions mostly depend on how populated the country is and if the definition shows a true percentage of how urbanized the country is. For example, in Poland an urban area is any place that has the status of a town, whereas in China it is any district, city, or town with a population density higher than 1500 people per square kilometer. The urban population definition for Canadian and Scandinavian countries depends on density.  If there is a house every 200 meters it is classified as urban.

A large urban area, with all connected areas (usually developed around some city) is called a Metropolitan area.

[[Mary Hopkin]]

CATEGORIES: 1950 births, Living people, British folk musicians, Musicians from Glamorgan, Welsh singers

Mary Hopkin (born 3 May 1950) is a Welsh folk singer. She was born in Pontardawe. She was most famous in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Her first and biggest hit was "Those Were The Days" in 1968.

When The Beatles started their own record label called Apple Records, they were looking for new artists to sign up. Model Twiggy, a friend of the band, recommended her. After Hopkin signed with Apple, Beatle Paul McCartney produced many of the songs for her first album, called Post Card. Singer-songwriters Donovan and Harry Nilsson, and record producer George Martin, also gave her songs to record.

"Those Were The Days" was McCartney's choice for Hopkin's first single. He chose well, and the song became a hit worldwide. Hopkin recorded other singles, including "Goodbye", "Temma Harbour", "Knock, Knock, Who's There", and a remake of Doris Day's "Qué Sera, Sera", but they were not as successful as her first record. McCartney moved on to a solo career after the Beatles disbanded, and no longer worked with her. Hopkin's second album, Earth Song/Ocean Song, was largely self-produced.

Hopkin disliked the way Apple Records had promoted her, as a kind of "squeaky-clean" schoolgirl. She left the label after two albums and a best-ofs compilation, also titled Those Were the Days. She retired from music after marrying producer Tony Visconti, but she did appear as a background singer on a few of his productions.

During the 1990s, Apple Records reissued many of their old records, including Hopkin's two original albums. She oversaw a new version of Those Were the Days, with bonus tracks and a detailed booklet.

Thomas "Tom" Evans (5 June 1947 – 19 November 1983) was an English guitarist and songwriter, who had several hit records as a member of Badfinger, during the late 1960s and early 1970s. He was also the cowriter of "Without You", with collaborator Peter Ham, another member of Badfinger.

Evans and Ham wrote most of Badfinger's hits together, including "No Matter What", "Day After Day", and "Baby Blue", which appeared on Apple Records. After leaving Apple, Badfinger's fortunes dipped. Ham committed suicide by hanging in 1975. Evans was devastated, and never got over losing his musical partner. He also hanged himself, in London in 1983.

"Without You" first became a hit in a cover version by Harry Nilsson in 1971, and the song became a standard as time went on. Badfinger's music was mostly forgotten by the 1980s, but became popular again in the 1990s when their old records appeared on compact disc.

[[Solon]]

CATEGORIES: Ancient Greece

Solon was a statesman in Ancient Greece. He is one of Seven Sages (or Wise Men) of Greece, because of his political reforms to the laws of Athens. Many of these changes helped the poor people. He lived from 630 B.C.- 560 B.C. He introduced the court and judges. About 594 B.C., the nobles elected Solon to lead Athens. He made reforms that helped prevent a revolt by the poor. First he freed people who had become slaves because of debts. He made a law that no citizen could be enslaved. Solon also organized citizens into four classes based on wealth, not birth. Rich men had more power. Yet this was still a more fair system than the old one that limited power to nobles. Solon allowed all citizens to serve in the assembly and help elect leaders. He also reformed the laws to make them less harsh.

[[Visa]]

CATEGORIES: Travel, Identification documents

A visa  (short for the Latin carta visa, lit. "the document having been seen") is a permit given by a country that allows someone to go to that country. A visa is a document that is stamped on a person's passport by an embassy. It names the kind of visit and says how long the person can stay. Sometimes, people need to go through an interview held at the embassy before they get a visa.

Many countries require foreign visitors to have a valid passport and a visa before they can enter the country, but there are exceptions (see below for examples of such these).

Visas are associated with the request for permission to enter (or exit) a country, and are thus, for some countries, not the same as actual formal permission for an alien to enter and remain in the country.

Some countries, such as some states of the former Soviet Union, require that their citizens, and sometimes foreign travelers, obtain an exit visa in order to be allowed to leave the country. Until 2004, foreign students in Russia were issued only an entry visa on being accepted to University there, and had to obtain an exit visa to return home.  This policy has since been changed, and foreign students are now issued multiple entry (and exit) visa.

[[Angles]]

CATEGORIES: Germanic tribes, Anglo-Saxons, German people, Schleswig-Holstein

The Angles were a Germanic people of unknown origin. Their name seems to be connected with Angeln, a modern district in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. The Angles, together with the Jutes, Saxons and Frisians, were among the Germanic tribes who sailed across the North Sea in the 5th century to invade Britain. The various tribes were later called "Anglo-Saxon".

[[Angeln]]

CATEGORIES: Geography of Schleswig-Holstein, Regions of Germany

Modern Angeln, (Danish: Angel; Latin: Anglia, which also means in direct translation from Latin: England), is a peninsula in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. 

Ancient Angeln may have been somewhat larger than the Angeln of today, but following the ancient sources it included the territory of modern Angeln.

Angeln has an importance far beyond its small area, as it seems to have been the original home of the Angles who invaded the southern part of Great Britain, which was named after them, England. And so the name of the major world language, English, seems to have taken its name from this little region.

Following the departure of the Angles from Anglia about 350, the region was occupied by Danish settlers not later than the 8th century.

[[Vampire bat]]

CATEGORIES: Bats

Vampire bats is a subfamily of bats. Unlike other bats, vampire bats feed on blood. Currently, there are three species of bats known to do this. All of them live in the Americas, in Mexico, Brazil, Chile and Argentina. Of the three known species, one feeds on the blood of mammals, the other two on the blood of birds.

The common vampire bat lives in large groups, of up to 100 animals. They have developed complex social behaviour. 

Vampire bats commonly spread diseases, most notably rabies. The saliva of the vampire bats contain chemicals that prevent the clotting of the blood of the victim; this has been used to develop drugs to help the patients of strokes and heart attacks.

The false vampire bats are not vampire bats; they do not feed on blood, some eat fruits, others devour small animals.

Vampires may be modelled on bats.

[[Domesday Book]]

CATEGORIES: 1086 books, History of the British Isles

The Domesday Book is the record of the great survey of much of England, and parts of Wales, completed in 1086, done for William I of England, or William the Conqueror.  

The Domesday Book (also known as Domesday, or Book of Winchester) was a record of all taxable land in England, together with such information as would indicate its worth. 

As the scribes went round England, they were protected by William's armed men. Each group was led by a Royal Commissioner, who took a list of standard questions. A 'jury' of local nobility and citizens answered the questions. All answers were written down in Latin.

Information was collected from the start of 1086, and working up into the complete volume started later that year. William died in 1087 before the writing-up work was completed.

William the Conqueror wished to know the details of the land he had conquered, England. He let his knights and barons have big areas of land, and wanted rent money from them. The Domesday Book was a record of every farm, village and house so that he knew how much rent he should get. Only some small villages in the countryside are not in the book. Major cities like London and Winchester are also not in the Domesday Book, perhaps because of their size, or because (not owning land), the people could not be taxed. 

The Domesday book gave the names of King William's friends and even listed the number of pigs on a piece of land. But it was not like a modern census. It did not give the names of all the people. It listed the heads of each household, but left out Londoners, monks, nuns, and anyone living in castles. In effect, it listed only people he could get rent from, and who might supply men to fight in his army.

[[LD50]]

CATEGORIES: Toxicology

The name LD50 is an abbreviation for "Lethal Dose, 50%" or median lethal dose. It is the amount of the substance required (usually per body weight) to kill 50% of the test population.

The test was created by J.W. Trevan in 1927 but has been phased out. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has begun to approve non-animal alternatives to LD50, in response to research cruelty concerns and the lack of validity/sensitivity of animal tests as they relate to humans.

Modern Talking's first period of activity was from 1984 to 1987. The duo reunified in 1998 and made a successful comeback, releasing more music from 1998 to 2003. Modern Talking's sound, however, was rather different from its original 1980s sound after its reunion. The duo came back in 1998 recording their materials based on what the demand was in central European music markets at the time in the late 1990s, which required their original 1980s mellow Europop sound to switch into 1990s up-tempo Eurodance. The duo released singles which again entered the top-10 not only in their home country but also abroad. Some of those singles were "You're My Heart, You're My Soul '98", "Brother Louie '98", and "You Are Not Alone".

[[History of Taiwan]]

CATEGORIES: History of Taiwan

Taiwan (minus the Pescadores) is an island of eastern Asia. Its first people were related to Oceanic people with small numbers of Chinese. After the arrival of the Dutch in the 1600s, many Chinese moved to Taiwan to work. Few European people moved to Taiwan, and the native people married with Chinese or moved away from the west side of the island. When the Qing dynasty began in China, a supporter of the old Ming dynasty hid in Taiwan. Eventually the Qing came to Taiwan, defeated him, and added Taiwan to China.  

Taiwan remained Chinese territory through most of the Qing dynasty until it was taken by Japan in 1895. Taiwan became a colony of Japan for fifty years until the end of World War Two. For a brief time it was under the control of China through the Guomindang government, but that government lost a civil war and moved to Taiwan. The rule of the Guomindang is considered controversial today. Some criticize its treatment of the people of Taiwan, but others focus on positive political and economic change that it made. 

In the 1980s, the government became more democratic. This has also been controversial because it allows different political parties to compete. The Democratic Progressive Party gained influence. During this time, Taiwan has officially been called the Republic of China but has acted independently of China. The People's Republic of China demands that Taiwan must become a part of China, while most Taiwanese debate the appropriate political status for today. These perspectives make complications in the politics of Taiwan.

[[Fret]]

CATEGORIES: String instrument construction

A fret is a thin strip of varying materials (most commonly metal, but occasionally gut or nylon) found on string instruments. Guitars, mandolins, and banjos have frets.

Frets are mounted on the long necks of the instrument. The frets help the musician playing the instrument to know where to place their fingers on the instrument.

On historical instruments and some non-European instruments, pieces of string tied around the neck are frets.

Frets divide the neck into sections related to a musical framework. On instruments such as guitars, each fret marks one semitone in the standard western system where one octave is divided into twelve semitones.

[[Amplifier]]

CATEGORIES: Electronic musical instruments, Electronics, Audio technology

The word amplifier (sometimes called an amp) usually refers to an electronic amplifier. Electronic amplifiers make a signal from a radio or electric musical instrument (such as an electric guitar or an electric bass guitar) louder and stronger. Amplifiers are also hidden in any electronic thing that makes sound with loudspeakers. This includes televisions, radios, computers, and mp3 players, to name a few.

Amplifiers ability to use low impedance speakers may vary. Typical impedance is 8 ohms.

Classification can be done by current loss when amplifier is on but does not get signal. Example: A-class amplifier takes more current without signal than B-class amplifier but A-class amplifier have smaller distortion.

There is also several distortion types.

[[Hegemony]]

CATEGORIES: Politics

Hegemony (pronounced with a soft or hard g) is the power of one group over other groups. Hegemony is mostly used to refer to relationships between different nations (or countries). This might be direct dominance, such as through military might, but may be indirect dominance, such as when a nation can dictate the terms of trade to its advantage.

Hegemony often describes the relationship of a great power to nearby less powerful countries.  The term is Greek, and was first used about the influence of a great city over the cities which were allied to it.  Examples are the  Peloponnesian League of Sparta (6th to 4th centuries BC); the short-lived Delian League of Classical Athens.  The later League of Corinth was headed not by a state, but by Philip II of Macedon.  Such a hegemon is a king or ruler with personal power.

A hegemonic relationship is usually described as less than an empire, but more than a regional power. This means a hegemon may not actually take control of other nations, but has the power to greatly influence what they do.  On the other hand, a global hegemon is more powerful than, say, Iran is in the Middle East.

Leonard James "Jim" Callaghan, Baron Callaghan of Cardiff, true (ˈ; 27 March 1912 – 26 March 2005) was a British Labour politician who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom (UK) from 1976 to 1979.

Born in the 1910s, Callaghan was an old-style socialist, lacking any higher education, and served as Member of Parliament (MP) for a Cardiff constituency. He is the only person to have held all three leading UK Cabinet positions (Chancellor, Home Secretary and Foreign Secretary), prior to their premiership. He was never expected to reach the premiership, having taken a back seat to the younger and more charismatic Harold Wilson for many years. However, when Wilson unexpectedly announced his retirement in 1976, Callaghan was the most experienced candidate to replace him. His time as prime minister was one of more open government but the electorate was dissatisfied with his relaxed response to high inflation and more industrial unrest, and replaced Labour with a Conservative government under Margaret Thatcher.

Callaghan resigned as Leader of the Labour Party shortly afterwards, but remained an MP for some years before being sent to the House of Lords as Baron Callaghan of Cardiff.

His authoritarian government during this time caused opposition despite his attempt to placate critics with a 'show' election in 1954 were he ran without opposition. The opposition included the entire coalition that had overthrown President Gerardo Machado. Fidel Castro's guerrilla movement overthrew Batista. This is known as the Cuban Revolution. Batista fled Cuba on January 1, 1959 and went to the Dominican Republic before moving on to Portugal, and finally to Spain where he died of a heart attack in 1973.

[[Special effect]]

CATEGORIES: Movie production, Television, Arts, Technology

Special effects are used in movies to create images that do not exist. There are many different types of special effects, for example, making little models or using computer animation.

Action movies often use special effects to create images that would be dangerous or cost a lot of money. For example, if an action movie shows a very big battleship blowing up, it would be expensive to buy a battleship and dangerous to blow it up. Most action movies use special effects if they want to show something blow up. It is cheaper and safer to make a little model of a battleship and blow that up. 

Science fiction, fantasy, and horror movies also often use special effects. They usually tell imaginary stories, often set in imaginary places, that would be impossible to film. For example, in a science fiction movie about a world with three suns, artists could create a computer image of three suns which would appear in the background. 

Using a computer to create special effects is called "computer generated imagery" (CGI) or "computer animation". Most science fiction movies from the 2000s use a lot of CGI.

Armorica or Aremorica is the name given in ancient times to the part of Gaul that includes the Brittany peninsula and the territory between the Seine and Loire rivers

[[Gaul]]

CATEGORIES: History of Europe, Former countries in Europe

Gaul (Gallia) was the name given in ancient times to the area of Western Europe that included northern Italy, France, Belgium, western Switzerland and the parts of the Netherlands and Germany on the west bank of the Rhine river. Many Celtic tribes lived in the region and were known by the Romans simply as "Gauls". 

In English, the word Gaul (Gaulois) may also mean a Celtic inhabitant of that region, although the expression may be used for all ancient speakers of the Gaulish language as well.  In this way, "Gaul" and "Celt" are sometimes used in the same sense.

Gauls under Brennus attacked Rome with the Battle of the Allia (390 BC).

[[Danelaw]]

CATEGORIES: History of England, History of Denmark

The Danelaw (from the Old English Dena lagu, Danish: Danelagen ) is an 11th-century name for an area of northern and eastern England. This area was under the administrative control of the Danish Viking empire (or Danes, or Norsemen) from the late 9th century until the early 11th century.

As can be seen from the map, Danelaw at its height was about a third the territory of England. Textbooks say correctly that the history left us with place-names which reflect the old languages.

[[Jorvik]]

CATEGORIES: History of the British Isles

Jórvík was the Viking name for the English city of York and the kingdom centred there.

[[Mutton]]

CATEGORIES: Meat

The terms lamb, mutton  or hoggett are used to describe the meat of a domestic sheep.  The meat of a sheep a year old or younger is generally known as lamb, whereas the meat of an older sheep is either hoggett or mutton depending on its age and characteristics.  In some countries all such meat is referred to as lamb.  All of these are known as sheepmeats.

The meat of a lamb is taken from the animal between one month and one year old, with a weight of between 5.5 and 30 kilograms.  This meat generally is more tender than that from older sheep and is often eaten more often in some western countries, most often on Easter.

Hoggett and mutton can taste more flavorful than lamb because they contain a higher concentration of species-characteristic fatty acids; many therefore prefer the stronger flavour of older animals. 

[[Prion]]

CATEGORIES: Biochemistry

A prion is an infectious protein. The word is short for "proteinaceous infectious particles". 

All known prion diseases in mammals affect the structure of the brain or other neural tissue. Right now, they cannot be treated and always end in death.

Prions cause many forms of encephalitis, or brain disease, such as scrapie, Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease  (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy) and kuru. Prions work by changing the shape of proteins in the infected animals. While normal proteins have lots of alpha helices, or twisted parts, changed proteins have lots of beta sheets, or flat parts. The word is pronounced pree-on.

Because prions are proteins, and proteins cannot reproduce themselves, it is a mystery how prions work. A lot of molecular biology research is going on to find out how they reproduce themselves, with no clear result so far.

[[Hashish]]

CATEGORIES: Illegal drugs, Cannabis

Hashish is a sticky, thick, dark-colored resin (plant juice) which is made from the flower of the female cannabis plant, Cannabis sativa. The cannabis plant's leaves and flowers contain chemicals known as cannabinoids. One cannabinoid is THC, which gives a person who smokes or eats parts of the cannabis plant a feeling of euphoria (makes the user feel good or happy). Another cannabinoid is CBD, which gives the user a relaxing feeling, and another is CBG which gives the user red or droopy eyes. The name hashish comes from an Arabic word meaning dry weed.

The two main drugs made from the cannabis plant are marijuana and hashish. Hashish has much more of the chemical THC (which makes users feel good or happy) than marijuana.  Hashish is an illegal drug in the United States, UK and many other countries. Some people think it should be legal, some think it should be legal only for medical reasons, and some think it should not be legal at all.

[[Old English]]

CATEGORIES: English language, 5th century establishments in Europe, 11th-century disestablishments, 450s establishments

The Old English language, often called Anglo-Saxon, was spoken in Anglo-Saxon England from 450 AD to 1100 AD. It was spoken by the Anglo-Saxons, who came to Great Britain from what is now Germany and Denmark. Different Anglo-Saxon kingdoms spoke different dialects, but a western dialect became the main literary version. Both modern languages of England and Scotland (English and Scots) came from the language of the Anglo-Saxons.

Old English is very different from Modern English and has many more Germanic words. In early centuries, it was rarely written down and even then was in runes. After the 9th century, the Latin alphabet was used more often. Old English grammar is difficult, with complex inflections, and close to Old German. Latin was used by churchmen like the venerable Bede. Old English gradually turned into Middle English after the Norman Conquest of 1066.

Beowulf is written in Old English in an alphabetic script.

[[Bremerhaven Hauptbahnhof]]

CATEGORIES: 1914 establishments in Europe, 1910s establishments in Germany, Bremen (state), Railway stations in Germany

Bremerhaven Hauptbahnhof is the central railway station in the German city of Bremerhaven, Bremen.

The station lies on the line from Bremen to Cuxhaven. The line from Bremen was built in 1862, and a station for that was built in Geestemünde. At the time, Geestemünde did not belong to Bremerhaven, but was a separate town. The line from Geestemünde to Cuxhaven was then built in 1896. 

Because there were too many trains in the old station and it is connected only with single-track, it was decided to knock down the old station. The new station, which is now Bremerhaven Central railway station, was opened in 1914. Because it still was in Geestemünde, but not as far away as the old station, it was called Geestemünde-Bremerhaven. 

In 1924, some other towns joined Bremerhaven, and the city got a new name, Wesermünde. The station got a new name, Wesermünde-Bremerhaven, because of that.

In 1944, in the middle of World War II, the hall over the railway tracks was destroyed by a bomb that was thrown from an American plane. The hall was not built again after the war.

Wesermünde received another name and was called Bremerhaven from 1947, and the station received the new name too and was now called Bremerhaven Hauptbahnhof. That means "Bremerhaven Central railway station", and it was called that way because it was now in the middle of the new, large city.

Electric cables were put in the station in 1966, so that electric trains could run. Trains that were carrying soldiers of the US Army often ran to Bremerhaven in the 1970s, because the US Army had large barracks in the city.

[[Duchy]]

CATEGORIES: Forms of government

A duchy is a territory or domain ruled by a duke or duchess.  Historically, some duchies in Continental Europe were sovereign, while others (especially in France and Britain) were subordinate districts of a kingdom.

In France, a number of duchies existed in the medieval period. Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom still holds the medieval French title of Duke of Normandy; the only lands still attached to the Duchy of Normandy are the Channel Islands. 

In medieval England, the territories of Lancashire and Cornwall were made duchies, with certain powers given to their Dukes.

The Wars of the Roses (1455–1487) were a series of civil wars fought over the throne of England between supporters of the House of Lancaster, the Lancastrians, and supporters of the House of York, the Yorkists. Both houses were branches of the Plantagenet royal house and were related through King Edward III.

The wars began for several reasons, and historians have debated the one that was most important. King Henry VI was seen as a poor ruler by many of his people because of his lack of interest in politics and his mental illness (his French queen, Margaret of Anjou, often made key decisions instead). Also, England's defeat in the Hundred Years' War in France, money problems after the war and problems with the feudal system of government were other causes.

The name of the Wars of the Roses, which was first used only in the 19th century, comes from the white rose symbol for the House of York and the red rose symbol for the House of Lancaster. However, the red rose symbol was not used until after the wars had ended, and most soldiers fought under the symbol of their local nobleman. At the time, they were called the "Civil Wars". The houses were named after the cities of Lancaster and York, but neither city played a big role during the war, and both houses owned land all over England and Wales.

[[Escherichia coli]]

CATEGORIES: Gram-negative bacteria, Model organisms

Escherichia coli or E. coli is a bacterium that lives in the intestines of people and other warm-blooded animals. Scientists have studied E. coli a lot, and know more about how E. coli cells work than any other organism. E. coli is usually not harmful. In fact, the only known harmful strain is O157. E.coli is a prokaryotic organism.

E. coli normally grow in soil and in the large intestines of many mammals, including humans. Most strains of E. coli do not cause disease, but instead help animals get vitamins and digest food. Some strains of E. coli cause sickness in people. E. coli are not usually in food or water. When food has not been prepared with clean equipment, E. coli can grow in the food. When E. coli are found in water, this may mean that the water has touched sewage. 

It is named after Theodor Escherich, who discovered it in 1885. It was officially named after him in 1919.

[[Hemoglobin]]

CATEGORIES: Proteins, Iron compounds, Blood

Hemoglobin (or haemoglobin) is a protein in red blood cells which contains iron. It is used to transport oxygen around the human body. Hemoglobin is found in the red blood cells of all vertebrates apart from white-blooded fish. It also occurs in some invertebrates. Some invertebrates use other chemicals such as hemocyanin

Hemoglobin is involved in the transport of other gases. It carries some of the body's respiratory carbon dioxide (about 20-25% of the total). 

Red blood cells get their colour from hemoglobin, which is red. There are millions of hemoglobin molecules in each red blood cell and millions of red blood cells in the human body. When hemoglobin has oxygen attached, it is called oxyhemoglobin.

[[Cornea]]

CATEGORIES: Eye anatomy

The cornea is the front part of the eye. It is the clear transparent section of the eye. The cornea covers the iris, pupil, and the eye chamber. It is a special form of tissue. The cornea is clear and has no blood vessels. It has nerves, but with no myelin sheaths on them.

The cornea, with the lens, refracts light. The cornea and the lens bend light so the image strikes the retina. The cornea does about two-thirds of this refraction.

Dua's layer is a newly discovered layer of the cornea. It was described in June 2013. It is the sixth layer of the cornea to be discovered. Despite its thinness, the layer is very strong, and air does not get through it.

[[Evangelicalism]]

CATEGORIES: Evangelicalism

The word evangelicalism refers to a type of Christian belief and practice in conservative Protestant Christianity, although some Catholic Christians would also call themselves evangelicals.

Evangelicals believe in spreading their faith, (evangelism), the need to be converted, also called being born again, believing what is in the Bible and the need to live a moral life both personally and in society.  In the past 200 years, people, churches and social movements have often been called evangelical.  This is different from Protestant liberalism although they may share some of the same goals.

Outside the United States, the word evangelical can mean different things. In Europe and Latin America the word evangelical is often used to simply mean Protestant, as different from Roman Catholic religion. Some Christian denominations have the word evangelical as part of their official name.  This may indicate that they are more conservative than other denominations with a similar name.

In 2016, there were thought to be about 619 million evangelicals in the world, meaning that one in four Christians would be an evangelical. The United States has many evangelicals. American evangelicals are about one fourth of the nation's population and its largest religious group. There are also many evangelicals in Latin America, Africa, China and Korea. Evangelicals make up most of the  Baptist churches, Pentecostals, a portion of Methodists, Presbyterians and other older denominations, and many independent Christian churches that do not belong to any larger group.

Billy Graham was probably the best known evangelical of the last 100 years. He preached all around the world.
