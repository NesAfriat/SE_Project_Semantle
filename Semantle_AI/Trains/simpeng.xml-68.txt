[[Batting (cricket)]]

CATEGORIES: Cricket

In the sport of cricket, batting is the act or skill of hitting the cricket ball with a cricket bat. It is done to score runs or prevent the loss of one's wicket. 

Any player who is currently batting is called a batsman even if they are better in any other skills in cricket. Batsmen have to adapt to various conditions when playing on different cricket pitches, especially in different countries. A top-level batsman has good reflexes, decision-making and strategy with excellent physical batting skills.

During an innings two members of the batting side are on the pitch. The one facing the current delivery from the bowler is called 'the striker', while the other is the non-striker. When a batsman is out, he is replaced by a teammate. This continues until the end of the innings or until 10 of the team members are out. After the batting of first team is over the other team gets a turn to bat.

Batting tactics and strategy depends on the type of match being played. It also depends on the current state of play. Batsmen try to score many runs quickly without losing their wicket. To score quickly, risky shots must be played which increases the chances of batsman being out. Batsman's safest choice is to guard  the stumps but this may result in scoring fewer runs.

As with all other cricket statistics, batting statistics and records are given much attention. It helps to know how effectively a batsman is playing. The main statistic for batting is a player's batting average. This is calculated by dividing the number of runs he has scored by the number of times he has been out (dismissed).

[[Slighting]]

CATEGORIES: Fortification

Slighting is the deliberate damage of an important building. In the Middle Ages, castles were slighted during war. Rich and powerful people built and owned castles, and were proud of them. A king or queen could use slighting as a way to punish people who rebelled against them. Sometimes the owner feared they would lose the castle in an attack, and broke parts of the castle so that it would not be useful to other people. Occasionally, a king or queen might order someone to dismantle their own castle if they did not get permission to build it.

Castles were sometimes repaired after they were slighted, while others were abandoned. Many famous castles like Corfe or Kenilworth are ruins because they were slighted during the English Civil War.

Before his death, Wells was a pizza delivery man who, shortly before his death, made a delivery stop outside of Erie.

Investigated by a task force led by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, it was described as "one of the most complicated and bizarre crimes in the annals of the FBI". The Wells story was the subject of significant attention in the mass media. The question of whether Wells was a victim or a mastermind behind the robbery plot is debated.

Two of his alleged co-conspirators, Marjorie Diehl-Armstrong and Kenneth Barnes, were indicted. In 2008, U.S. District Judge Sean J. McLaughlin sentenced Barnes to 45 years in federal prison.

Gloria Ramirez (January 11, 1963 – February 19, 1994) was an American woman dubbed "the Toxic Lady" by the media when several hospital workers became ill after exposure to her body and blood. She was from Riverside, California.

Ramirez had been admitted to the ER while suffering from late-stage cervical cancer. While treating Ramirez, several hospital workers fainted and others experienced symptoms such as shortness of breath and muscle spasms.

Five workers required hospitalization, one of whom remained in intensive care unit  for two weeks. 

Shortly after arriving at the hospital, Ramirez died from complications related to cancer. The incident was initially thought to be a case of mass hysteria. 

The medical staff injected her with diazepam, midazolam, and lorazepam to sedate her. When it became clear that Ramirez was responding poorly to treatment, the staff tried to defibrillate her heart. Many people saw an oily substance covering Ramirez's body. Others noted a fruity, garlic-like odor that they thought was coming from her mouth.

An investigation by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory said that Ramirez had been self-injecting dimethyl sulfoxide as a treatment for pain, which converted into dimethyl sulfate, an extremely poisonous agent via a series of chemical reactions in the emergency department. Although the medical sector of Riverside supports this claim, scientists still believe it is not the case.

Two months after Ramirez died, her badly decomposed body was released for an independent autopsy and burial. On April 20, 1994—ten weeks after her death—Ramirez was buried at Olivewood Memorial Park in Riverside.

General elections were held in Pakistan on 25 July 2018 to elect the members of the 15th National Assembly and to the four Provincial Assemblies of Pakistan.  

Most of the opinion polls suggested an overall Pakistan Muslim League (N) lead with Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) being the close second. Many people are believing that the Pakistani courts and military are rigging the votes in favor of the PTI and against the PML (N).

Pakistan Tahreek e Insaaf party leader Imran Khan leads in early poll results despite calls of corruption. The allegations were denied by the Election Commission of Pakistan.

On July 27, election officials declared that Khan's party had won 109 of the 269 seats, giving PTI a majority in the National Assembly thus making Khan Prime Minister-elect. On August 15, Asad Qaiser elected as Speaker of the National Assembly of Pakistan and Qasim Suri as Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly of Pakistan.

[[Coral bleaching]]

CATEGORIES: Ecology

Coral bleaching occurs when stony corals turn white.

Stony corals are simple animals that form large reefs. The animals live in a endosymbiotic relationship with single-celled algae. To get sunlight the corals live just below sea level. The algae make food products for the coral polyp by photosynthesis.

Coral polyps are sensitive to changes in their environment. This includes the temperature of the water they live in. Under stress, coral polyps may expel the algae which live inside their tissues. The algae provide up to 90% of the coral's energy.  Bleached corals continue to live but begin to starve after bleaching. Some corals recover.

Warmer sea water temperatures caused by global warming is the leading cause of coral bleaching.

The United Nations Environment Programme says that the longest recorded global bleaching events happened between 2014 and 2016.  Coral was killed on an unprecedented scale. In 2016, bleaching of coral on the Great Barrier Reef killed between 29 and 50 percent of the reef's coral. 

In 2017, the bleaching got into the central region of the reef. The interval between bleaching events has halved between 1980 and 2016.

Recent research showed that the coral-algae relationship is much older than was thought. This suggests it has survived many climate changes.

Some corals change color instead of turning white when they are bleached.  The colors can be very bright.  In May 2020, scientists from the University of Southampton said that the colors act like sunscreen and protect the coral cells from light.  The scientists said this means some corals can lose their algae for a while and might have developed bright colors as a way to make it easier for the algae to come back and to stay alive until then.

Alan Gabriel Ludwig García Pérez (ˈalaŋ ɡaβˈɾjel luðˈwiɣ ɡarˈsi.a; 23 May 1949 – 17 April 2019) was a Peruvian politician. He was the President of Peru from 1985 to 1990 and again from 2006 to 2011. He was the leader of the Peruvian Aprista Party.

His first term, the country went through a severe economic crisis, social unrest and violence. He ran unsuccessfully for the Presidency in 2001, losing in a run-off to Alejandro Toledo. He ran again in 2006 and was elected to a second term, even though his first term in the 1980s was thought to be the worst in the country's history.

During García's second term, Peru had increased environmental damage, according to critics, and increased social conflict, according to the national human rights ombudsman's office.

García ran for a third term as president in the 2016 Peruvian general election as the candidate of the criticized Popular Alliance coalition which included APRA’s old rival, the Christian People’s Party with Lourdes Flores as his first running mate. The election's first round polls gave García 5.83% of the popular vote, preventing him from participating in the runoff election. Pedro Pablo Kuczynski was ultimately elected.

On the morning of 17 April 2019, García shot himself in the neck when police officials were planning to arrest him linked to a corruption scandal. He was hospitalized under critical condition and had emergency surgery where García had three cardiac arrests. He died hours later at a Lima hospital.  García became the second head of state of Peru to die of suicide after Gustavo Jiménez, who did so in 1933.

García is considered one of the most controversial yet talented politicians of Peru's contemporary history. He was known as an immensely charismatic orator.

Ollanta Moisés Humala Tasso (oˈʎanta uˈmala; born 27 June 1962) is a Peruvian politician. He was the 65th President of Peru from 2011 to 2016. Humala lost the 2006 presidential election and eventually won the 2011 presidential election in a run-off vote. He was elected as President of Peru in the second round, defeating Keiko Fujimori (daughter of former President Alberto Fujimori).

Born to a prominent political family affiliated with the ethnocacerist movement, Humala is the son of famed Quechua labour lawyer Isaac Humala. Humala entered the Peruvian Army in 1981, eventually achieveing the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. During his time in the military, he fought in the internal conflict against far-left terrorist group Shining Path as well as in the Cenepa War with neighboring Ecuador. In October 2000, Humala attempted an unsuccessful coup d'etatagainst President Alberto Fujimori during the dying days of his regime; eventually, Congress granted him amnesty and Humala was allowed to return to military duty.

In 2005, Humala entered electoral politics, founding the Peruvian Nationalist Party (PNP) in order to run in the 2006 presidential election. Having received first place in the first round, he faced former centre-left President and APRA candidate Alan García in the second round, ultimately losing by a narrow margin. His campaign received widespread international attention in 2006 given the recent success of left-wing politicians in Latin America. In 2011, he would once again run for President, and narrowly defeated Keiko Fujimori in the runoff.

Humala's election initially concerned investors, who feared he would govern similar to far-left Venezuelan PresidentHugo Chavez, a former ally of his. To assuage these fears, Humala would begin his term by choosing centrists for positions in his cabinet. Humala's unpopular presidency was dominated by corruption scandals surrounding him and his politically influential wife Nadine Heredia. Environmentalists were highly critical of Humala's mining policies, and argued that he reneged on his campaign promise to reign in mining companies.

Humala was arrested by Peruvian authorities in July 2017 for illegally accepting bribes and awaits a corruption trial.

Humala ran for president again in 2021, but lost in the first round of the election.

Gary Dwayne Payton Sr. (born July 23, 1968 in Oakland, California) is an American retired professional basketball player. He started at the point guard position. He is best known for his 13-year time with the Seattle SuperSonics, and holds Seattle franchise records in points, assists, and steals. He also played with the Milwaukee Bucks, Los Angeles Lakers, Boston Celtics and Miami Heat, the last with whom he won an NBA championship. He was nicknamed "The Glove" by his cousin during the 1993 Western Conference Finals against the Phoenix Suns when he held his opponent Kevin Johnson defensively "like a glove" on the court.  He was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame on September 8, 2013.  Payton is considered by many to be the greatest defensive guard of all time and one of the greatest defenders in basketball history.  He used his quick feet in order to master the art of staying in front of his opponent on defense.  He was also one of the best at guarding Michael Jordan, although in the 1996 NBA Finals the Sonics largely used Hersey Hawkins to guard Jordan.  Payton's best teammate for many years was All-Star Shawn Kemp, and the Sonics had many deep playoff runs including playing in the 1996 NBA Finals.

Payton is widely considered one of the best point guards of all time and is the only point guard who has won the NBA Defensive Player of the Year award, which he won in 1996. He was selected to the NBA All-Defensive First Team nine times, an NBA record he shares with Michael Jordan, Kevin Garnett and Kobe Bryant. He was also a nine-time NBA All-Star and a nine-time All-NBA Team member.

Payton ranks fourth in steals, eighth in assists and 32nd in points among the NBA's career leaders.  Payton is also considered one of the greatest college basketball players of all time and ranks among all-time leaders in assists and steals.

Payton is also known by the much lesser used nickname GP, an initialism for his first and last name, which he even at one point had as a license plate.  One of his sons, Gary Payton II, has played in the NBA as well.

CATEGORIES: Logical paradoxes

Sorites paradox (also called Paradox of the heap) is a paradox that arises when unclear terms are used. The name of the paradox is related to the Greek word for heap ('soros'). There are different versions, but a typical one involves a heap of sand. The heap is made of many grains of sand. So if one grain is removed, the structure will still be a heap. This process can be repeated, until only one grain of sand is left. Since the heap never changed to a non-heap, this grain of sand is still a heap.

The paradox works the other way as well. If one begins with one grain of sand and adds another, and then another; when do the grains of sand become a heap?

CATEGORIES: 1800s in Europe, Wars

The Fourth Coalition fought in a war against Napoleon's French Empire from 1806–1807. The coalition was defeated.

Countries in the Coalition included Prussia, Russia, Saxony, Sweden, and Great Britain. Several members of the coalition had previously been fighting France in the Third Coalition, and there wasn't any peace in between wars. On October 9, 1806, Prussia joined a new coalition, fearing that France was becoming more powerful after it defeated Austria and established the Confederation of the Rhine. Prussia and Russia prepared for a new campaign. Prussian troops moved to Saxony.

On 14 October 1806, the French defeated the Prussian army at the Battle of Jena-Auerstadt.  Then French forces occupied Prussia and captured Berlin. Later they advanced towards Poland and Russia. On 7-8 February 1807, the French and Russian armies fought the Battle of Eylau. There was no clear winner. On 14 June 1807, the French defeated the Russians at the Battle of Friedland. In July 1807, France made peace with Russia, ending the war. This left Napoleon as ruler of most of western and central Europe. The exceptions were Spain, Portugal, Austria, and a few smaller states. These were able to remain independent. 

Even though the Fourth Coalition came to an end, Britain remained at war with France.

Altair is an A-type main sequence star with an apparent visual magnitude of 0.77. It is one of the vertices of the  Summer Triangle (the other two vertices are Deneb and Vega). It is 16.7 light-years (5.13 parsecs) from the Sun and is one of the closest stars visible to the naked eye.

A study with the Palomar Testbed Interferometer showed that Altair is not spherical, but is flattened at the poles due to its high rate of rotation. Other interferometric studies with multiple telescopes, operating in the infrared, have confirmed this.

On August 1, 2007, during the evening rush hour, a major failure caused the bridge to fall down. The bridge collapse killed 13 people and injuried at least 145 more people. The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board said a problem with the design probably caused the bridge to fall. They said a too-thin steel plate ripped along a line of rivets. Also, additional weight at the time due to ongoing rehabilitation construction led to the major failure that caused the bridge to fall into the Mississippi River. It later was replaced with the I-35W Saint Anthony Falls Bridge which opened in September 2008. The new bridge that opened in 2008 carries 10 lanes.

[[Phantom smell]]

CATEGORIES: Symptoms

A phantom smell or olfactory hallucination  is smelling an odor that is not actually there. It is also called phantosmia. It can occur in one nostril or both. Phantosmia with unpleasant smells, which is called cacosmia, is more common. It is often described as smelling something that is burned, foul, spoiled, or rotten. Experiencing phantom smells from time to time is normal and usually goes away on its own. When hallucinations of this type do not seem to go away or when they keep coming back, this can be very upsetting and can lower an individual's quality of life.

Common medical conditions such as nasal infections, nasal polyps, or dental problems can cause phantom smells. A phantom smell can also result from neurological conditions such as migraines, head injuries, strokes, Parkinson's disease, seizures, or brain tumors. It can also be a symptom of certain mental disorders such as depression, bipolar disorder, intoxication or withdrawal from  drugs and alcohol, or psychotic disorders. Certain substances in the environment can also cause phantom smells. These include tobacco smoke, certain types of chemicals (e.g., insecticides or solvents), or radiation treatment for head or neck cancer.

A physician can determine if the problem is with the sense of smell (olfactory system) or taste (gustatory system), or if it is caused by a neurological or psychiatric disorder. Phantosmia usually goes away on its own. Sometimes this occurs step by step. The process can take several years. When a phantom smell is caused by an illness (e.g., sinusitis), it should go away with theillness. If the problem persists or causes significant discomfort, a doctor might recommend nasal saline drops, antidepressant or anticonvulsant medications, anesthesia to parts of the nose, or in very rare circumstances, surgical procedures to remove the olfactory nerves or bulbs.

[[Nipple discharge]]

CATEGORIES: Breasts

Nipple discharge is fluid that comes out of the nipple of the breast but is not caused by pregnancy or breastfeeding. The discharge can be different colors. It can be thick or thin. Nipple discharge can come from one breast or both. Nipple discharge in men is not normal. Ninety-seven percent of the time, nipple discharge is not cancer. 

Sometimes discharge from nipples will get better and not need treatment. Most of the time nipple discharge is not cancer. Once in a while it can be a sign of breast cancer. Newborn babies can have nipple discharge. This is because hormones from the mother cause milk to develop in the baby. This kind of discharge goes away in 2 weeks.

Here are some of the reasons for nipple discharge:

Some medications can cause nipple discharge. These medicines are opioids, oral contraceptives, antihypertensives (methyldopa, reserpine, verapamil), antidepressants and antipsychotics. A woman is more likely to have changes in her breasts as she gets older. Some of these changes can be the cause of nipple discharge.

A doctor or nurse will often ask a woman to have a examination. Medical tests can find the reason for the nipple discharge. A mammogram and ultrasound are two tests that a doctor might use. The fluid that comes out of the nipple may be collected and tested.

Sometimes nipple discharge is treated with an operation. Even after surgery another operation may be needed.

[[Pantry]]

CATEGORIES: Rooms

A pantry is a room where food and other household goods may be stored for a while.

Some food, such as butter, eggs, milk, and such need to be kept cool. Before modern refrigeration was available, there was the pantry. The pantry was a room or large cupboard made to keep cooler than the temperature in the kitchen. Built on the north side of the house close to the kitchen, it had no windows, but had air ventilation. The walls were brick or wood. As the air in the pantry warmed, it rose, escaping through the upper vent.  This in turn drew cooler air in from the lower vent, providing constant circulation of cooler air.  

In the summertime, the temperatures in the pantry would be several degrees lower than the ambient temperature in the house. In wintertime, the temperature in the cold pantry would be considerably lower than that in the kitchen.

A pantry was the place to keep foodstocks that did not need to be kept refrigerated. Remember, food was bought regularly in those days, and not stored for long. Breads, butter, cheesecakes, eggs, pastries, and pies were  kept in a cold.  Vegetables could be brought up from the cellar in smaller amounts and stored in the cold pantry until ready to use. The pantry was a place to store fresh berries and fruit, cheese, butter and such.

CATEGORIES: Hominins

The Denisovans or Denisova hominins are  archaic humans in the genus Homo. They may be an extinct species or subspecies.

They were first discovered in March 2010 in the Denisova Cave in the Altai Mountains in Siberia. This cave that has also been inhabited by Neanderthals and modern humans.

A finger bone fragment of a juvenile female was discovered. She lived about 41,000 years ago,  with about 3% to 5% of the DNA of Melanesians and [[Indigenous peoples|

aboriginal]] Australians and around 6% in Papuans deriving from Denisovans.

The mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of the finger bone showed it was genetically distinct from Neanderthals and modern humans. The nuclear genome from this specimen suggested that Denisovans shared a common origin with Neanderthals.

DNA analysis has indicated that modern humans, Neanderthals, and the Denisova hominin last shared a common ancestor around 1 million years ago.

The mtDNA analysis also suggested that this species was the result of a migration out of Africa that came between a migration by Homo erectus individuals and later ones by some ancestors of most modern humans.

[[Endometriosis]]

CATEGORIES: Diseases and disorders of the female reproductive system

Endometriosis is a sickness when endometrium cells of the uterus grow outside the uterus. As many as 11% of American women between 15 and 44 years-old may have this sickness. It is most common in women 30-40 years-old. Having endometriosis can make it hard to have a baby. Endometriosis can be treated by a doctor. Treating endometriosis may help a woman get pregnant.

Other problems:

A woman can have endometriosis for a long time. It can be very painful. Women with endometriosis can have problems with their menstrual flow. This sickness can be so painful that it affects many areas of life.

Endometriosis is hard to find in some women. To find endometriosis in a woman a doctor may order many medical tests. These tests may be a pelvic exam and an ultrasound. When a woman has a pelvic exam the doctor will feel for lumps or scars. An ultrasound will help the doctor see cysts on the ovaries. The doctor may put a wand-shaped ultrasound probe into the vagina. A scanner may be used on your abdomen. Another test may be used. It is called an MRI. The MRI takes a picture of the inside of the body.

A doctor may try to treat endometriosis with medicine. There are different kinds of medicine that treat endometriosis. Birth control medicine can help some women have less pain. Another kind of medicine is called Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists. If the pain is less after taking medicine then the doctor may decide that the woman has endometriosis. If the woman stops taking the medicine the pain may come back.

Endometriosis is treated with surgery on some women. This is called laparoscopy. The doctor doing the surgery can look inside the body to find endometriosis tissue. Surgery is the only way to be sure that a woman has endometriosis. The doctor may see endometriosis tissue during laparoscopy. A doctor may remove a sample and study it under the microscope to decide.

[[Univers]]

CATEGORIES: Fonts

Univers is the name of a sans-serif typeface family designed by Adrian Frutiger and released in 1957. It is sans-serif in a geometrical style. It was made in a huge range of weights and widths. Univers was based on a much earlier design of about 1898, called Akzidenz-Grotesk.

Univers was one of the first typeface families to fulfil the idea that a typeface should form a family of consistent, related designs. By creating a matched range of styles and weights, Univers allowed documents to be created in one consistent typeface for all text documents. This matched the desire among practitioners of the "Swiss style" of typography for neutral sans-serif typefaces avoiding artistic excesses. By "excesses" might be meant blackletter, which had been used earlier in German language publications. But Univers also leaves out all the styling of the classical Roman lettering, including the use of serifs at the end of letter strokes.

One important influence was the coming of modernism, with its rejection of tradition in favour of plain function. That is mentioned by most of the people who promoted Univers and other sans serif fonts. Critics of Univers critics point to its lack of character, and monotony when used (as it is) on a huge variety of printed forms.  

Historian James Mosley has described it as "probably the last major" release of a large family as metal type. The font is available for phototypesetting and computer typesetting. It is marketed under licence by almost all outlets serving the print industry.

[[Momo Challenge hoax]]

CATEGORIES: Hoaxes, Social networking

The "Momo Challenge" is a hoax and urban legend about a social media challenge that didn’t exist. It was mainly spread on Facebook. The hoax says that victims are made to contact a "Momo" account through social media network WhatsApp. If they do, they get violent images, graphic threats and are told to do dangerous things, including suicide, record it on video and send it to "Momo". They might also say they are going to make their personal information public, hurt their family members, and some are even threatened with curses. An image of a woman with large eyes and mouth, which was shocking to some people, was used with the hoax.

The hoax made people believe the "challenge" had caused many suicides, including one in Argentina, but this is not true according to police. The image used by Momo accounts is actually of a sculpture made by a Japanese artist, but some people thought it was a mask or makeup.

[[20 Fenchurch Street]]

CATEGORIES: Skyscrapers in the United Kingdom, Buildings and structures in London

20 Fenchurch Street is a commercial skyscraper in London that takes its name from its address on Fenchurch Street, in the historic City of London financial district. It has been nicknamed The Walkie-Talkie because of its distinctive shape. The 34-storey building is 160 tall, making it the fifth-tallest building in the City of London.

Designed by architect Rafael Viñoly and costing over £200 million, 20 Fenchurch Street features a highly distinctive top-heavy form which appears to burst upward and outward. A large viewing deck, bar and restaurants are included on the top three floors; these are open to the public.

The tower was originally proposed at nearly 200 tall but its design was scaled down after concerns about its visual impact on the nearby St Paul's Cathedral and Tower of London. It was subsequently approved in 2006 with the revised height. Even after the height reduction there were continued concerns from heritage groups about its impact on the surrounding area. The project was consequently the subject of a public inquiry; in 2007 this ruled in the developers' favour and the building was granted full planning permission.

In their preliminary results for 2007, joint-developers Land Securities and Canary Wharf Group said 20 Fenchurch Street would be completed in 2011, however in 2009 during the depths of the Great Recession, the estimated completion was changed to 2014.

[[Wild Frontier]]

Wild Frontier is the sixth solo studio album by Irish guitarist Gary Moore, released in 1987. His first studio effort after a trip back to his native Belfast, Northern Ireland in 1985.

The album is dedicated to the memory of Moore's close friend and former Thin Lizzy bandmate Phil Lynott, who died on 4 January 1986, with the words "For Philip" on the rear cover.

Wild Frontier contains the hit single "Over the Hills and Far Away", which reached No. 20 in the UK, as well as a cover of the Easybeats' song "Friday on My Mind". The Max Middleton-penned "The Loner" which was originally recorded by Cozy Powell for his Over the Top album in 1979 (on which Moore performed, but not on Powell's recording of "The Loner"). The track was substantially altered by Moore for his own recording, that is why he is credited as a co-writer.

All drums on Wild Frontier are sequenced with a drum machine, although the programming is uncredited in the liner notes of the album. Future Toto drummer Simon Phillips would appear on the music video for "Over the Hills and Far Away," as well in early promotions for the album.

[[Asteroid impact prediction]]

CATEGORIES: Asteroids, Impact events

Asteroid impact prediction warns about asteroids hitting Earth, and when and where they will hit the Earth. Most asteroids will not hit Earth. Asteroid impact prediction works by finding the ones that will hit Earth. It finds asteroids that might hit Earth in the future. This works well for big asteroids as they can be seen easily from a long distance, many years before they come close to Earth. 

There aren't many big asteroids, but there are millions of smaller space rocks. They are not normally bright enough to see until they are close to Earth. We use telescopes to find the asteroids that are going to hit Earth soon. The telescopes are not good enough to see the small asteroids unless everything is perfect. Because of this we almost never see them before they hit Earth.

CATEGORIES: Armour

Plate armour is a type of body armour made from iron or steel plates. The iconic suit of armour that entirely covers the wearer is plate armour. The earliest example of plate armour is the Roman army's Lorica segmentata. However full plate armour was mainly made in Europe in the late middle ages. This was an improvement on the coat of plates that had been worn over chain mail in the 13th century. It reached its peak popularity in the 15th and 16th centuries. It is often associated with medieval knights, since modified plate armour was used in jousting. However after 1650 only the breastplate was generally worn. This is because the musket was created: the musket could pierce plate armour over long distances.

The Eurovision Song Contest 2007 was the 52nd edition of the annual Eurovision Song Contest. It took place in Helsinki, Finland, following Lordi's win at the 2006 contest in Athens, Greece with the song "Hard Rock Hallelujah". The contest was held at the Hartwall Areena in Helsinki, Finland from 10 May to 12 May, and staged by host broadcaster Yle.

A budget of €13 million was presented for arranging the contest. Other bids to host the contest came from Espoo, Turku and Tampere. The hosts were Finnish television personality Jaana Pelkonen and Finnish musician, stage performer and actor Mikko Leppilampi. Krisse Salminen acted as guest host in the green room, and reported from the crowds at the Senate Square.

A record number of 42 countries participated. The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) put aside its limit of 40 countries, which would have meant excluding some countries using a ranking order scheme.

The winner was Serbia, appearing as an independent country for the first time.

After Lordi scored the first ever Eurovision victory with a hard rock song, several countries sent rock songs to the Contest rather than the soft pop and schlager styles more closely associated with Eurovision. This trend continued at the 2008 and 2009 Contests.

Cyprus and Latvia entered songs in languages other than their own or English.  Although this happened with the Belgium 2003 entry, this was the first time the contest featured countries doing this with actual languages as opposed to an imaginary one.

People were scared that vaccines might cause autism after an English doctor called Andrew Wakefield wrote a scientific article that said that they did. It was a fraud. When the General Medical Council found out, they took away his licence to be a doctor. The Vaxxed film was made by Andrew Wakefield.

Scientists have looked carefully at the MMR vaccine and found that it does not cause autism.

According to Variety magazine, the film "purports to investigate the claims of a senior scientist at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who revealed that the CDC had allegedly manipulated and destroyed data on an important study about autism and the MMR vaccine". This did not happen.

Even though they have very wide angles of view, fisheye lenses show less vignetting. Vignetting occurs when the border of the image is much darker than the center. 

Because of their wide angle of view, fisheye lenses are often used in cameras used for surveillance.

[[Public inquiry]]

CATEGORIES: Public speaking, Democracy, Government

A public inquiry (or tribunal of inquiry) is an official review ordered by a government body. 

It is used in many common law countries, such as the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia and Canada. The idea is also used in many other countries, perhaps not with the same title. It is an expression of democracy, that in some cases people and groups should be able to have their voice heard directly. The issues at stake may be of a local kind, or special to a particular group of people.

A public inquiry differs from a Royal Commission. A public inquiry accepts evidence, conducts its hearings in public and deals with a specific occurrence. Interested members of the public and organisations may make oral  or written submissions, and listen to oral evidence given by other parties.

Research on the effects of public inquiries suggests they may not do much to change people's minds. However, it is normal for a public enquiry to be about some controversy. That is the point of the exercise.

[[Gentleman]]

CATEGORIES: Society

A gentleman is an historical term used in the British class system for an educated man who is wealthy. Its significance is that in a class system, people were educated, lived and worked in quite different ways according to the circumstances of their birth. This is behind the otherwise strange divide in sports like cricket between amateur and professionals (who often played in the same side), and between Rugby Union and Rugby League.

This distinction is needed to understand many of the novels, plays, and films of the pre-WWII era. Similar distinctions ran in most other countries before the modern era. Consider the characters in Tolstoy's War and Peace as an example.

A Brazilian company called Birdo made the mascots. The Olympic organizers only wanted mascots made by Brazilian companies. The organizers chose Birdo's mascots in August 2013, and they showed them to the public on 23 November 2014, but the mascots did not have names yet at that time. The organizers asked the public to choose names for them. The public chose to name the mascots after Vinicius de Moraes and Tom Jobim. Vinicius de Moraes and Tom Jobim wrote the song "The Girl from Ipanema".

The Olympic organizers made a children's television series about the mascots. The Rio organizers also made many toys and other merchandise of the mascots. The organizers gave wrestling coaches soft dolls of Vinicius. If the coaches did not like a referee's call, then they would throw the doll into the ring. Many people thought that this was funny. Paralympic medalists got special dolls of Tom. They were special because the leaves on Tom's head were the same color as their medals. Some observers liked how the mascots looked. Others thought they looked strange.

There are many parallels between different neurodegenerative disorders including atypical protein assemblies as well as induced cell death. Neurodegeneration can be found in many different levels of neuronal circuitry ranging from molecular to systemic.

[[St John Ambulance]]

CATEGORIES: International organizations, Charities

St John Ambulance is a group of organizations which provide first aid and emergency medicine. They work in over 40 countries, mostly in the Commonwealth of Nations.

The role of St John Ambulance varies. For example, in some parts of Australia, St John Ambulance are the main ambulance service. In most places, St John Ambulance are mostly volunteers and their role is to provide first aid at local events (e.g. sports matches, local fairs, races, etc.) and first aid training to the public.

St John Ambulance is run by its founders, the Venerable Order of Saint John. The Order is a descendant of the Knights Hospitaller of the Middle Ages. They founded the first branch of St John Ambulance in the United Kingdom in the 19th century. In 1877, the St John Ambulance Association was set up to teach first aid skills. In 1887, the St John Ambulance Brigade was founded to provide first aid at local events. These two have since been merged into the English branch of St John Ambulance.

First aiders for St John Ambulance are often seen wearing uniform. They originally had army ranks, though many now use non-military ranks instead. Some branches have cadets, for teenagers and older children.

All branches of St John Ambulance use the eight-point Maltese Cross as their logo. This symbol appears on a number of organizations descended from the Knights Hospitaller. The Order of Malta Ambulance Corps in Ireland is an example. Other similar organizations include Red Cross and Red Crescent (a worldwide movement) and St Andrew's First Aid in Scotland.

[[Tongyong Pinyin]]

CATEGORIES: Romanization, Words, Chinese language

Tongyong Pinyin is a romanization of Mandarin Chinese, or a way to write Mandarin in the Roman alphabet, that was invented in Taiwan. It was created by the Taiwanese to oppose Hanyu Pinyin, which is the official romanization of Mandarin in Mainland China, the UN, and most other international organizations, because many Taiwanese do not want to use a writing system created by the Chinese Communist Party. In 2002, it became the official romanization in Taiwan, even though no one was forced to use it. However, in 2009, Taiwan replaced Tongyong with Hanyu as the island's official romanization. While Taipei mostly uses Hanyu spelling today, many cities, particularly in southern Taiwan, still use many different romanizations, including Tongyong spelling, and it can still be seen in many places.

[[Disappearance of Bobby Dunbar]]

Bobby Dunbar was an American boy whose disappearance at the age of four and apparent return was widely reported in newspapers across the United States in 1912 and 1913. 

In August 1912, the Dunbars took a fishing trip to nearby Swayze Lake in St. Landry Parish, Louisiana.  On August 23, while on that trip, Bobby Dunbar disappeared.

After an eight-month nationwide search, investigators believed that they had found the child in Mississippi, in the hands of William Cantwell Walters of North Carolina. 

Dunbar's parents claimed the boy as their missing son. However, both Walters and a woman named Julia Anderson said that the boy with him was Anderson's son. Julia Anderson could not afford a lawyer, and the court eventually sided for the Dunbars. Percy and Lessie Dunbar retained custody of the child, who proceeded to live out the remainder of his life as Bobby Dunbar.  

In 2004, DNA test found that the boy found with Walters and "returned" to the Dunbars as Bobby had not been a blood relative of the Dunbar family. Since the DNA testing is conclusive, the fate of the actual Bobby Dunbar remains unsolved.

[[Gwoyeu Romatzyh]]

CATEGORIES: Chinese language, Romanization

Gwoyeu Romatzyh (pinyin: Guóyǔ luómǎzì, literally "National Language Romanization"), abbreviated GR, is a romanization of Mandarin Chinese, or a way to write Mandarin using the Roman alphabet, made by Yuen Ren Chao and some other linguists in the late 1920s. It was made as a way to write Mandarin using tonal spelling, or spelling rules that would change the syllable's spelling depending on its tone. For example, the syllable chai would be written as chai if it has the first Mandarin tone (or chāi in Pinyin), chair if it has the second tone (chái), chae if it has the third tone (chăi), and chay if it had the fourth tone (chài). Y.R. Chao created GR in order to increase literacy in China because China's illiteracy was very high in the early 20th century. He made it that tones could be written without extra tone markers, which can be long and difficult to add when printing. 

Even though many other Asian languages use tonal spelling, like Hmong, they all represent tones by using the same letter each time the tone is used. In Hmong, for example, -b is always a high tone, -s is always a low tone, -j is always high-falling tone. In GR, however, each syllable final has its own spelling rules, and many exceptions exist within these rules. For example, first tone words with the final -a as in bā is written with just one vowel like ba, except when the syllable begins with an l-, m-, or n-, which then must be written as lha, mha, and nha in that order. This is only one of its many rules and exceptions. 

Unsurprisingly, many people thought GR was too difficult to learn. Nonetheless, it still has many supporters, and they would rather learn using GR than Pinyin. While supporters of GR claim that it helps users of GR remember tones better than people who just use Pinyin, studies have not supported this claim. As a matter of fact, one study showed that after one year, the subjects who learned Chinese using Pinyin could more accurately speak Mandarin with tones than those who learned using GR. 

After the Communist Party took over China, it tried to replaced all romanizations of Chinese, including GR, with Pinyin. While GR is not an official romanization in Taiwan, it can be seen in several places, including road signs, people's names, and the names of products, even though Hanyu Pinyin is the official romanization of Taiwan. 

Even though almost all romanizations in mainland China today are in Pinyin, there are still some exceptions. For example, the name of the province Shaanxi is written in GR rather than in Pinyin, which would be Shǎnxī with tone markers, because there is already another province named Shanxi, which is written as Shānxī with tones. If the Pinyin names were to be written without tone markers (which they often are in everyday Pinyin), they should both be spelled Shanxi. Therefore they would be impossible to tell apart using just Pinyin without tones. Therefore, an exception has been made in this case. 

Below are examples of sentences written in Chinese characters, Pinyin, and GR with English translations.

The sons were Caracalla and Geta. After the death of Septimius Severus, his sons were initially joint emperors. Caracalla had Geta assassinated in 212; Geta's memorials were destroyed. All images or mentions of him were removed from public buildings and monuments. So, Geta's image and inscriptions were removed from the arch (damnatio memoriae).

The company handles distribution rights to acquired series, mini-series, and made-for-TV films from the Paramount Television libraries (such as those of Desilu Productions, Paramount Television, Viacom Productions and Enterprises, Republic Pictures Television, Big Ticket Entertainment, Spelling Television, and Worldvision Enterprises), and series, mini-series, and made-for-TV films from the CBS television libraries (such as those by CBS Productions, King World Productions, the majority of those by Group W Productions, and its own first-run broadcast syndication and off-network television series). CBS also handles the TV rights to much of its own theatrical films. The company formerly distributed the film libraries from Paramount Pictures and Republic Pictures, among others. The company is also responsible for international television distribution rights to series by Rysher Entertainment including certain HBO series through its CBS Studios International division.

This would mark the sixth distribution name for CBS as CBS Television Film Sales was the first (1952–1958), CBS Films, Inc. was the second (1958–1967), CBS Enterprises was the third (1968–1971), Eyemark Entertainment was the fourth (1995–2000), and CBS Paramount Domestic Television was the fifth (2006–2012).

From 2006 to 2008, CTD distributed the DreamWorks Television and DreamWorks Pictures libraries in conjunction with Tribune Entertainment, after Viacom's acquisition of DreamWorks in February 2006, but before the studio was spun off. These distribution rights are now held by Disney-ABC Domestic Television (for live-action TV series and post-9/2005 live-action films) and Trifecta Entertainment & Media (for earlier live-action films and all animated productions).

Until May 2009, CTD distributed the Paramount Pictures library on television. By then, CBS also dropped the name "Paramount" from television for good, renaming CBS Paramount Television to CBS Television Studios. Paramount has also joined up with Trifecta. However, CTD continues to distribute films currently copyrighted by CBS (or a subdivision thereof), including those films from Cinema Center Films and CBS Theatrical Films, along with a few select entries to which CBS bought ancillary rights in later years, such as My Fair Lady.

The current moniker for CTD's overseas distribution arm is CBS Studios International (since 2009). Its predecessors were CBS Broadcast International and CBS Paramount International Television.

CATEGORIES: 1975 births, Dominican Republic sportspeople, American League All-Stars, National League All-Stars, Baltimore Orioles players, Montreal Expos players, Texas Rangers players, Living people, Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim players

Vladimir Alvino Guerrero (born February 9, 1975), nicknamed Vlad, Vlady and Vlad the Impaler, is a Dominican former professional baseball player who spent 16 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a right fielder and designated hitter. He played for the Montreal Expos (1996–2003), Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim (2004–09), Texas Rangers (2010), and Baltimore Orioles (2011).

Guerrero is considered one of the greatest batters of all time, and is widely regarded as the best "bad ball" batter of all time (the ability to hit pitches outside of the strike zone). He was well known for putting the ball into play, and particularly on the first pitch.  He had exceptional hands at the plate, and would bat without batting gloves.  Guerrero was able to hit for both power and average.  In the outfield, Guerrero was sometimes considered a defensive liability, prone to making errors, which resulted in him being a designated hitter in the last stage of his remarkable career, but he was also known to have a very powerful throwing arm that allowed him to make outfield assists on base runners.

Many baseball fans and critics believe Guerrero's career was overshadowed by those of other players due to playing for a small fan base in Montreal, and similarly, many believe that he deserved to win the 2000 National League Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award for his remarkable season, an award which instead was won by Barry Bonds.

Guerrero barely missed being elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame on the first ballot (first year of candidacy), but he was admitted in on the second ballot.

One of Guerrero's sons, Vladimir Guerrero Jr., plays in MLB.

[[Hyperaccumulator]]

CATEGORIES: Plant physiology

A hyperaccumulator is a plant that can grow in soils with very high concentrations of metals.

Featured by the BBC is a tree on the island of New Caledonia, Pycnandra acuminata, which grows on soil rich in nickel. Many different plants do this in several different plant families.

The advantage of hyperaccumulation of metals may be that the toxic levels of heavy metals in leaves deter herbivores (defence against herbivory).

Several gene families are involved in hyperaccumulation including absorbing and storing heavy metals. The genes most usually involved are the ZIP gene family. These genes code for membrane receptors for the transport of, for example, zinc molecules.

These hyperaccumulation genes (HA genes) are found in over 450 plant species, including the model organisms Arabidopsis and the Brassicaceae.  Expression of HA genes allows the plant to uptake and sequester metals such as As, Co, Fe, Cu, Cd, Pb, Hg, Se, Mn, Zn, Mo and Ni in 100–1000 times the concentration found in sister species or populations.

[[Subroutine]]

CATEGORIES: Computer programming

Subroutines are commonly paired with parameter, a type of variable.

[[Doxing]]

CATEGORIES: Computing, Crime

Doxing is the process of finding out, digging for or uncovering personal information on a person, group, organization or corporate entity, compiling it in an organized format and posting it online. The end result of doxing is a dox. Doxes are often shared to incite harassment, intimidation, and/or violent acts toward their victims. It can be used to help police or to assist criminals. Typically, a person is doxed for revenge-based reasons, motivating the person who is wronged or who has perceived a wrong to humiliate and expose their target. Doxing is legal in all 50 U.S. states, only if the information is gathered from public websites, is public knowledge and does not contain private information such as SSNs or cell phone numbers. 

Doxing was originally started, back in the 1980s to 1990s, by black-hat hackers and penetration testers of the time to silence and/or intimate their hacker rivals in the BBS and internet communities. Doxing is a form of vigilantism and many instances of doxing have led to swatting, years of harassment, people having to move out of their homes and change their phone numbers. Being doxed will also make you more vulnerable to identity theft. In the present day, specifically in the United States, doxing is used as a method of political dissent and political attack, primarily by left-leaning people against those with Conservative leanings. Doxing as well as deplatforming have become an integral part of "Cancel Culture."

[[Affricate]]

CATEGORIES: Linguistics

Affricates are consonants that are said with a stop with a fricative immediately afterwards. For example, the 'ch' sound in English (written as /t͡ʃ/ in IPA) is said with an 't' (/t/)  sound with an 'sh' (/ʃ/) sound immediately afterwards. Both voiced and voiceless affricates exist; in English, they are /d͡ʒ/ (the 'j' sound) and t͡ʃ (the 'ch' sound) respectively. 

In Mandarin Chinese, affricates are told apart by aspiration, or breathiness, since voiced affricates do not exist; aspirated affricates, or breathy affricates, are /t͡ɕʰ/ (written as 'q' in Hanyu Pinyin), /t͡sʰ/ ('c'), and /ʈ͡ʂʰ/ ('ch'), and unaspirated affricates, or non-breathy affricates, are /t͡ɕ/ ('j'), /t͡s/ ('z'), and /ʈ͡ʂ/ ('zh').

[[Aspiration]]

CATEGORIES: Linguistics

Aspiration is a feature in languages where saying a consonant gives out a puff of air. For example, if you dangle a piece of paper in front of your mouth, you will see it move if you say an aspirated, or breathy, consonant. If the paper does not move, then it is unaspirated, or not breathy. In English, voiceless stops and fricatives that happen at the beginning of a word are aspirated, which are the sounds 'p', 't', 'k', and 'ch' (which are written as /p/, /t/, /k/, /t͡ʃ/ in IPA in the same order). In IPA, aspirated sounds can be written with an ʰ symbol afterwards, as in /pʰ/, /tʰ/, /kʰ/, and /t͡ʃʰ/. For example, the first sound in the words "pick", "tick", "kick", and "chick" are all aspirated. In IPA, they are written as /pʰɪk/, /tʰɪk/, /kʰɪk/, and /t͡ʃʰɪk/ in the same order. However, voiceless stops and fricatives that appear after the first sound are unaspirated. For example, while the /p/ in "pit" is aspirated, the /p/ in "spit" and the /p/ in "tip" are not, so they would not be marked with an ʰ symbol afterwards. Below are more examples of aspiration.

English has no aspirated voiced sounds, but Hindi does. They are normally written with an 'h' after the consonant letter. An example of this is the name Bhattacharya, in which 'bh' is an aspirated 'b' sound, so it would be written as /bʱ/ in IPA.

In Mandarin Chinese, there are no voiced stops, fricatives, or affricates, so the only way to tell them apart is by aspiration. In Pinyin, aspirated sounds are written like voiceless sounds in English, so the sounds /pʰ/, /tʰ/, and /kʰ/ are written as 'p', 't', and 'k' in the same order, but unaspirated sounds are written like voiced sounds in English, so the sounds /p/, /t/, and /k/ are written as 'b', 'd', and 'g' respectively. For example, the word "Gaokao" would be written in IPA as /kau̯.kʰau̯/. In Wade-Giles spelling, aspirated stops, fricatives, or affricates are written with an apostrophe after the letter instead of using a different letter like in Pinyin, so "Gaokao" would be written as "Kaok'ao" in Wade-Giles.

[[National Higher Education Entrance Examination]]

CATEGORIES: Education, Colleges and universities in the People's Republic of China

The National Higher Education Entrance Examination, or the Gaokao, is the People's Republic of China's national-level university entrance exam. All high school students in China must take the Gaokao in their last year of school, and much of their time in high school is spent preparing to take the exam. Like many other Asian countries, such as Japan, South Korea, and India, the Gaokao has been well-known internationally for being a very difficult exam because many students do not get a high enough score to attend university in China.

The required subjects are mathematics, Chinese and English, and the full score of each three subjects is 150 points. For the remaining subjects, there are two choices: the liberal arts comprehensive are history, geography and politics, with a score of 100 for each subject; The science subjects include physics, chemistry and biology, with 100 points for each subject. Students are allowed to choose between science and liberal arts based on their level of study, and each student scored a maximum of 750. Although two kinds of choice means brought the power that examinee learns, but in China, the obtain employment of liberal arts living is more difficult than science living, the score of the university entrance exam also is lower than science living, so the examinee that chooses science department is much more than the examinee that chooses liberal arts.

In the national college entrance examination in June 2018, 9.75 million people took the exam, which shows the great pressure of competition. It is a pity that many people are ruined on their way to university just because of one failure in the exam. One of the disadvantages of Chinese education is that it only takes one exam to select talents. However, because there are too many references, the nation can only select talents through examinations. Facts have proved that this selection method still has some merits.

[[Crystal field theory]]

CATEGORIES: Chemical bonding, Transition metals

Crystal Field Theory (CFT) is a scientific representation of how metals behave when dissolved in water to form a special type of chemical called a complex. This model may be used to predict the colors of certain metal containing chemicals when dissolved in water, as well as their reactions when placed near a magnet. It may also be use to predict the shape of the chemicals. CFT  does not predict the connections between atoms. CFT  was created by physicists Hans Bethe and John Hasbrouck van Vleck in 1930. It was later combined with the molecular orbital theory to create the ligand field theory, which does describe the connections between atoms.

[[High Plains (United States)]]

CATEGORIES: Geography of Colorado

The High Plains are a subregion of the Great Plains. They are the western part of the Great Plains before the region reaches the Rocky Mountains.

The High Plains are in southeastern Wyoming, southwestern South Dakota, western Nebraska, eastern Colorado, western Kansas, eastern New Mexico, western Oklahoma, and south of the Texas Panhandle. They are mostly in the Western United States, but also partly in the Midwest states of Nebraska, Kansas, and South Dakota.

Geologically, the high plains are caused by the same process as caused the Rockies. The cause is the westward movement of North America away from Eurasia, which has been going on for over 100 million years. As the continent moved west, it subducted plates under the western side, and stretched out its eastern side. This explains why the western states all have some mountainous terrain, and the eastern states in the south are so low-lying.

From east to west, the High Plains rise in elevation from around 1160 to over 7800. The High Plains has a "cold semi-arid" climate—Köppen BSk—they get between 10 of precipitation annually.

Due to low moisture and high elevation, the High Plains get extremes of temperature. The temperature range from day to night is usually 30, and 24-hour temperature shifts of 100 are possible.

In Browning, Montana from January 23, 1916 to January 24, 1916, the temperature fell from 44. This is the world record for the greatest temperature change in 24 hours. The region is known for the steady, and sometimes intense, winds that come from the west. These add a considerable wind chill factor in the winter.  The development of wind farms in the High Plains is one of the latest areas of economic development.

The High Plains has one of the lowest population densities of any region in the continental United States; Wyoming, for example, has the second lowest population density in the country after Alaska.

[[Koch's postulates]]

CATEGORIES: Bacteria, Infectious diseases

Koch's postulates  are four ideas about the relationship between a microbe and a disease. 

The postulates were made by Robert Koch and Friedrich Loeffler in 1884, based on earlier ideas of Jakob Henle. They were refined and published by Koch in 1890. 

Koch applied the postulates to cholera and tuberculosis, but they have been used for other diseases. These postulates were made before viruses were discovered. Also, they did not realise that some people were "asymptomatic carriers": they could carry the disease without showing signs of it. The postulates are little used today. Other criteria are used, for example the Bradford Hill criteria for infectious diseases in modern public health.

[[Greylag goose]]

CATEGORIES: Geese

The greylag goose (Anser anser) is a species of large grey goose in the waterfowl family Anatidae. It is the largest goose. Its distribution is widespread. Birds from the north of its range in Europe and Asia migrate south to spend the winter in warmer places. 

It is the type species of the genus Anser and is the ancestor of the domestic goose. It has been domesticated at least since 1360 BC. The genus name is from anser, the Latin for "goose".

Greylag geese travel to their northerly breeding grounds in spring, nesting on moorlands, in marshes, around lakes and on coastal islands. They normally mate for life and nest on the ground among vegetation. A clutch of three to five eggs is laid. The female incubates the eggs and both parents defend and rear the young. The birds stay together as a family group, migrating southwards in autumn as part of a flock, and separating the following year. During the winter they occupy semi-aquatic habitats, estuaries, marshes and flooded fields, feeding on grass and agricultural crops. Some populations, such as those in Southern England and in urban areas, are resident and occupy the same area year-round.

[[Gizzard]]

CATEGORIES: Anatomy of the digestive system

A gizzard, or "gastric mill", is a part of the stomach which grinds food. Animals which have grinding teeth do not need a gizzard, but there are many animals which do have one.

Gizzards are standard equipment for pterosaurs and birds, dinosaurs, and crocodilia, also many fish, and crustacea. 

Gizzards work because the animal eats some gravel and small stones, and they grind against the food in the gizzard. Gizzards are muscular, and lined with tough material.

In birds, it works like this. Birds swallow food and store it in their crop if necessary. Then the food passes into their glandular stomach, or proventriculus. Secretions are added here to the food. Then the food passes into the gizzard (also known as the muscular stomach or ventriculus). The gizzard can grind the food with previously swallowed stones and pass it back to the true stomach, and vice versa. In layman's terms, the gizzard 'chews' the food for the bird as it does not have teeth. Bird gizzards are lined with a tough layer made of the carbohydrate-protein complex koilin, to protect the muscles in the gizzard.

In birds the stomach is before the gizzard, but in grasshoppers the gizzard comes before the stomach. In earthworms there is only a gizzard, and no stomach.

Chemistry

Richard Henderson GBR (born 19 July 1945) is a Scottish molecular biologist and biophysicist. He is a pioneer in the field of electron microscopy of biological molecules.  He shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2017 with Jacques Dubochet and Joachim Frank.

Henderson has worked at the Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology (MRC LMB) in Cambridge since 1973, and was its director between 1996 and 2006. He was also a visiting professor at the Miller Institute of the University of California, Berkeley in Spring 1993.

He worked out the structure of bacteriorhodopsin, a molecule in bacteria. The molecule captures energy from light, and uses it to move protons out of the cell. This was the second ever atomic model of a membrane protein. The techniques Henderson developed for electron crystallography are still in use. 

Henderson's methods help to solve the structures of several G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs). They are a large protein family of receptors that detect molecules outside the cell. They activate internal signal transduction pathways. This leads to cell responses to the molecules outside the cell.

[[Van Allen radiation belt]]

CATEGORIES: NASA, Space, Earth

A Van Allen radiation belt is a zone of charged particles which come from the Sun as the solar wind. They are captured and held by the Earth's magnetic field.

Earth has two such belts and sometimes others. 

The belts were discovered by James Van Allen. Earth's two main belts extend from the altitude of about 500 to 58,000 

Most of the particles that form the belts are thought to come from solar wind and other particles by cosmic rays. By trapping the solar wind, the magnetic field deflects those energetic particles and protects the atmosphere from destruction.

The belts are in the inner region of Earth's magnetosphere. The belts trap energetic electrons and protons. The belts endanger satellites, which must have their sensitive components protected with adequate shielding if they spend much time in that zone. In 2013, NASA reported that the Van Allen Probes had discovered a third radiation belt, which was observed for four weeks. It was destroyed by a powerful, interplanetary shock wave from the Sun.

[[Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market]]

CATEGORIES: Copyright, European Union

The Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market is a proposed directive (a type of special EU law) that is aimed at protecting EU's existing copyright laws, with particular focus aiming at company intellectual property. It was first introduced to the European Parliament Committee on Legal Affairs on 20 June 2018. On 12 September 2018, the European Parliament approved a revised version of this directive. This directive will be expected to take place in January 2019. If this directive passes, each country of the EU will be required to create laws that support this new directive.

The European Council described their key goals as ways to reduce the amount of conflict related to copyright violation. One of their goals is to reduce the "value gap" between the profits made by internet platforms and content creators, which involves requiring financial agreement before they can use their content. Another one of their goals is to encourage "collaboration" between companies and people who use their products. The other goal they proposed is creating copyright exceptions for text and data mining (the use of high quality words to describe specific copyrighted content).

The directive aims to give online press publishers more freedom to protect their content from news aggregators (Article 11), as well as requiring websites who primarily host content posted by users to warn users very harshly against posting unauthorized copyrighted content (Article 13).

Articles 11 and 13 have attracted widespread criticism from many people and companies in Europe and North America. Article 11 has been criticised as a "link tax" which would require websites to obtain a license before linking to and previewing (using html snippets) news stories, and Article 13 as a "meme ban", because current content-filtering technology cannot distinguish copyright violation from fair dealing such as parody, and may counteract the panorama freedom. Supporters of the directive, mostly from large companies that support copyright, ignore these claims and think that it is disinformation. People from large companies that support this new directive try to claim that the opposers are trying to make the information seem worse than it actually is.

CATEGORIES: 1827 births, 1912 deaths, Fellows of the Royal Society, Presidents of the Royal Society, Surgeons

Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister, GBR (5 April 1827spaced ndash10 February 1912) was a British surgeon and a pioneer of antiseptic surgery.

He promoted the idea of sterile surgery while working at the Glasgow Royal Infirmary. Lister successfully introduced carbolic acid (phenol) to sterilise surgical instruments and to clean wounds.

Applying Louis Pasteur's advances in microbiology, Lister championed the use of carbolic acid as an antiseptic, so that it became the first widely used antiseptic in surgery. 

He knew it was used to ease the stench from fields irrigated with sewage waste.  He thought it was safe because fields treated with carbolic acid had no ill-effects on the livestock that grazed on them.

Lister's work led to a reduction in post-operative infections (infections after an operation). This made surgery safer for patients. So he became known as the "father of modern surgery".

William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin, GBR (26 June 1824 – 17 December 1907) was a Scots-Irish mathematical physicist and engineer. He was born in Belfast in 1824. At the University of Glasgow he did important work in the mathematical analysis of electricity and formed the first and second laws of thermodynamics. 

Kelvin did much to unify physics in its modern form. He also had a career as an electric telegraph engineer and inventor, which propelled him into the public eye and gave him wealth, fame and honour. 

For his work on the transatlantic telegraph project he was knighted in 1866 by Queen Victoria, becoming Sir William Thomson. He was noted for his work on the mariner's compass. This had been rather unreliable owing to the iron in ships' hulls.

Absolute temperatures are stated in units of kelvin in his honour. The existence of a lower limit to temperature (absolute zero) was known before his work, but Lord Kelvin found its correct value as approximately −273.15 degree Celsius or −459.67 degree Fahrenheit.

He was made Lord Kelvin in 1892 in recognition of his achievements in thermodynamics, and of his opposition to Irish Home Rule. He became Baron Kelvin, of Largs in the County of Ayr. 

He was the first British scientist to be elevated to the House of Lords. His title refers to the River Kelvin, which flows close by his laboratory at the University of Glasgow.   Despite offers from several world-renowned universities, Lord Kelvin refused to leave Glasgow, remaining Professor of Natural Philosophy for over 50 years, until his eventual retirement.  The Hunterian Museum at the University of Glasgow has a permanent exhibition on the work of Lord Kelvin.

Always active in industrial research and development, he was recruited around 1899 by George Eastman to serve as vice-chairman of the board of the British company Kodak Limited, affiliated with Eastman Kodak.
