[[Cherry picking]]

CATEGORIES: Logical fallacies

Cherry picking is when someone picks the case which supports his opinion.

For example, suppose twenty studies have been done on a new medicine and 19 say it works, but one says it does not work. To "cherry pick" is to use the one failed study  to "prove" that the medicine is useless. It is a type of confirmation bias, where a person sees evidence for what they want or expect to see, and ignores evidence which goes against their belief.

The term cherry picking comes from when people harvest cherries from a tree - the cherry picker only takes the reddest, ripest fruits. If someone looked at all the fruit the person had picked, they might think that all the cherries were red, until they went to the tree and saw lots of pale, unripe cherries still on it.

Cherry picking as a term is quite negative, as it implies that the person doing the cherry picking is trying to deceive the audience, or simply does not care about the facts.

When applied to subjects like medicine and science, cherry picking is considered "bad science". or a sign of pseudoscience.

Cherry picking can take several forms. The most obvious case of cherry picking is where only evidence that supports a given argument is used, and other evidence which does not support it or goes against it is ignored or covered up. Other examples can include giving a lot of emphasis to evidence which supports the idea but barely any to other evidence, and taking a quote out of context so that it seems to have a different meaning than it originally did.

Pseudoscience is when untrue claims are made to appear as though they have a scientific basis, even though they do not. Many pseudoscientists cherry pick real scientific evidence to support their claims. It is quite common in science for some studies to contradict others, for example in cases where different methods are used to measure an outcome, or where human error or chance may lead to unusual results. This means that there is often a study someone can use to support their claim, and they can cherry pick that one study even if many more contradict it.

[[Toll-free telephone number]]

CATEGORIES: Telephone numbers

A toll-free telephone number is a telephone number in which the person who owns that telephone number is charged for calls that come to them, rather than the person making the call to that number being charged. These numbers usually begin with "1-800" in North America (800 being the area code under the North American Numbering Plan), but are different around the rest of the world.

They are not to be confused with "collect calls", which are made when the person making the call does not want to have to pay their telephone company to make it. In this case, the person receiving the call has to agree to be charged for that call, while those owning toll-free numbers already agree to being charged for incoming calls.

[[Collect call]]

CATEGORIES: Telephone

A collect call, also called a "reverse charge call", is a type of telephone call. Usually, when a telephone call is made, the person who makes the call pays for the call, rather than the person who receives the call at the other end. In a collect call, though, the person making the call wants the person they are calling to pay for the call instead.

In the past, these kinds of calls could only be done with a operator, who would need to ask the person receiving the call if they want to be charged for it. If the person receiving it does not want to be charged, the call cannot go through. Today, computers have made it possible to make or receive collect calls without talking to a person.

Collect calls used to be made a lot using payphones, but they are becoming less used since mobile phones and VoIP technology has come around and made long-distance calls cheaper to make.

It has been found out that the day of the year in which the most collect calls are made is Father's Day, even though the day when the most phone calls are made altogether is Mother's Day.

[[Dunn index]]

CATEGORIES: Algorithms, Statistics

The Dunn Index (DI) is a metric for judging a clustering algorithm. A higher DI implies better clustering. It assumes that better clustering means that clusters are compact and well-separated from other clusters.

There are many ways to define the size of a cluster and distance between clusters.

The DI is equal to the minimum inter-cluster distance divided by the maximum cluster size. Note that larger inter-cluster distances (better separation) and smaller cluster sizes (more compact clusters) lead to a higher DI value.

[[Ferrosilicon]]

CATEGORIES: Iron

Ferrosilicon is a combination of iron and silicon. Between 15% and 90% of ferrosilicon is silicon. Ferrosilicon is made by burning sand while there’s iron in the sand. Ferrosilicons that contain the most silicon are made in electric arc furnaces.

Perryite is a rock that is a combination of iron and silicon.

When ferrosilicon is touching water, it may slowly make hydrogen. Ferrosilicon is used by the military to quickly produce hydrogen for balloons. The chemical reaction uses sodium hydroxide, ferrosilicon, and water. The generator is small enough to fit in a truck and needs only a small amount of electric power. The materials are stable and not combustible, and they do not make hydrogen until mixed.

Ferrosilicon is used to get oxygen out of steel. Magnesium is made by combining ferrosilicon with dolomite.

The Zionist Union, Hebrew: המחנה הציוני‎‎ - HaMahaneh HaTziyoni, literally meaning The Zionist Camp, was an Israeli political cooperation. Its ideology is left-wing centrist, and Zionist.

The Zionist Union was formed in 2014 as a cooperation of HaAvoda (Israeli Labor Party), HaTnu'a ("The Movement"), and HaTnu'a HaYeruqa ("The Green Movement") in an effort to prevent Likud continuing its governing position after the Knesset elections of 2015.

Because its attempt was unsuccessful, party head Yitzhak Herzog became leader of the opposition. When Herzog left the Knesset in June 2018 to become head of the Jewish Agency for Israel, he was replaced by Tzipi Livni.

There were two political leaders. The party head was Avi Gabbay (HaAvoda). As Gabbay was not a Knesset member, Tzipi Livni (HaTnu'a) leaded this faction in the Knesset.

Number of seats in the 20th Knesset: 24 (HaAvoda: 19, HaTnu'a: 4, HaTnu'a HaYeruqa 1).

The Zionist Union was dissolved in 2019.

[[Ultraviolet catastrophe]]

The ultraviolet catastrophe is the name given to a conflict between theory and the observation in classical physics. 

An ideal black body at thermal equilibrium emits radiation in all frequency ranges. It emits more energy as the frequency increases. By calculating the total amount of radiated energy, it can be shown that a blackbody would release an infinite amount of energy. This contradicted the principles of conservation of energy and showed a new model was needed for the behaviour of blackbodies. This happened around the end of the nineteenth century. It was one of the things that led to the invention of quantum mechanics.

It led theorists like Max Planck to come up with quantum theory in which energy leaves the body in distinct packets called quanta rather than in continuous waves. The quantum theory accurately predicted the energy of the radiation that is observed.

Rayleigh-Jeans formula predicts that the radiated intensity should increase as square of frequency. So energy density (intensity) would become infinitely large at the high frequency end of the spectrum, but experimentally observed that it approaches zero.

This divergence for higher frequencies is called ultraviolet catastrophe.

[[Ontological argument]]

CATEGORIES: Philosophy

The ontological argument is an idea in religious philosophy. It is supposed to show that God exists.

There are different versions, but they all argue something like: because we can imagine a perfect being, there must be a god. The idea is that existing makes a good thing better than one that's only imaginary. So the perfect thing we're imagining must exist. Then we call the perfect thing God. The earliest objection was that an argument like that could prove wrong things. You could prove that a perfect island must exist, for example. But no real island is perfect.

Because it starts with imagination, not what you can see or experience, this is a kind of a priori reasoning. David Hume didn't like that way of thinking. He believed that knowledge had to come from experience and called everything else "nothing but sophistry and illusion".

Other versions of the argument start with the idea of the universe, and from that argue that there must be a god.

[[Gas operation (firearms)]]

CATEGORIES: Firearms

Gas-operation is a system of operation used to provide energy to operate autoloading firearms. In gas operation, a portion of high-pressure gas from the cartridge being fired is used to power a mechanism to extract the spent case and insert a new cartridge into the chamber. Energy from the gas is harnessed through either a port in the barrel or a trap at the muzzle. This high-pressure gas impinges on a surface such as a piston head to provide motion for unlocking of the action, extraction of the spent case, ejection, cocking of the hammer or striker, chambering of a fresh cartridge, and locking of the action.

However, the shotgun's futuristic appearance has made it popular in action movies and video games.

[[Amyloidosis]]

CATEGORIES: Diseases

Amyloidosis is a rare and serious disease that could be fatal that is caused by accumulation of proteins in the form of abnormal, insoluble fibres, known as amyloid fibrils, within the tissues of the body. 

Amyloid deposits can be confined to only one part of the body or a single organ system in 'local amyloidosis' or they can be widely distributed in organs and tissues throughout the body in 'systemic amyloidosis'. The symptoms of amyloidosis are accordingly highly variable and confirmation of the presence of amyloid in the tissues can be challenging, so that diagnosis is often delayed.

There are many different types of amyloidosis, each caused by formation of amyloid fibrils from different soluble precursor proteins in different patients. About 30 different proteins are known to form amyloid fibrils in humans and amyloidosis is named and classified according to the identity of the respective fibril protein.  

Though this disease being rare, many famous people have died from this disease such as: Martin McGuinness, David Lange, Robert Jordan and Robert P. Casey.

[[Open bolt]]

CATEGORIES: Firearms

A semi or fully automatic firearm is said to fire from an open bolt if, when ready to fire, the bolt and working parts are held to the rear. When the trigger is pulled the bolt goes forward, feeding a round from the magazine into the chamber and firing it. Like any other self-loading design without an external power supply, the action is cycled by the energy of the shot; this sends the bolt back to the rear, ejecting the empty cartridge case and preparing for the next shot (or continuing forward again, if the trigger is held down and the weapon is an automatic). Generally, an open-bolt firing cycle is used for fully automatic weapons and not for semi-automatic weapons (except some semi-automatic conversions of automatic designs). Firearms using Advanced Primer Ignition blowback inherently fire from open bolt only.

[[Owen submachine gun]]

CATEGORIES: Submachine guns

[[Leader Dynamics T2MK5]]

CATEGORIES: Firearms

The Leader T2 MK5 Series weapons were chambered for the 5.56×45mm NATO cartridge and manufactured by Leader Dynamics of Smithfield, NSW, Australia (1978-1982/1983). The Leader was the brainchild of weapons designer Charles St. George. It was originally a contender for a 5.56 mm Australian military service rifle to replace the then-issued Lithgow L1A1-F1 SLR and Colt M16A1 rifles. What was unique about this endeavor was that Australia had never designed or manufactured its own commercial gas-operated semi-automatic rifle. The rifle was abandoned when the Steyr AUG was adopted for use by the Australian military.

Of interest to those that study weapons, designs and evolution, the T2 used a triangular bolt-face that was similar to the Winchester Model 100. This was adopted because the original bolt-face was too complex and expensive to manufacture. In a case of parallel development, Barrett Firearms uses a similar design for the M82A1 and its bolt action guns. St. George worked for Barrett at around this time but was not involved in design or engineering duties.

[[Stalemate]]

CATEGORIES: Chess, Metaphors

Stalemate is a situation in chess where the player whose turn it is to move is not in check but has no legal move. 

When stalemate occurs, the game is a draw. Actual stalemate is rare, but the threat of stalemate has a big effect on endgame play. Many K+R+P vs K+R endings are drawn when stalemate cannot be avoided. The existence of stalemate is a main reason why draws are common in chess, but rare in the chess derivative shogi.

In the old Persian form of chess, shatranj, stalemate was a win for the side with the most pieces. The idea of stalemate as a draw in modern chess took a long time to be agreed. It was finally decided by the early 19th century British master J.H. Sarratt in the London Chess Club rules of 1807.

Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger (30 September 1882 – 24 September 1945) was a German physicist. He is perhaps best known as the co-inventor of the detector component of the Geiger counter and for the Geiger–Marsden experiment which discovered the atomic nucleus. Geiger was born at Neustadt an der Haardt, Germany. He was one of five children born to the Indologist Wilhelm Ludwig Geiger, who was professor at the University of Erlangen.

In 1902, Geiger started studying physics and mathematics at the University of Erlangen and was awarded a doctorate in 1906. In 1907 he began work with Ernest Rutherford at the University of Manchester and in 1909, along with Ernest Marsden, conducted the famous Geiger–Marsden experiment called the "gold foil experiment". Rutherford and Geiger created the Rutherford-Geiger tube, later to become the Geiger tube. 

In 1911 Geiger and John Mitchell Nuttall discovered the Geiger–Nuttall law (or rule) and performed experiments that led to Rutherford's atomic model. In 1928 Geiger and his student Walther Müller created an improved version of the Geiger tube, the Geiger–Müller tube. Geiger also worked with James Chadwick. In 1912 he became leader of the Physical-Technical Reichsanstalt in Berlin, 1925 professor in Kiel, 1929 in Tübingen, and from 1936 in Berlin.

He was a member of the Uranium Club. Geiger never expressed himself in public about the Nazis. There are reports both about him helping, and rejecting, Jewish colleagues. Geiger died in Potsdam, Germany a few months after World War II ended in Europe. He had four siblings: three sisters and one brother that were all younger than him.

She received her doctorate in physics from the University of Vienna in 1906. Her work with two other scientists influenced the discovery and creation of the atomic bomb.

Meitner was of Jewish descent and converted to Lutheranism.

Starting in 1907, Meitner worked with a man named Otto Hahn. She worked with Hahn throughout her entire career. Working together, they completed a lot of work in chemistry. Hahn won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, even though his work had been with her. The reason that she did not win the prize was that she was a woman. She did attend the ceremony though.

In 1914, Meitner volunteered as an X-ray technician in the Austrian army during World War I. Meitner was also the first female professor in Germany. She became a German professor in 1917. Throughout the 1920s, Meitner worked mostly on radiation. She won many prizes and awards. Around 1935, Meitner and Hahn worked together to learn more about uranium. The element Meitnerium is named after her. Later in Meitner’s life, she had many discoveries that led to the creation of the atomic bomb. She worked to make possible the atomic bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima but she did not agree the atomic bomb.

[[Hypatia]]

CATEGORIES: Greek scientists

Hypatia (hy-PAY-shee-uh) of Alexandria was a mathematician, astronomer, and philosopher. She lived around 370 - 415 C.E. Hypatia was the first noted women in mathematics, philosophy, and astronomy. She lead a philosophical movement called Neoplatonism. Neoplatonism was developed from the ideas of the ancient Greek philosopher Plato. 

Hypatia was born in Alexandria, a city in Egypt. During Hypatia’s time, Egypt was a great place for learning. Her father was also a mathematician, astronomer, and philosopher, so she had it in her blood line. Her father was Theon. Hypatia and her father worked on commentaries of Ptolemy's work together. Ptolemy was a Greek astronomer who was from Alexandria. Hypatia's name was also put on work done by other mathematicians. 

The Museum of Alexandria was a more like a university and library than a museum. It played a big role in education, and Hypatia’s life. Theon may have been the director of the museum at one point. Theon was interested in mathematics. This may have led Hypatia to pursue astronomy, mathematics, and philosophy.

Her skills were so notable, that she became the leader of the Neoplatonism movement in Alexandria around 400. Her reputation led students from all around the world to come visit here. She was recognized as a better philosopher than most of the men during her time. Hypatia gave lectures at her house and in lecture halls. She lectured on astronomy, mathematics, philosophy, and religious literature. She wrote a number of books about mathematics.

Synesius of Cyrene was a student of Hypatia. His letters provided some of the most important information on her life and her teachings. She taught Synesius about the building of an astrolabe.

Hypatia was never married because she said she was “wedded to the truth”. She was an acquaintance of Orestes. He was the pagan governor of Alexandria. Radical monks murdered her. They possibly murdered her because the pagans seemed to have caused enmity among the mainly Christian town. They persecuted her, and scattered her body parts around the city. She died at 45 years old, in 415 C.E.

[[Great spotted woodpecker]]

CATEGORIES: Piciformes

The great spotted woodpecker (Dendrocopos major) is a medium-sized woodpecker with black and white plumage and a red patch on the lower belly. Males and young birds also have red markings on the neck or head.

This species is found across Eurasia and parts of North Africa. It is usually resident, but in the north some migrate if the conifer cone crop fails.

Some individuals have recolonised Ireland and some have got to North America. Great spotted woodpeckers chisel into trees to find food or excavate nest holes, and also drum for contact and territorial advertisement. They have anatomical adaptations to manage the physical stresses from the hammering.

The bird occurs in all types of woodlands and eats a wide range of food. It gets seeds out of pine cones, insect larvae from inside trees, and chicks of other birds from their nests. It breeds in holes excavated in living or dead trees, unlined apart from wood chips. When the young fledge they are fed by the adults for about ten days.

[[Armistice of Villafranca]]

The armistice and preliminaries of Villafranca were signed on 11 July 1859 in Villafranca di Verona , in the Veneto , by France and Austria. It put an end to the Austro-Franco-Sardinian War which constitutes for Italy, the second Italian War of Independence.

After the difficult battles of Magenta (4 June) and Solferino (24 June), Napoleon III , without consulting his Sardinian ally Cavour , proposed the armistice on 8 July and an interview on 11 July with the Emperor of Austria François- Joseph I st. Although victorious, Napoleon III was frightened by the hecatomb (nearly 40,000 killed or wounded at Solferino) and the idea of having to continue an autumn and winter campaign against the Austrians entrenched in the quadrilateral. Moreover, the government and the Empress send him alarming information about the state of French opinion, Which is execrable. In particular, the Catholics, hitherto supported by the imperial regime, fear for the Papal States and the Pope's independence if Austria were eliminated from Italy. Finally, an anti-French feeling spread in Germany, where the Austrians were supported. The number of Prussian deaths is nearly 400 000 soldiers near the Rhine, stripped of French troops.

In Villafranca, it is agreed that Austria cedes Lombardy (except Mantua and Peschiera) to France, which restores it to the kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia. An Italian confederation under the presidency of Pope Pius IX was created, the Veneto under Austrian sovereignty being part of it. The dukes of Modena , Parma, and Tuscany, driven away by revolutions, found their thrones.

Cavour, not consulted, resigned on 10 July, while King Victor-Emmanuel II gave his agreement "in a personal capacity", thus leaving the door open to any governmental retraction.

These preliminaries were confirmed by the Treaty of Zurich of 11 November 1859.

[[Vijayalaya Chola]]

CATEGORIES: Tamil Monarchs

Vijayalaya Chola was a king of South India,  and founded the imperial Chola dynasty. He ruled over the region to the north of the river Kaveri River.The ancient Chola kingdom once famous in Tamil literature and in the writings of Greek merchants and geographers faded into darkness after c. 300 CE. Cholas during this period almost completely disappeared from their native land. They seem to have held on to their old capital city of Urayur. This 'dark' age of Tamil history came to an end with the ascendency of the Pandyas and the Pallavas. The Cholas had to wait for another three centuries until the accession of Vijayalaya in the second quarter of the ninth century to re-establish their dynasty.

At the time of 848 CE, there was a struggle or war between the Pallavas and Pandyas. Vijayalaya Chola used this as his own oppurtunity. He captured the Thanjavur region from Elango Mutharaiyars . In this disturbed state of affairs, Vijayalaya defeated the Pandyas, and made himself the ruler of Thanjavur and the surrounding Chola country. He also defeated the Pallavas. After Vijayalaya’s capture of Thanjavur, the Pandyan king Varagunavarman II (c. 862 – 885 CE) made alliance with the Pallava king Nandivarman III (c. 846 – 869 CE). Nandhivarman wished to destroy the growing influence of Chola power under Vijayalaya and called upon the Varagunavarman to help suppress Vijayalaya. Varaguna led an expedition into the Chola country. The Pandyan army reached the north bank of the Kaveri near Thanjavur. Vijayalaya, by this time was aging and was an invalid. The crown prince Aditya I took control of the army in the defence of the Chola kingdom. Vijayalaya was succeeded after his death c. 871 CE by his son Aditya I.

The Tiruvalangadu plates state that Vijayalaya captured the city of Tanjavur and made it his capital and that he also built in it a temple to the goddess Nisumbhasudani (Durga).  The Kanyakumari inscription states that he developed the city of Tanjore.Vijayalaya took the title of Parakesarivarman. Chola kings succeeding him took the titles of Parakesari and Rajakesari in turns. This is probably to acknowledge their ancestors Parakesari and Rajakesari.Narttamalai, Pudukkottai has a solesvara temple attributed to Vijayalaya.

Its membership was not restricted on the basis of religion, unlike the Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Jana Sangh. In 1960, Rajagopalachari and his colleagues drafted a 21-point manifesto detailing why Swatantra Party had to be formed, even though they were formerly Congressmen and associates of Nehru during the struggle for independence. The Prime Minister was highly critical of Swatantra, dubbing the party as belonging to "the middle ages of lords, castles and zamindars.

It is also the belief that sex and love between men and women is better than other types of sex and love. Heterosexism is not just something a single person can believe but is taught by society and culture. Heterosexist beliefs can cause people to act unfairly towards people who are gay, lesbian, bisexual, or asexual.

Heterosexism is related to homophobia and biphobia in the same way that sexism is related to misogyny and transphobia.

CATEGORIES: Judaism in Israel

The Sanhedrin was a group of judges who led the Jewish people of every city in the Land of Israel. Their name is Greek and means "council" or "assembly." There were between twenty-three and seventy-one judges in each Sanhedrin. According to the Hebrew Bible, God commanded Moses and the Israelites to make councils of judges and to do what they said.

The Great Sanhedrin in Jerusalem led the other councils. It met every day except on holidays and Shabbat. After the Romans destroyed the Second Temple, the Great Sanhedrin moved to Galilee. It made its last law in 358 CE when it abandoned the Hebrew calendar. It stopped meeting because of persecution. Some people have tried to bring it back, such as Napoleon Bonaparte. These attempts have not been successful so far.

[[1978 Sikh–Nirankari clashes]]

CATEGORIES: 1978 in Asia, Sikhism, 1970s in India

On 13 April 1978, a violent incident happened between the Sant Nirankari Mission and traditional Sikhs. This was at Amritsar, Punjab, India. Sixteen people were killed.

This incident eventually led to Operation Blue Star and the Punjab insurgency in the 1980s. Clashes occurred when Akhand Kirtani Jatha and Damdami Taksal members led by Fauja Singh protested against and tried to stop a convention of Sant Nirankari Mission followers. This incident is considered to be a starting point in the events leading to Operation Blue Star and the 1980s insurgency in Punjab. 

The turning point in the Sikh-Nirankari relationship is believed to have come after Avtar Singh took over as the sect chief in 1943. He not only proclaimed himself “Satguru” but also introduced a book “Avtar Bani” and allegedly tried to copy Sikh symbols like starting the system of Sat Piare etc. He was successful in organising Nirankaris into a powerful sect. However, in his book “A History of The Sikhs”, Khushwant Singh noted that the fundamental difference between both was that the Nirankaris were worshiping gurus other than the 10 recognised by the Sikhs.

However, the conflict reached its peak on April 13, 1978. Activists of the Akhand Kirtni Jatha and Damdai Taksal marched towards the venue of a Nirankari convention in Amritsar. It led to a clash that left at least 17 dead and a majority of them were Sikhs.

Following the deadly clash in 1978, Akal Takht issued a hukamnama asking Sikhs to sever ties with Nirankari Sikhs. Later in 1980 in Delhi, Akhand Kirtani Jatha’s Ranjit Singh killed Nirankari chief Gurbachan Singh. Ranjit Singh was later nominated as Akal Takht Jathedar.

[[Theodicy]]

CATEGORIES: Theology

Theodicy is a branch of theology that seeks to explain why a God that is seen as all-loving, all-seeing, and all-powerful allows evil to exist. The word comes from the Greek words for God and Judgment and so means the judgment of God. It was first made up  by the German philosopher Gottfried Leibniz in 1710 in his work Théodicée. The subject has been the focus of argument and thought for hundreds of years before that and since.

Theodicy tries to explain why God, who has complete free will, has the power to change anything he wants to, can see all the evil in the world and is all-loving and compassionate, yet does nothing to alleviate the suffering in the world, especially the suffering of innocents. 

The weakness of the arguments for Theodicy are  often used by atheists to emphasise the problems that go with the belief in God.

Medgar Wiley Evers (July 2, 1925spaced ndashJune 12, 1963) was an American civil rights activist from Decatur Mississippi.  He is best known for his work to overturn racial segregation in the United States in the 1950s and early 1960s. He was a World War II veteran. He became a field secretary for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). After the 1954 ruling of the United States Supreme Court in Brown v. Board of Education that segregated public schools were unconstitutional, Evers worked to get  African Americans admitted to the all-white University of Mississippi. He also worked for other changes in the nation's then-segregated society, such as voting rights and registration, economic opportunity, and access to public facilities for African Americans.

Evers was assassinated by Byron De La Beckwith, a member of the “White Citizens' Council, a group formed in 1954 to resist integration of schools and civil rights activity in America. His murder and the resulting trials led to many civil rights protests. An all-white jury failed to convict De La Beckwith in his first two trials. He was finally convicted, however, 30 years later in a new state trial in 1994 that was based on new evidence. Evers’ wife Myrlie Evers, later became a noted activist in her own right, serving as national chair of the NAACP. His brother Charles Evers became the first African-American mayor elected in the state of Mississippi in 1969 in Fayette, Mississippi.

[[Battle of Thebes]]

CATEGORIES: Ancient Greece, History of Greece

Thebes had been under Macedonian occupation since the battle of Chaeronea, which had resulted in the defeat and deposition of Thebes as the pre-eminent city-state of Southern Greece. The Thebans had reluctantly accepted this, as well as their compulsory membership in the League of Corinth, which had been previously imposed by Phillip II of Macedon, Alexander's father.

The expedition against Persia had been long in the works, and Alexander did not make it a secret that he planned to avenge the attacks on Greece by Persia a century and a half before, despite that at the time his kingdom had been a Persian vassal state. It was as a result of this planned expedition that King Darius III started to distribute money to the Greek city-states with the hope that they would rise against their new Hegemon. In addition to this, he had sent his most able general Memnon of Rhodes against the Macedonian troops that were already stationed in Ionia at this time.

In addition to this, news of Alexander had not reached the southern Greek city states for some time. He had been busy with the siege of Pelium and a rumour had reached them that he had died during the course of this siege. Demosthenes - a prominent Athenian politician - produced a man who claimed to have been present at the siege and claimed that Alexander was dead. Alexander had, indeed, been injured during this siege, so it was not a totally implausible claim to make.

Upon learning of the alleged death of Alexander, Theban exiles in Athens raced off to their native city in Boeotia and sought to incite a revolt from Macedonian rule there. The Cadmaea, the citadel that was situated upon a hill in Thebes, was occupied by a Macedonian garrison, and it was this place that the Thebans sought to attack. To this effect, they killed two Macedonian officers who had been roaming the city, and declared their independence from Macedonia.

[[Clothes iron]]

CATEGORIES: Home appliances

A clothes iron (also flatiron or smoothing iron) has a handle and a flat triangle shaped surface. Electricity makes the flat surface hot. A hot iron is rubbed on clothes to make them flat and smooth. This is called ironing. The handle does not get hot because that is where it is held. They are named clothes irons because they used to be made out of the metal iron.

Cloth is made from lots of small strings. When people wear clothes or move other things made from cloth, the little strings might bend and make lumps. Because the iron is heavy and hot when it is turned on, the little strings stretch and go flat when the iron is put on top. Different kinds of cloth need to be ironed in different ways. If the iron is too hot then the cloth might get broken or burn. If the iron is too cold then the strings might stay lumpy and not go flat. Sometimes people use water with an iron, which makes steam. This can make it easier to iron clothes because the small strings get soft. Some cloth does not need to be ironed because the strings always stays flat.

No one can agree why people iron clothes. Some people think wearing clothes that have been ironed shows they are not lazy. Other people think that not ironing clothes can make them look nicer.

[[Win–loss record (pitching)]]

CATEGORIES: Baseball rules

In baseball, a win–loss record shows the number of games that a pitcher has won and the number of games he has lost. In each game, one pitcher on the winning team is awarded a win (the "winning pitcher") and one pitcher on the losing team is given a loss (the "losing pitcher"). These pitchers are known as the pitchers of record. The awarding of a win or a loss for a pitcher is known as a decision, and only one pitcher for each team receives a decision in each game. A starting pitcher who does not receive credit for a win or loss is said to have no decision. In certain situations, another pitcher on the winning team who pitched in relief of the winning pitcher can be credited with a save, and holds can be awarded to relief pitchers on both sides, but these are never awarded to the same pitcher who is awarded the win.

There is no iron in ironstone. Its name is got because it is strong and durable. Ironstone was developed in the 19th century by potters in Staffordshire. It sold well as a cheaper alternative to porcelain.

Ironstone in Britain's Staffordshire potteries was made by Charles James Mason after his patent of 1813. The name "ironstone" later became generally used. The strength of Mason's ironstone enabled the company to produce ornamental objects of large size. Their vestibule vaseswere  1.5 metres high. Mantelpieces were made from several large sections. Mason's tableware was widely used in hotels and restaurants as well as private homes. It was usual for commercial clients to have the name of their establishment transfer printed onto the stoneware. 

Mason's was not the only manufacturer. Another high-class pottery was Spode, who made ironstone from 1805 onwards. They had big exports to France, where ironstone was often preferred to faience pottery.

During the mid-19th century The United states was the largest export market for Staffordshire's potteries. They bought plain white stoneware in huge quantities.

In 1987, he erected the Times Square Church, an independent and very succesful church in Manhattan, New York City.

Wilkerson wrote several Christian books, like the already mentioned The Cross and the Switchblade (1962) and the very impressive The Vision (1974). Last book and its successor (The Vision and Beyond, 2003) are dealing with divine prophecies about severe misconduct, problems and disasters the world is facing in the future (and already partly happening); he also revealed that the so-called "Number of the Beast" (Antichrist) will be composed of a combination of three times six numbers. He also wrote about other divine prophecies such as riots and arsons cities in the United States (especially New York City) but also worldwide are going to endure in the future because of their sinful behavior, and countries going bankrupt causing shopping and money problems worldwide.

David Wilkerson died as a result of a car accident in eastern Texas in 2011, aged nearly 80.

[[Caradoc]]

CATEGORIES: Fictional characters, Arthurian legend

Caradoc was a knight of the Round Table. He was raised as the son of Caradoc the Elder, the king of Nates. His mother had an affair with a sorcerer named Eliavres who was his real father. During a beheading game, he chopped off his opponents head. The corpse replaced the head and explained that he was Caradoc’s biological father. Humiliated, he took his father and locked him in a tower. While attempting to escape, the wizard made a serpent wrap itself around his son's arm. A witch persuaded Eliaures, who was a magician, to make the snake attach itself to Caradoc's arm, sucking his blood. His friend Cador saved his life by putting his sister Guimer in a vat of milk and Caradoc in a vat of sour wine. This got the snake to cross from one vat to the other, giving Cador the chance to kill it with his sword. The attack caused Caradoc’s arm to “shrivel away”, and he became known as Breifbras (little-arm). Later in life he married Guignier. Due to Caradoc’s mother’s infidelity, he was very paranoid and made his wife go through a chastity test while they were both in Camelot. She passed the test and the two were given the city of Cirencester as a reward.

[[Specific heat]]

CATEGORIES: Pages created with the Article Wizard from 2017

Specific heat (s) is a particular type of heat capacity. Specific heat is the thermodynamic property, which states the amount of heat required for a single unit of mass of a substance to be raised by one degree of temperature. Varying ranges of specific heat values are seen for substances depending on the extent to which they absorb heat. The term heat capacity can be misleading since heat q is the term given to the addition or removal of energy, across a barrier to a substance or system, as a result of increasing or decreasing the temperature respectively. Temperature changes are really changes in energy. Therefore, specific heat and other forms of heat capacity are more accurately measures of the capacity of a substance to absorb energy as the temperature of the substance increases.

[[IOS 11]]

CATEGORIES: Operating systems, IOS

Complex

iOS 11 is the eleventh major release of the iOS mobile operating system developed by Apple Inc., coming after iOS 10. It was announced at the company's Worldwide Developers Conference on June 5, 2017, and released on September 19, 2017.

Some of iOS 11's changes: the lock screen and Notification Center are combined, allowing all notifications to be displayed directly on the lock screen. The various pages of the Control Center are unified, gaining custom settings and the ability to 3D Touch icons for more options. The App Store receives a big visual change to focus on editorial content and daily highlights. A "Files" file manager app allows direct access to files stored locally and in cloud services. Siri can now translate between languages and use a privacy-minded "on-device learning" technique to better understand a user's interests and offer suggestions. The camera has new settings for better portrait-mode photos and will use new encoding technologies to reduce file sizes on newer devices. In a future release, Messages will be used with iCloud to better synchronize messages across iOS and macOS devices. A previous point release also added support for person-to-person Apple Pay payments. The operating system also introduces the ability to record the screen, limited forms of drag-and-drop functionality, and support for augmented reality. Certain new features will appear only on iPad, including an always-accessible application dock, cross-app drag-and-drop, and a new user interface to show multiple apps at once.

iOS 11 received mixed reviews. People significantly praised the application dock and new multitasking interface on the iPad, crediting them for renewing the user experience. Further praise was directed at the redesigned Control Center offering customizable toggles, though it was criticized for lack of third-party app support, lack of Wi-Fi network selection ability and for difficult usage on small screen sizes, along with its instability. People also noted the new augmented reality development tools, but said their impact would depend on third-party apps and how fast developers embraced them. Praise was also directed at the App Store's redesign and the new file-management tools. Shortly after release, it was discovered that disabling Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connections through the Control Center does not disable the respective chips in the device in order to remain functional for background connectivity, a design decision sparking criticism for "misleading" users and reducing security due to potential vulnerabilities in inactive open connections. The iOS 11.2 update added warning messages and a new toggle color to explain the new functions. iOS 11 has also received continuous criticism from reviewers and end-users for its perceived stability and performance issues, particularly on older devices; Apple has issued numerous software updates to address such issues. 

Two months after release, 52% of iOS devices were running iOS 11, a slower adoption rate than previous iOS versions. The number increased to 81% of devices by May 2018.

On June 4, 2018, at the Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple announced its successor, iOS 12.

[[Sphygmomanometer]]

CATEGORIES: Medical equipment, Physiology, Blood pressure

A sphygmomanometer ((ˌ, SFIG; also called a blood pressure meter, blood pressure monitor, or blood pressure gauge) is a device used to measure blood pressure in humans. It was first invented by an Austrian physician in 1881. They now come in different shapes and sizes. They can be found in many places.

The sphygmomanometer works by wrapping a tube of fabric (called a "cuff") around the arm or other body part. The cuff is filled up with air. That stops the flow of blood in the arm. The air is then released slowly until the blood flows again. The whole process, from start to finish, only takes about a minute.

Many sphygmomanometers are inflated by squeezing a bulb. A gauge shows how much the cuff is inflated. The gauge can be mechanical or hydraulic (filled with mercury).  It is important that the cuff is not inflated too much, so whoever is using the device has to use a stethoscope. 

Some sphygmomanometers, especially those that people use at home, are automatic. They inflate using an electric pump. They show the blood pressure on a screen. They are meant to be very easy to use.

[[Pinch hitter]]

CATEGORIES: Baseball rules, Baseball positions

In baseball, a pinch hitter is a batter in place of another batter. Batters can be substituted at any time while there is not an active play. The manager may use any player who has not entered the game. Unlike basketball, American football, or ice hockey, baseball does not have a "free substitution rule". The player replaced by the pinch hitter is never allowed back into that game. The pinch hitter takes the spot in the batting order of the player that he replaces.

The player chosen to be a pinch hitter is often a backup infielder or outfielder. Catchers are not usually pinch hitters because most teams only have two catchers. Pitchers are also not used very often as pinch hitters because they are not very good hitters.

The American League of Major League Baseball, the Pacific League in Japan, the KBO League in Korea, and other leagues use the designated hitter rule. The designated hitter bats for the pitcher but does not play defense.

[[Saint Lawrence Seaway]]

CATEGORIES: Water transport, Canals, Geography of North America

The Saint Lawrence Seaway is a navigable waterway in North America. It is 370 long and allows marine vessels to go from the Atlantic Ocean to all of the Great Lakes. Most of it is in Canada, but a small part of it is in the United States. It gets its name from the Saint Lawrence River, the river which goes from Lake Ontario to the Gulf of Saint Lawrence.

Before the Seaway was built, there was no way for boats and ships to get around the rapids and dams on the Saint Lawrence River. Big ships could not pass Niagara Falls, the waterfalls on the Niagara River between Lake Ontario and Lake Erie. In the early 20th century, the governments of both Canada and the U.S. saw that the cities near the Great Lakes could grow and become an important part of the economy of both countries. There were people in both countries who did not want the Seaway to be built, but the project went ahead.

In 1954, construction began on a system of canals from Montreal in the east to Port Colborne in the west. It included 15 locks where the water level changes, and several places where electricity could be made from the flow of water. The project also involved making the Welland Canal bigger so that large ships can pass through it.

The Seaway was completed in 1959 at a cost of C$470 million. Today, thousands of vessels use it every year, from small recreational boats to huge ocean liners. About 40 to 50 million tonnes of cargo are moved on these ships and they go to all parts of the world including Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. It has been an important part of the economic growth of cities like Toronto, Hamilton, Buffalo, Cleveland, Detroit, Milwaukee, and Chicago. There are plans to make the Seaway even wider so that container ships as big as those that travel through the Panama Canal can use it.

Medical cannabis can help with nausea and vomiting during chemotherapy. It can improve appetite in people with HIV/AIDS. It can reduce chronic pain and muscle spasms.

Short-term use makes it more likely that there will be side effects. Common side effects include feeling tired, dizziness and hallucinations. Long-term effects of marijuana are not clear. Concerns include memory problems, risk of addiction and children taking it by accident.

The Cannabis plant has been used as medicine for thousands of years in many cultures. Its current use is controversial.

Medical marijuana can be given in different ways. They include vaporizing, smoking dried buds, eating foods that have cannabis in them, taking capsules or using lozenges.

Recreational use of marijuana is illegal in most parts of the world. The medical use of cannabis is legal in some countries, including the Czech Republic, Canada, Austria, the Netherlands, Italy and Germany. Australia is working to pass a law that will allow the use of marijuana for medical and scientific purposes. In the United States, federal law says all use of marijuana is illegal.

[[Bus network]]

CATEGORIES: Networks

A bus network is an arrangement in a local area network (LAN) in which each node (workstation or other device) is connected to a main cable or link called the bus.

A bus network is simple and reliable. If one node fails to operate, all the rest can still communicate with each other. For a major disruption to take place, the bus itself must be broken somewhere. Bus networks are easy to expand. Additional nodes can be added anywhere along the bus.

There are several limitations to the bus network topology. The length of the bus is limited by cable loss. A bus network may not work well if the nodes are located at scattered points that do not lie near a common.

[[5-demicube]]

CATEGORIES: Geometry

In five-dimensional geometry, a demipenteract or 5-demicube is a semiregular 5-polytope, constructed from a 5-hypercube (penteract) with alternated vertices removed.

It was discovered by Thorold Gosset. Since it was the only semiregular 5-polytope (made of more than one type of regular facets), he called it a 5-ic semi-regular. E. L. Elte identified it in 1912 as a semiregular polytope, labeling it as HM5 for a 5-dimensional half measure polytope.

It exists in the k21 polytope family as 121 with the Gosset polytopes: 221, 321, and 421.

The graph formed by the vertices and edges of the demipenteract is sometimes called the Clebsch graph, though that name sometimes refers to the folded cube graph of order five instead.

Joseph Ritter von Fraunhofer (6 March 1787 – 7 June 1826) was a German physicist.

He was born in 1787 in a place called Bavaria. When he was 11 years old he had no father and no mother. Because of that, he had to work to survive. He worked making glass objects for a man called Philipp Anton Weichelsberger.

One day, in 1801, the place where Fraunhofer was working fell down and was destroyed. Fraunhofer was inside when this happened. Luckily, some people found him in the middle of the bits of the house and saved him. The prince of Bavaria was with these people and he decided to help Fraunhofer.

The prince decided to give Fraunhofer money and books to study. He studied for five years and one day he was invited to work for a man called Joseph Utzschneider. This man had a company that made glass lenses to be used in scientific instruments. And this company had a secret laboratory in a monastery called Benediktbeuern. In this laboratory people were trying to discover how to make better glass lenses. Glass lenses at that time was a very complicated technology. After three years, Fraunhofer was one of the directors of this company. And after eight years he was a partner of the owner.

[[Automation]]

CATEGORIES: Technology

In the context of engineering, automation is when a device or a machine is changed in such a way that it can fulfill the task it was designed for without the need of human interaction. Very often, this means that the machine is fitted with an additional system which takes control of its functions. For example, a centrifugal governor controls a steam engine.

Benefits of automation are that the output of the machine or device are more uniform, and that product quality is improved. A system that is not fully automated needs human interaction is needed: Many of the tasks involved are repetitive and boring. In general, machines are also designed so that humans no longer need to lift heavy weights or do dangerous things. With automation, human intervention is limited  or absent.

[[Roman citizenship]]

CATEGORIES: Ancient Rome

Client state citizens and allies (socii) of Rome could receive a limited form of Roman citizenship such as the Latin Right. Such citizens could not vote or be elected in Roman elections. Slaves were considered property and lacked legal personhood. Over time, they acquired a few protections under Roman law.The rights available to individual citizens of Rome varied over time, according to their place of origin, and their service to the state. They also varied under Roman law according to the classification of the individual within the state. Various legal classes were defined by the various combinations of legal rights that each class enjoyed. However, the possible rights available to citizens with whom Roman law addressed were:

The toga was the characteristic garment of the Roman male citizen, and statues of emperors (here Antoninus Pius) frequently depict them togate (togatus).

Ius suffragiorum: The right to vote in the Roman assemblies.

Ius gentium: The legal recognition, developed in the 3rd century BC, of the growing international scope of Roman affairs, and the need for Roman law to deal with situations between Roman citizens and foreign persons. The ius gentium was therefore a Roman legal codification of the widely accepted international law of the time, and was based on the highly developed commercial law of the Greek city-states and of other maritime powers.4 The rights afforded by the ius gentium were considered to be held by all persons; it is thus a concept of human rights rather than rights attached to citizenship.

Ius conubii: The right to have a lawful marriage with a Roman citizen according to Roman principles,5 to have the legal rights of the paterfamilias over the family, and for the children of any such marriage to be counted as Roman citizens.

Ius migrationis: The right to preserve one's level of citizenship upon relocation to a polis of comparable status. For example, members of the cives Romani (see below) maintained their full civitas when they migrated to a Roman colony with full rights under the law: a colonia civium Romanorum. Latins also had this right, and maintained their ius Latii if they relocated to a different Latin state or Latin colony (Latina colonia). This right did not preserve one's level of citizenship should one relocate to a colony of lesser legal status; full Roman citizens relocating to a Latina colonia were reduced to the level of the ius Latii, and such a migration and reduction in status had to be a voluntary act.

The right of immunity from some taxes and other legal obligations, especially local rules and regulations.6

The right to sue in the courts and the right to be sued.

The right to have a legal trial (to appear before a proper court and to defend oneself).Auxilia and gained citizenship through service.

[[Taliban insurgency]]

CATEGORIES: 21st century in Afghanistan, Insurgencies, Taliban

After the war in Afghanistan began in 2001, the Taliban started an insurgency, which is known as the Taliban insurgency. The Taliban started to attack the forces of ISAF and NATO, in Afghanistan, and committed many terrorist attacks.  In the conflict, the Taliban fight against the Afghan government and its allies. Al-Qaeda is linked to the Taliban. With this, the conflict in the region spread to Pakistan. The related conflict in Pakistan is the insurgency in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

Because Afghanistan has seen a number of conflicts and wars in recent decades, its economy has changed, and many people depend on growing cash crops, such as poppy seeds which are used to produce illegal drugs such as opium, or heroin. Many people in Afghanistan do not think the problems are caused by the Taliban. Resolving the problem will therefore probably involve more effort than winning against the Taliban. It will also mean that there need to be changes in the economy, and the way in which the country is run.

[[Pteropoda]]

CATEGORIES: Gastropods

Pteropods are free-swimming pelagic sea snails and sea slugs. They are marine opisthobranch gastropods.  

Are they a natural group? The monophyly of Pteropoda is the subject of debate.   At present, by molecular studies, the group is monophyletic.

Pteropoda has  two clades Thecosomata, the sea butterflies, and Gymnosomata, the sea angels. The Thecosomata have a shell, while the Gymnosomata  ("naked body") do not. The two clades may or may not be sister taxa. If not, their similarity  may reflect adaptation to their particular lifestyle.

All are pelagic, small, and transparent, and swim using wing-like flaps (parapodia) which protrude from their bodies.

The name "sea slug" is most often applied to nudibranchs, as well as to other marine gastropods without obvious shells.

[[Gambling addiction]]

CATEGORIES: Gambling, Addiction

A gambling addiction is when someone is obsessed with gambling despite the negative consequences. Gambling addictions often puts the person in risk of losing everything. People with this illness often think about suicide more than the general population. Many people use gambling as a way to get away from their terrible lives and to gain satisfaction. In many ways, gambling addiction is similar to other addictions (such as the addiction to alcohol or the addiction to illegal drugs).

Someone with a gambling addiction often

Gambling addiction is a serious disease difficult to overcome. In most cases, it is treated through therapy and counseling. In some cases, specific drugs can help. There is no definite cure. 

Research demonstrates how the brain can get addicted to gambling. There is also evidence older people are more likely to become gambling addicts.

Recently, the problem of gambling has become extremely important due to the ubiquitous distribution of cash slot machines, the opening of many casinos, as well as bookmakers (including online). All of them are beautifully designed, which enhances the suggestive effect of an easy winning opportunity in a short time and a constant desire to recoup and win more. Slot machines have long been widespread throughout the world. 

In the United States, according to R. Volberg (1996), the number of “problem players” - addictive gamblers so dependent on slot machines that their lives are completely subordinated to this passion - reaches 5% of the population. Data from other researchers (Ladouceur et al., 1999) indicate that in the first half of the 1990s alone, the number of problem players in Canada increased by more than 75%.

Covid-19 impacted gambling significantly. 68% of actively engaged gamblers have spent more money online since lockdown began. These frequent online gamblers are already vulnerable to addiction, and their behaviour in 2020 has been seriously impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. But, with 40% of the population experiencing a decrease in their disposable income, it’s possible that infrequent betters might look to online gambling as a quick solution for financial difficulty.

He also negotiated the marriage of princess Margaret of Valois, who was five years old at the time, with prince Sebastian of Portugal, who was six years old at the time.

When Nicot returned, he brought tobacco plants. He introduced snuff tobacco to the French royal court. In particular, he presented the queen mother, Catherine de' Medici, with tobacco leaves to cure her of her migraines. The plant was also an instant success with the Father Superior of Malta, who shared tobacco with all of his monks. More and more of the fashionable people of Paris began to use the plant, making Nicot a celebrity.At first, the plant was called Nicotina. But nicotine later came to refer specifically to the particular chemical in the plant. The tobacco plant, Nicotiana, also a flowering garden plant, was named after him by Carl Linnaeus, as was nicotine. Nicot described its believed medicinal properties (1559) and sent it as a medicine to the French court.For his service to the French royal court, Nicot was given the name 'de Villemain' and land near Brie-Comte-Robert. There, he compiled one of the first French dictionaries, Thresor de la langue françoyse tant ancienne que moderne (published in 1606).

It is mostly found more in women than in men. It is a disease  attributed  to  the  Celts, a  race  of  people   originally  found  in  northern  U K ,and  spread  from  Scotland  to  Ireland,the  Isle of Man, and  north  Wales ,and  now ,of course,  can  be  found  in  any  part   of  the  United  Kingdom ,even  to  the  extent  that  some  members only of a family  may  have  the  classical  signs  of a celt (  ginger hair, freckles,  blue  eyes ,   and   very  thin  skin  which  does not  take  a tan)  and    are  prone  to  complaints  which  show  poor  circulation.

Nothing  to  worry  about  ,though,  usually, but  it  can  become  more   of a  problem  as  people  age. Look  right  at   the   example  of it   and   it  is  clear, so  if  you   have  had   this   experience  then   have  a word with  your doctor ,some time.

[[Aortic dissection]]

CATEGORIES: Cardiology, Diseases

Aortic dissection occurs when a tear in the inside of the aorta causes blood to flow between the layers of the wall of the aorta, forcing the layers apart. In most cases this is associated with a sudden onset of severe chest or back pain, often described as "tearing" in character. 

Also, vomiting, sweating, and lightheadedness may occur. Other symptoms may result from decreased blood supply to other organs such as stroke or mesenteric ischemia. Aortic dissection can quickly lead to death as a result of not enough blood flow to the heart or rupture of the aorta.

Aortic dissection is more common in those with a history of high blood pressure, a number of connective tissue diseases that affect blood vessel wall strength such as Marfan syndrome, a bicuspid aortic valve, and previous heart surgery.

[[Cladding]]

Cladding is the application of one material over another to provide a skin or layer. This may be for protection against the weather, or it may be for aesthetic purposes.

Rainscreen cladding is one form of weather cladding: it is designed to protect against the elements, but also offers thermal insulation. The cladding does not need, itself, to be waterproof, merely a control element: it may serve only to direct water or wind safely away in order to control run-off and prevent its infiltration into the building structure. Cladding may also be a control element for noise: whether entering or escaping. Cladding applied to windows is often referred to as window capping and is a specialized field.

In the wake of the Grenfell Tower fire, in London, and similar fires, in France, Dubai and elsewhere, great attention has been paid to the fire protection qualities of cladding used in tower-blocks and similar high-rise multiple-occupancy housing and, in particular, the use of Aluminium Composite Material (ACM) and ACM panels (ACP).

[[Cerebral infarction]]

CATEGORIES: Heart disease, Medical emergencies

A cerebral infarction is an area of necrotic tissue in the brain caused from a blockage or narrowing in the arteries supplying blood and oxygen to the brain. 

The lack of oxygen due to the low blood supply causes an ischemic stroke that can result in an infarction if the blood flow is not restored within a relatively short period of time. The blockage can be due to a thrombus, an embolus or an atheromatous stenosis of one or more arteries. 

Which arteries are problematic will determine which areas of the brain are affected (infarcted). These varying infarcts will produce different symptoms and outcomes. About one third will prove fatal.

[[Paradigm]]

CATEGORIES: Philosophy

In philosophy of science, a paradigm is a way of thinking about a problem. The word comes from Greek παράδειγμα (paradeigma), "pattern, example, sample" from the verb παραδείκνυμι (paradeiknumi), "exhibit, represent, expose" and that from παρά (para), "beside, beyond" and δείκνυμι (deiknumi), "to show, to point out". Paradigm can also be used to refer to a set of ideas about a given subject. The idea that the Earth is the center of the universe, or that the Earth and other planets move around the sun are examples of paradigms. One of the first modern people to use the word was Georg Christoph Lichtenberg  (1742-1799), an 18th century mathematician and scientist.

In rhetoric, paradeigma is known as a type of proof. The purpose of paradeigma is to provide an audience with an illustration of similar occurrences. This illustration is not meant to take the audience to a conclusion, however it is used to help guide them there. A personal accountant is a good comparison of paradeigma to explain how it is meant to guide the audience. It is not the job of a personal accountant to tell their client exactly what (and what not) to spend their money on, but to aid in guiding their client as to how money should be spent based on their financial goals. Anaximenes defined paradeigma as, "actions that have occurred previously and are similar to, or the opposite of, those which we are now discussing." Aristotle uses the word in a similar way, in inductive logic. usually, induction is used to get from a number of special cases to a general one. Aristotle uses the word to get from one special case to another.

The original Greek term παράδειγμα (paradeigma) was used in Greek texts such as Plato's Timaeus (28A) as the model or the pattern that the Demiurge (god) used to create the cosmos. The term had a technical meaning in the field of grammar: the 1900 Merriam-Webster dictionary defines its technical use only in the context of grammar or, in rhetoric, as a term for an illustrative parable or fable. In linguistics, Ferdinand de Saussure used paradigm to refer to a class of elements with similarities.

[[Bruxism]]

Bruxism is the problem of too much tooth grinding or jaw clenching. It is not a normal use for teeth like eating or talking. Bruxism is a common problem that affects 8–31% of people. Bruxism can wear down teeth, make them too sensitive, and cause headaches and jaw pain. It can also harm dental work like crowns and fillings. Sometimes these problems are not noticed, so not everyone with bruxism knows they have it.

There are two main kinds of bruxism: sleep bruxism and awake bruxism. Sleep bruxism happens when the person sleeps, and awake bruxism happens when the person is awake. Symptoms of sleep bruxism are often worse when waking up. Awake bruxism can feel fine when waking up, then get worse as the day goes on. There may be many reasons why people grind their teeth and clench their jaws. Awake bruxism may have different causes from sleep bruxism. Females are more likely to have awake bruxism. Sleep bruxism affects males as often as females. Several treatments are used, but none are proved to be very effective.

CATEGORIES: Philosophy

An appeal to nature is an argument that says a thing is good because it is 'natural', or bad because it is 'unnatural'. It can be a bad argument for two reasons. First, not everyone agrees on what is "natural" or "unnatural". For example, eating meat is natural to some people and unnatural to others. Second, even if something is clearly natural or unnatural, that alone does not mean that the thing is good or bad. For example, many "natural" plants and animals are poisonous, but unnatural things like medicine and vaccines can be helpful against diseases.

A marriage proposal is when one person in a relationship asks the other person to marry them. If the other person agrees, this marks the start of the couple's engagement. A person in an engaged couple is called "fiance" (male) or "fiancee" (female).

In Western culture, it is traditional for the person proposing to be down on one bent knee. A traditional proposal might be worded "Will you marry me?" 

In many cultures, it is traditional for a man to ask a woman's father for permission to marry her. The father could say no if he thought the man was not right for his daughter, or if he didn't want him as a son-in-law. In the West today, it is more common for a couple to decide between themselves and then announce their decision to their parents. Instead of asking for permission, the couple may ask for the parents' approval or their blessing.

In the United States, about 5% of proposals are performed by women.
