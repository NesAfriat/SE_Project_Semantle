The Bulgars (also Bulghars, Bulgari, Bolgars, Bolghars, Bolgari, Proto-Bulgarians) were Turkic semi-nomadic warrior tribes that flourished in the Pontic–Caspian steppe and the Volga region during the 7th century. They became known as nomadic equestrians in the Volga-Ural region, but some researchers say that their ethnic roots can be traced to Central Asia. During their westward migration across the Eurasian steppe, the Bulgar tribes absorbed other ethnic groups and cultural influences in a process of ethnogenesis, including Indo-European, Finno-Ugric and Hunnic tribes. Modern genetic research on Central Asian Turkic people and ethnic groups related to the Bulgars points to an affiliation with Western Eurasian populations. The Bulgars spoke a Turkic language, i.e. Bulgar language of Oghuric branch. They preserved the military titles, organization and customs of Eurasian steppes, as well as pagan shamanism and belief in the sky deity Tangra.

[[Venceremos]]

Venceremos (pron. benseˈɾ​emos "ben-seh-REH-mohs"; en. 'We Shall Prevail', also 'We Shall Overcome', lit. 'We Will Win') is a Chilean political movement song that was the anthem for the Popular Unity of Chile. Originally popularized by Chilean groups Inti-Illimani and Quilapayún, it was a song to propagate the nueva canción movement in Chile at the time, and to support Salvador Allende during the 1970 Chilean presidential elections. The original lyrics were written by Claudio Iturra and the music was composed by Sergio Ortega. To further support the left-wing party and Allende in the 1970 elections, the lyrics were rewritten by Víctor Jara – with the mentioning of Allende and the Popular Unity in the lyrics – so thus a second version came about which then became the anthem for the Popular Unity movement in 1970.

This song became popular in the 1970s and has been translated into Portuguese, Italian, Russian, German, and Turkish; however, the authors of the former three remains unknown.

The George Floyd protests are ongoing protests and riots that started in the Minneapolis–Saint Paul metropolitan area, Minnesota, United States. Unrest began in Minneapolis on May 26, 2020, after the murder of George Floyd and continued into September. Floyd died while being arrested by officers of the Minneapolis Police Department (MPD) on May 25. Protests spread to many cities in the United States, and later the world.

Some of the protesters at the MPD's Third Precinct fought with law enforcement officers, who fired tear gas and rubber bullets. On May 27, one man was shot at a pawn shop and died. Witnesses recall hearing him say "George is a monkey!" Additionally, the Third Precinct's windows were smashed. A supermarket was looted, and other buildings were attacked and set on fire. At least thirteen people were killed so because of the protests, but overall, most protests were peaceful. According to a September 2020 report by the U.S. Crisis Monitor, almost 95% of all protests were nonviolent.

On May 28, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey declared a state of emergency, and Governor of Minnesota Tim Walz called in 500 Minnesota National Guard troops. More businesses across the Twin Cities were damaged and looted. 

MPD in the Third Precinct building attempted to hold off the protesters with tear gas, but around 11:00 pm, protesters overran the building and set it on fire. It had been evacuated. 

Both Walz and Frey added curfews. U.S. President Donald Trump assured Walz of U.S. military support.

The activist group Black Lives Matter is involved in the protests, but the protests do not have one leader or one organization.

There were many attacks on journalists, both in the Twin Cities and at sister protests.

[[Run (cricket)]]

CATEGORIES: Cricket

There are many versions of cricket. In general, cricket uses runs for scoring. In most cases, the team with the most runs wins the game.  One run 

(known as a "single") can be scored after the bowler, who is in one batsman's ground, has thrown the ball to the batsman in the other ground. That batsman (known as the "striker") can hit the ball away from the fielders. Both the striker and the non-striker then run the length of the pitch, 22 while running to the other ground.  They will cross each other. To complete a run, both batsmen must "make their ground", meaning some part of their person or held bat touches the ground behind the crease (line) at the other end of the pitch. If the wicket in either ground is knocked off by a fielder with the ball when no batsman is in that ground, then the ball becomes dead and one of the batsmen (usually the one nearest to that ground) is run out of the game for the rest of the innings.

The batsman is given four runs if the ball rolls along the ground and hits the boundary. They are given six runs if the ball crosses the boundary while in the air and then touches the ground, similar to a home run in baseball.

When it takes longer to recover the ball, the batsmen may run several times and score many runs.

The total score is gotten by adding up all runs.

The People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) is the military of modern-day Vietnam. It was also the military of communist North Vietnam during the First Indochina War and the Vietnam War. Non-communist fighters called it the Viet Minh during the First Indochina War and the North Vietnamese Army (NVA) during the Vietnam War. The NVA is not to be confused with the Viet Cong because the Viet Cong were South Vietnamese who fought for North Vietnam. During the Vietnam War, the NVA made a system of trails (mostly in Laos and Cambodia) called the Ho Chi Minh Trail. This was made to send NVA soldiers into South Vietnam and to give Viet Cong support to fight against non-communist soldiers.

Later in the war, the United States would secretly send US soldiers to fight communist Vietnamese soldiers in Laos and Cambodia.

In early 1971, South Vietnam–with United States support–tried to disrupt the Ho Chi Minh Trail by invading Laos and launching Operation Lam Son 719, but this operation was a failure.

[[Fourier series]]

CATEGORIES: Mathematical analysis

Joseph Fourier said that it is possible to use sine waves to approximate another function. This is a series in the mathematical sense. This theory can be generalized to the Fourier transform. Mathematical analysis of these functions is called Fourier analysis. 

In the 18th century, mathematicians such as Euler, Lagrange and Bernoulli already used sinusoids to approximate and model other functions. When Fourier published a work on heat, in 1822, he said that such approximations exist for any such function (that is continuous in the interval). At first, people didn't believe him, and it took almost ten years for a proof (of part of the problem) to appear.

Today, fourier series are used a lot in digital signal processing.

[[Hick's law]]

CATEGORIES: Psychology

Hick's law, or the Hick–Hyman law is named after British and American psychologists William Edmund Hick and Ray Hyman. It describes the time it takes for a person to make a decision as a result of the possible choices.

Increasing the number of choices increases the decision time logarithmically. The amount of time taken to process a certain amount of bits in the Hick–Hyman law is known as the rate of gain of information.

Hick's law may support some computing menu design decisions. For example, to find a given word (e.g. the name of a command) in a randomly ordered word list (e.g. a menu). If the list is alphabetical, and the user knows the name of the command, he or she may be able to use a subdividing strategy that works in logarithmic time.

CATEGORIES: Frogs, Animals of Australia

The motorbike frog, also called Moore's frog, western green and golden bell frog, and bull frog (Litoria moorei), is a frog from southwestern Australia.

These frogs can be up to 7.8 cm long.  They can come in different colors from brown to green and parts of their skin turn yellow if they sit in the sunlight. They have light green or light brown bellies. They have a stripe over each eyelid that goes past the ear to the top of the front leg.

They lay their eggs in bunches stuck to plants under water.  The tadpoles can be 8 cm long and are dark brown.  They grow into frogs in March and April, late summer.  Some tadpoles stay tadpoles longer, for 14 months and can grow to be 14 cm long before turning into frogs.

The tadpoles eat algae and the adults eat arthropods, such as insects, and sometimes young motorbike frogs.

Although this frog can climb trees, it mostly lives on the ground, so not all scientists call it a tree frog.

[[Norilsk]]

CATEGORIES: Siberia, Cities in Russia

Norilsk is a city in Siberia, with almost 180,000 people. It lies about 300 north of the arctic circle, and over  1500 north of Krasnoyarsk.  There are many ore deposits in the region, especially nickel and copper. Mining ore is always linked to heavy pollution of the environment. Norilsk was founded in 1935 as a site of industry, to be able to mine the ore. In 1939, the decision was taken to also build a city. Norilsk got the statute of a city in 1953.

Norilsk is the northernmost city with more than 100.000 inhabitants. It is the second largest city within the arctic circle, only Murmansk is larger. Norilsk and Yakutsk are the only large cities built in the continuous permafrost zone. This means that even in summer, the ground remains frozen.

The nickel deposits of Norilsk-Talnakh are the largest-known nickel-copper-palladium deposits in the world.  The smelting of the nickel ore is directly responsible for severe pollution, which generally comes in the form of acid rain and smog. By some estimates, one percent of global sulfur dioxide emission comes from Norilsk's nickel mines.

Norilsk is a closed city. This means that a special permit is needed to be able to travel to Norilsk. This permit is  issued both by the Russian government, and the local mining comany. Foreigners usually do not get this permit.

[[Bon]]

CATEGORIES: Religion in China, Tibet

Bon, also spelled Bön, is a religion of Tibet. The modern form of Bon has its roots in the late 900s and 1000s CE, when the first Bon monasteries were started in Tibet. There are many teachings in Bon that are similar to Buddhist teachings, and so people who study Bon disagree whether it should be called a kind of Buddhism or not. Followers of Bon believe that it was founded by a teacher called Tonpa Shenrab who lived many years ago in a land called Tazig. Some people think that Tazig refers to Persia, Central Asia, or the area around Mount Kailash in western Tibet. According to Tibetans, Bon was popular in Tibet before Buddhism became the main religion of Tibet, but some non-Tibetans like Per Kvœrne say there isn't much connection between religion in Tibet before Buddhism and the living tradition of Bon. After the Chinese army sent troops to Tibet in 1959, some followers of Bon were forced to leave Tibet and many Bon monasteries and temples were shut down. Many of the followers of Bon who left Tibet started Bon centers in cities around the world. Today, most people who believe in Bon are ethnic Tibetans, but a small number of non-Tibetans have started to believe in Bon too. 

The yungdrung, or left-facing swastika, is a sacred symbol in Bon, and the living tradition of Bon is sometimes called Yungdrung Bon, meaning "eternal Bon" in Tibetan. The yungdrung, like the vajra in Tibetan Buddhism, represents eternity because it is said that the yungdrung cannot be destroyed and lasts forever. 

Tibetan Buddhists used to write many bad things about Bon, arguing that Bon had stolen most of its teachings from Buddhism, a view that people studying Bon from Europe and North America sometimes agreed with. The fourteenth Dalai Lama, who is seen as a religious leader by most Tibetans, said that Bon is as much part of Tibetan religion as Buddhism, encouraging people to treat Bon with respect. 

Followers of Bon are called Bonpos. Bonpos believe in many gods. These gods include the creator god, Sangpo Bumtri, the god of compassion Shenlha Ökar, the goddess of compassion Sherab Chamma, and the founder of Bon Tonpa Shenrab.

[[False vacuum]]

CATEGORIES: Physics

A false vacuum is an idea from theoretical physics: In quantum field theory, such a vacuum might exist for a very long time, before it changes its state. Much like with a true vacuum, a false vacuum exists where the energy is minimal. In the case of a true vacuum, this is at a global minimum of the energy function. With a false vaccum, the energy function is only at a local minimum. As is illustrated in the figure, there is a "peak" between the local minimum and the global minimum of the energy function. 

The process by which the system changes its energy state is called bubble nucleation: Somewhere in the universe, a bubble will appear, with a lower energy state inside the bubble. This bubble will then spread and change the energy state of its surroundings.

[[Triangle Shirtwaist Company fire]]

On March 25, 1911 a fire broke out in the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory  which was located on floors 8, 9 and 10 of the Asch Building at 23–29 Washington Pl, Manhattan,  New York City. The fire stopped after 20 minutes but 146 workers died.

The company's owners, Max Blanck and Isaac Harris, who survived the fire by going to the building's roof when the fire started, were indicted on charges of first- and second-degree manslaughter in mid-April; the pair's trial began on December 4, 1911. Max Steuer, counsel for the defendants, managed to destroy the credibility of one of the survivors, Kate Alterman, by asking her to repeat her testimony a number of times, which she did without altering key phrases. Steuer argued to the jury that Alterman and possibly other witnesses had memorized their statements, and might even have been told what to say by the prosecutors. The prosecution charged that the owners knew the exit doors were locked at the time in question. The investigation found that the locks were intended to be locked during working hours based on the findings from the fire, but the defense stressed that the prosecution failed to prove that the owners knew that. The jury acquitted the two men of first- and second-degree manslaughter, but they were found liable of wrongful death during a subsequent civil suit in 1913 in which plaintiffs were awarded compensation in the amount of $75 per deceased victim. The insurance company paid Blanck and Harris about $60,000 more than the reported losses, or about $400 per casualty.In 1913, Blanck was once again arrested for locking the door in his factory during working hours. He was fined $20 which was the minimum amount the fine could be.

Because of the lax labor laws at the time, this tragedy paved the way for the rise of factory workers safety protections and the formation of workers Unions such as the International Ladies Garment Union.

CATEGORIES: July 2014 events, August 2014 events, Pacific typhoons

Hurricane Genevieve, also known as Typhoon Genevieve, was a strong and long-lived tropical cyclone that became the fourth-strongest tropical cyclone of the 2014 Pacific typhoon season. It was also the first tropical cyclone to exist in all the three North Pacific tropical cyclone basins since Dora in 1999. Genevieve formed from a tropical wave well to the south-east of Hawaii on July 25, but weakened quickly into a remnant low due to high wind shear on July 28. The system briefly reformed on July to the south of Hawaii before dissipating once again on July 31. 

Several days later, on August 2, Genevieve regenerated. Owing to better conditions for intensification, Genevieve began to rapidly intensify, reaching hurricane strength on August 6 and major hurricane strength on August 7 shortly before crossing the International Date Line into the Western Pacific basin, where Genevieve was reclassified as a typhoon by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA).

After reaching peak intensity as a Category 5 typhoon on August 7 and 8 to the west-southwest , Genevieve began to weaken as conditions worsened. The storm rapidly weakened to severe tropical storm strength on August 10. On August 12, the JMA downgraded Genevieve to a tropical depression, and Genevieve dissipated on August 14.

[[Rapture (BioShock)]]

CATEGORIES: Video games

Rapture is a fictional city where the BioShock series of video games takes place. The city was built at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean so that no government could find it. Rapture is a city based on the ideas of objectivism, the philosophy that believes everything people do should be based on logic (rather than emotion) and for their own self-interest. 

Rapture was built by a man named Andrew Ryan. Andrew Ryan believed that the governments and religions above the ocean wanted to take away the wealth from people who worked hard for it and to give it to so-called "parasites", people who take away things from people who worked for it. He wanted Rapture to be a place where people could become anything or do anything they wanted if they worked hard for it, a place where science could develop quickly because religions could not enforce morality to slow down or stop scientific research, a place where artists could make any art they wanted because governments could not censor their ideas, a place where rich and powerful people would not be forced to give anything to poor and powerless people.

Due to not having laws that slowed down or stopped scientific research, many intelligent scientists from above the ocean moved to Rapture and made many new discoveries. This allowed Rapture to develop very quickly. The most important discovery is the discovery of ADAM. ADAM is a liquid that comes from sea slugs that can rewrite a person's genetic code. This allows people to have special powers like shooting lighting bolts, shooting fire, and lifting objects without touching them. However, ADAM was also extremely addictive, and if users of ADAM went through long periods of time without it, they would suffer serious health problems and go insane. People who got withdrawals from ADAM would turn into Splicers. Unfortunately, many people in Rapture also became addicted to ADAM, and ADAM became something everyone in Rapture wanted and needed. Since ADAM had such a high demand and low supply, young girls called Little Sisters were raised to collect ADAM from dead Splicers. As Splicers would try to kill Little Sisters to take the ADAM they collected, Big Daddies were created to protect the Little Sisters. Big Daddies would kill anyone who attacked a Little Sister.

However, when the wealth gap between the rich and poor people of Rapture became too wide, Frank Fontaine, also known as Atlas, sold ADAM and made charities to help the poor people of Rapture. Also, since the economy of Rapture is based on laissez-faire captalism (an economy where governments make as little changes to the economy as possible), businesses could sell ADAM to people without any laws stopping it. Since Atlas was giving help and selling ADAM to the poor people of Rapture, they would become loyal to him. Since Atlas was gaining power and tried to control Rapture, Ryan betrayed the values he built Rapture on and became a dictator. Eventually, a civil war in Rapture was fought between people who supported Ryan and people who supported Atlas. This made Rapture a very dangerous place. Many people left Rapture to go back to the surface world. Most of the people who stayed in Rapture became Splicers.

[[Brahmanda Purana]]

CATEGORIES: Hinduism

The ''Brahmanda Purana'' is one of the oldest Puranas. Estimates for the composition of its earliest core vary widely. The early 20th-century Indian scholar Dikshitar dated the Brahmanda to 4th-century BCE. Most later scholarship places this text to be from centuries later, in the 4th- to 6th-century BCE. The text is generally assumed, states Ludo Rocher, to have achieved its current structure about 1000 CE.

The text was often changed after the 10th-century, and new sections probably replaced older ones. The 13th-century Yadava dynasty scholar Hemadri quoted large parts of the then existing Brahmanda Purana, but these parts are not found in currently surviving versions of the same text. This suggests that the 13th-century version of this Purana was different in many respects than extant manuscripts.

The Adhyatma-ramayana, the most important embedded set of chapters in the extant versions of the Purana, is considered to have been composed centuries later, possibly in the 15th-century, and is attributed to Ramananda – the Advaita scholar and the founder of the Ramanandi Sampradaya, the largest monastic group in Hinduism and in Asia in modern times. The Adhyatma-ramayana thus was added to this Purana later, and it is an important document to the Rama-related tradition within Hinduism.

A Javanese Brahmanda palm-leaf manuscript was discovered in Indonesia in the mid-19th century by colonial-era Dutch scholars, along with other Puranas. The Sanskrit originals of these are either lost or yet to be discovered. The Javanese Brahmanda was translated by the Dutch Sanskrit scholar Jan Gonda and compared to Sanskrit texts found in India.

[[Green and golden bell frog]]

CATEGORIES: Animals of Australia, Frogs

The green and golden bell frog (Litoria aurea) is a frog from Australia, but it also lives in New Zealand as an invasive specie.

Male adult frogs can be 5.7 to 6.9 cm long.  Female adult frogs can be 6.5 to 10.8 cm long.  These frogs are green with bronze spots. They have black stripes from their noses over their ears and down their bodies.  Their bellies are white and parts of their legs can be bright blue.  These frogs have teeth.

Green and golden bell frogs do not climb well.  They like to live near permanent bodies of water and temporary bodies of water that have no fish in them.  Adult frogs eat anything they can, even other green and golden bell frogs.

The frogs lay 3000-10,000 eggs at a time. At first, the eggs float together on top of the water, but then they sink.  The tadpoles eat algae, bacteria and dead things.

There used to be so many green and golden bell frogs that people would catch them to feed to snakes or to use in school dissection classes.  By the 1990s, there were fewer green and golden bell frogs.  Scientists say this is because of habitat fragmentation, which means people building things in between places where the frogs live, and because of invasive species such as the mosquito fish that eat green and golden bell frog tadpoles.

In 2000, people building tennis courts for the 2000 Summer Olympics saw green and golden bell frogs nearby, so they stopped building.

This frog is an invasive specie in New Zealand.  In the 1860s, the Auckland Acclimatisation Society released the frog in New Zealand on purpose.  The frogs on the South Island all died because the weather was not good for them.  Today, it lives on New Zealand's North Island.

The Kimberly rockhole frog (Litoria aurifera) is a small frog from northern Australia. It lives in the Kimberly area.  It was first found in the Prince Regent River by two plant scientists.

Adult frogs are about 2.2 cm long.  They live in rockholes and streams with rocky bottoms.  They are so small and light that they can skip across the top of the water like a skipping stone.

They lay 60-110 eggs at a time, in different places instead of large groups of eggs like other frogs.  The tadpoles have dark black bodies and tails with bright gold spots.  They eat algae and their mouths have suckers so they can hold onto rocks in fast streams.  They are about 1 cm long when they become frogs.

The Latin name aurifera means "carrying gold."

[[Beck's tree frog]]

CATEGORIES: Animals of Oceania, Frogs

Beck's tree frog (Ranoidea becki) is a large tree frog from Papua New Guinea.

Adult frogs are about 3.4 to 4.4 cm long.  They are dark green or dark brown in color with darker spots and stripes.  When dead frogs are saved for study, they have a white spot on their lip, but living frogs do not have this spot.

These frogs live high in the mountains and people have found them 3200 meters above sea level.  They live in or near bogs in grassy places.  They lay eggs underneath rocks.  Scientists do not know what the tadpoles look like.

As of the 2010s, scientists had only found this frog in five places.  They were places where human beings do not often go, so human activity does not bother these frogs.  They are dying because a sickness that affects frogs and other amphibians, chytridiomycosis, has spread to their mountains.

Rayshard Brooks, a 27-year-old African American man, was shot and killed by a white police officer in Atlanta, Georgia, United States, on the evening of June 12, 2020. 

Brooks was drunk and resisted arrest. He wrestled on the ground with two police officers, one of whom tased him. Brooks stole a taser from one of the officers, then fired the taser at one of them as he ran away. The same officer then shot Brooks in the back with his sidearm.

Video of the incident went viral. Atlanta chief of police Erika Shields resigned the next day. 

Protesters later burned down the Wendy's where the shooting had taken place.

One of the officers, Garrett Rolfe, was placed on administrative duty, meaning office work instead of going out into public spaces, and later fired.  In mid-June, Rolfe was charged with eleven crimes, including felony murder and aggravated assault.  If a jury convicts him, Rolfe could spend life in prison or even be executed. The other officer, Devin Brosnan, was charged with aggravated assault.  The court issued arrest warrants for both men.  They were told to turn themselves in by Thursday night, June 18. Brosnan and Rolfe both came to court.  Brosnan was charged and then released on bail. The judge said Rolfe's crime was too serious for him to grant bail right away, so Rolfe was put in Gwinnett County Jail, and his bail hearing was scheduled for Tuesday, June 23.

CATEGORIES: Anthropology, Humans, Race, Ethnic groups

Some scientists spoke of three races of mankind: The Caucasian race living in Europe, North Africa and West Asia, the Mongoloid race living in East Asia, Australia, and the Americas, and the Negroid race living in Africa south of the Sahara. Other scientists had different ideas and spoke of four or five races. These ideas were popular from the late 18th century to the middle of the 20th century. Because these ideas belong to former times, they are called historical definitions of race or historical race concepts.

Today, scientists agree that there is only one human race. Modern genetic research has shown that the idea of three (or four, or five) races was wrong.360

The exception to this was the municipality of Saint John which was not in a parish but was a sub-division of Saint John County.

With the New Brunswick Equal Opportunity program in 1966, county councils were shut down.  Counties continue to be used as an organizational unit, along with parishes, for registration of real-estate and its taxation. They figure prominently in residents' sense of place and continue as significant threads in the Province's culture (i.e., most citizens always know which county they are in). They still appear on most maps.

Harriet Jacobs (February 11, 1813 – March 7, 1897) was an African American in the 19th century. She was born as a slave in North Carolina, but learned to read and escaped to the North in the 1842.

When she was still a girl, her master wanted to start a sexual relationship with her. She refused and entered into a relationship with Samuel Tredwell Sawyer. Sawyer was a lawyer and had some power to protect her. He became the father of her two children, Joseph and Louisa Matilda. Still, the law gave a master absolute power over a slave. Jacobs's master wanted to sell her children away from her. In 1835, she decided to hide in a small room in her grandmother's house. That room was so small that she could not stand up. She had to stay there for seven years. Because she could neither stand nor walk, she was suffering from leg problems for many years afterwards. In 1842, she was finally able to escape to Philadelphia by boat. From Philadelphia, she went to New York where she found work as a nanny for the children of Nathaniel Parker Willis. Also her brother John S. Jacobs and her children were able to escape from slavery.

While she was still working as nanny for the Willis children during the day, at night she wrote down her experiences. In January 1861, her experiences were finally published as a book called Incidents in the Life of Slave Girl, written by herself. After the American Civil War had started in April 1861, she went to Alexandria, Virginia. There she helped black people who had just escaped from slavery. She spent her last years in Washington, D.C. where she lived together with her daughter.

After the Civil War, the slaves were set free. The people of the United States lost interest in slavery and forgot Jacobs and her book. But in the second half of the 20th century, people began to show new interest in the history of slavery. Professor Jean Fagan Yellin did a lot of research work and wrote the book Harriet Jacobs. A Life. The Remarkable Adventures of the Woman who Wrote Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl. Today, people call Jacobs's book an "American classic", meaning that it is one of the most important books written in the United States of America.
