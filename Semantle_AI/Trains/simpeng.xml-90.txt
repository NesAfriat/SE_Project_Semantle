Association Trio (asotsirebuli trio, asotsirebuli trio; Trio Asociat; Asotsiiovane Trio) is a tripartite format for enhanced cooperation, coordination and dialogue between the Ministries of Foreign Affairs of Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine, the three EU Associate Partners, and the European Union on issues of common interest related to the European integration of states, including cooperation in the framework of Eastern Partnership for the sake of joining the European Union.

The participants of the format express a clear position of the aspiration of the three European states of the "Associated Trio" for membership in the European Union and reaffirm their commitment to further progress in implementing the Association Agreements with the EU, which, however, is not the ultimate goal of their relations with the EU. In this context, they recall that under Article 49 TEU, European countries, Georgia, the Republic of Moldova and Ukraine have a European perspective and can apply for membership of the European Union, provided that all the necessary criteria for EU membership are met.

Coordinating their actions, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine seek to expand the possibilities of association agreements, promote sectoral convergence with the EU (integration into the Digital Single Market, energy and customs union, ENTSO-E, and, of course, with the Schengen Area; transport cooperation, green course, justice and home affairs, strategic communications, health, security and defense) and gradual integration into the European Single Market.

[[Medicine in the American Civil War]]

CATEGORIES: Medicine, American Civil War

Medicine in the American Civil War was not good by today's standards.  Doctors did not know about germs, so many soldiers caught infections.  They did have anesthesia, so they were able to stop soldiers' pain. Most doctors in the United States had two years of schooling.  Harvard Medical School did not have even one microscope.

One problem was that, like in World War I, people had just invented new weapons, like the Minié ball.  Guns with rifled barrels did not miss as often as the muskets from the Revolutionary War and other earlier wars did.  That meant doctors did not already know how to treat the injuries that these weapons could cause in the human body.  Another problem was that the camps and battlefields were very dirty.  A soldier in the American Civil war was twice as likely to die of disease as of a battle injury.

[[Breakthrough infection]]

CATEGORIES: Immunology

There are diseases where there are vaccines. In most cases, people who are vaccinated will no longer get the disease. In some cases, people who have been vaccinated will still catch the disease they have been vaccinated against. This is known as breakthrough infection. In some cases, vaccines do not provide immunity against the pathogen. Breakthrough infections have been described for diseases such as mumps, varicella (chicken pox), and influenza. As the person has been vaccinated, the disease will look different, in most cases: Usually, the symptoms will be milder, and it may not last as long (compared to someone who has not been vaccinated, and who naturally contracted the disease).

There are different causes for breakthrough infections: The vaccine may not have been stored properly, or there may have been an error, when the person was vaccinated. Viruses change over time. The vaccine may have been developed for another version of the virus, and it may not be as effective against the current version. Also, antibodies may block the vaccine.  

For these reasons, vaccines are not 100% effective: The common flu vaccine is estimated to provide immunity to the flu in 58% of those vaccinated. The measles vaccine fails to provide immunity to 2% of children that receive the vaccine. However, if herd immunity exists, it typically prevents individuals who are ineffectively vaccinated from contracting the disease. Accordingly, herd immunity reduces the number of breakthrough infections in a population.

In April 2021, the CDC reported that in the United States there were 5,814 COVID-19 breakthrough infections, and 74 deaths, among the more than 75 million people fully vaccinated for the COVID-19 virus.

The 1976 Tangshan earthquake (c=唐山大地震) was a natural disaster resulting from a magnitude 7.6 earthquake that hit the region around Tangshan, Hebei, People's Republic of China on 28 July 1976. It lasted for 23 seconds and leveled 90 percent of Tangshan’s buildings. The earthquake came during the heat of midsummer, and many stunned survivors crawled out of their ruined houses naked, covered only in dust and blood. The earthquake started fires and ignited explosives and poisonous gases in Tangshan’s factories. Water and electricity were cut off, and rail and road access to the city was destroyed. 

At the 3:42 a.m., an earthquake measuring between 7.8 and 8.2 magnitude on the Richter scale flattens Tangshan, a Chinese industrial city with a population of about a million people. The Chinese State Seismological Bureau (SSB) Analysis and Prediction Department was very accurate with the prediction of the earthquake, with an estimate of a major earthquake in the Tangshan region between July 22 and August 5. Despite voicing concerns, the prediction was not taken seriously. A few counties that listened to the advised saved thousands of lives by evacuating to safer areas days before the earthquake occurred.

[[Conservative wave]]

CATEGORIES: 2010s in South America, Politics of South America

The conservative wave (Spanish: ola conservadora Portuguese: onda conservadora) or blue tide is a conservative political happening that started in the mid-2010s in Latin America. It was a reaction to the pink tide.

After 10 years of left-wing government, the influence of the left began to decrease. In Argentina the conservative Mauricio Macri took the place of the Peronist Cristina Fernández de Kirchner in 2015. In Brazil there was Dilma Rousseff, who was impeached with Michel Temer taking her job in 2016. In Peru the conservative economist (person who studies economics) Pedro Pablo Kuczynski took the job of the President before him, Ollanta Humala. In Chile, the conservative Sebastián Piñera took the job of socialist Michelle Bachelet in 2018. In 2018 Jair Bolsonaro was elected President of Brazil, and in 2021, the conservative banker Guillermo Lasso was elected President of Ecuador.

These events in Latin America are similar to other happenings around the world, such as the election of Donald Trump as President of the United States in 2016. The increase of evangelicals in Latin America may have helped start up the conservative wave.

The Palaeognathae, or paleognaths (from Ancient Greek palaió- "old" + gnáthos "jaw") is one of two living clades of birds: the other is the Neognathae. Together, the two clades make up the clade Neornithes. 

Palaeognathae includes five living branches of flightless birds (plus two extinct clades), called ratites, and one flying lineage, the Neotropic tinamous. 

Recent research has shown that palaeognaths are monophyletic but the traditional taxonomic split between flightless and flighted forms is incorrect. Tinamous are within the ratite radiation. Flightlessness arose independently a number of times by parallel evolution.

There are three extinct groups that are undisputed members of Palaeognathae: the Lithornithiformes, the Dinornithiformes (moas) and the Aepyornithiformes (elephant birds).

[[Bugchasing]]

CATEGORIES: HIV/AIDS

Bugchasing is trying to get HIV through sex. People who try to get HIV are called bugchasers, and they are all men who have sex with men. It is not entirely understood why people try to get HIV, and bugchasing actions are hard to understand. It is rare.

== Motivation and action == 

Bugchasers are men who have sex with men and purposely try to get HIV. It is not understood why this happens. 

There are four common explanations.

First, it is thought that some men become bugchasers because they fear HIV infection, which had previously changed how they have sex. This can include things like men abstaining from sex entirely, only having sex with one person, or using sexual protection like condoms.

 Second, some men think having HIV is sexy. This means it can feel good to think about it, or that it is the ultimate taboo to overcome.

Third, bugchasers might think having HIV makes them part of a group.

And fourth, bugchasing might be an action against heteronormativity, the idea that everyone is heterosexual. The idea is that bugchasers do not achieve some expectations placed on them, including safe sex.

 There is a fifth possible reason—suicide—but this is not clear or very helpful.

Either way, people only rarely call themselves bugchasers, and they only try to get HIV even more rarely. This behavior does not entirely fit in with their identity.

 This means that bugchasing actions are rarely based on persons known to have HIV and having sex with them. Instead, a lot of bugchasers have sex in ambiguous situations, where they do not know if their partners have HIV.

 In 2005, researchers said there was no empirical evidence that bugchasing existed; they said that bugchasing as an idea and an activity existed, but it was rare.

Resistance to diversity casting was expressed by  'Time Out ' magazine with regard to 'Mother Courage', "the casting only inspires a whole host of irreverent questions: what on earth, say, is an American sergeant doing in seventeenth century Europe? And how did a Pakistani chaplain get into the Swedish army?" The Pakistani actor referred to was the  Asian Parsi actor Renu Setna. The Financial Times questioned 'Liolà'`s  multi-national casting "do we really need this peculiar medley of Italian accents for the English premiere? The problem is compounded by the commitment ... to a multi-national cast ... English, German, Sicilian, and Italian actors produce widely differing versions of the Latin lilt".

[[Turaco]]

CATEGORIES: Birds

a family of birds

The turacos make up the bird family Musophagidae (ˌ "banana-eaters"), which includes plantain-eaters and go-away-birds. In southern Africa both turacos and go-away-birds are commonly known as loeries. They are semi-zygodactylous: the fourth (outer) toe can be switched back and forth. The second and third toes, which always point forward, are conjoined in some species. Musophagids often have prominent crests and long tails; the turacos are noted for peculiar and unique pigments giving them their bright green and red feathers.

Traditionally, this group has been allied with the cuckoos in the order Cuculiformes, but the Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy raises this group to a full order Musophagiformes. They have been proposed to link the hoatzin to the other living birds, but this was later disputed. Recent genetic analyses have strongly supported the order ranking of Musophagiformes.

Musophagidae is one of very few bird families endemic to Africa. Another order, which is also endemic to Africa are the mousebirds, Colliidae.  All turaco species are frugivorous, but they also eat leaves, buds, and flowers. Figs are an important part of their diet. They have rounded wings and long tails and strong legs, making them poor fliers, but good runners.

Turacos are medium-sized arboreal birds endemic to sub-Saharan Africa, where they live in forests, woodland and savanna.

They are gregarious, non-migratory birds which move in family groups of up to 10. Many species are noisy, with the go-away-birds being especially noted for their piercing alarm calls, which alert other fauna to the presence of predators; their common name is onomatopoeia of this. Musophagids build large stick nests in trees, and lay twp or three eggs. The young are born with thick down and open, or nearly-open, eyes.

Mohammad Sidique Khan (20 October 1974 – 7 July 2005) was the oldest of the four Al Qaeda suicide bombers in the 7 July 2005 London bombings, in which bombs were exploded on three London Underground trains and one bus in central London suicide attacks, killing 56 people including the attackers and injuring over 700. He was believed to be the leader of the bombers. Khan bombed the Edgware Road train killing himself and six other people.

On 1 September 2005, a recording was found that had Khan in. The recording, shown by Al Jazeera Television, also mentions Ayman al-Zawahiri, who is the highest leader of al-Qaeda. The two men do not appear together, and the British government says that al-Qaeda was not involved with the bombing. The Home Office believes the recording was edited after the suicide attacks and dismisses it as evidence of al-Qaeda's involvement in the bombing. In the film, Khan declares, "I and thousands like me have forsaken everything for what we believe" and refers to his expectation that the media would already have painted a picture of him in accordance with government "spin". He goes on to say, "Your democratically elected governments continually perpetrate atrocities against my people all over the world. Your support makes you directly responsible. We are at war and I am a soldier. Now you too will taste the reality of this situation."

[[Anastasia (daughter of Constantius I)]]

CATEGORIES: Roman people

Anastasia (310s) was a Roman woman of the Constantinian dynasty (a line of rulers who governed the Roman Empire during Late Antiquity). Anastasia was the daughter of the Roman emperor ConstantiusNbspI, the half-sister of the emperor Constantine the Great, and the wife of Bassianus.

Anastasia's mother was Flavia Maximiana Theodora, the wife of Constantius I. (It is also possible that Anastasia was the daughter of Helena, mother of Constantine I, and not a daughter of Maximiana Theodora.)184120-121

Anastasia was written about by the Roman historian Ammianus Marcellinus and the writer of the Anonymus Valesianus, a Latin history. The Notitia Urbis Constantinopolitanae says that Roman baths in Constantinople (the Romans' capital city) had Anastasia's name. Anastasia's name (resurrection) may mean that her father had sympathy for Christian or Jewish culture.

There is no evidence that any of Constantius's daughters married before their father died. Anastasia's sister Constantia may have been the first to marry, and may have been the oldest of the siblings. Constantia married in 313. Anastasia herself married Bassianus in 316 or in 314. At that time, Anastasia's half-brother Constantine was emperor. He planned to make Bassianus none (a junior co-emperor). Anastasia's brother-in-law Licinius (Constantine's junior co-emperor) did not want this to happen, and Bassianus did not become none. After this Constantine executed Bassianus. The Anonymus Valesianus says that Bassianus's execution was because Bassianus planned treason. What became of Anastasia is unknown. The encyclopaedia Brill's New Pauly says that Anastasia "must have still been alive" when Constantine built the city of Constantinople, because of the Roman baths there with her name (Thermae Anastasianae).

In the 5th century, the Greek historians of Socrates Scholasticus and Sozomen both wrote that the none got their name from another Anastasia, a daughter of the emperor Valens. This information is not correct.

[[White stork]]

CATEGORIES: Birds of Africa, Birds of Europe, Birds of Asia, Ciconiiformes

The white stork (Ciconia ciconia) is a large bird in the stork family, Ciconiidae. Its plumage is mainly white, with black on the wings. Adults have long red legs and long pointed red beaks, and are on average 100 from beak tip to end of tail, with a 155 wingspan. 

The two subspecies, which differ slightly in size, breed in Europe (north to Finland), northwestern Africa, southwestern Asia (east to southern Kazakhstan) and southern Africa. 

The white stork is a long-distance migrant. It winters in Africa from tropical Sub-Saharan Africa to as far south as South Africa, or on the Indian subcontinent. When migrating between Europe and Africa, it avoids crossing the Mediterranean Sea and detours via the Levant in the east or the Strait of Gibraltar in the west, because the air thermals on which it depends for soaring do not form over water.

A carnivore, the white stork eats a wide range of animal prey, including insects, fish, amphibians, reptiles, small mammals and small birds. It takes most of its food from the ground, among low vegetation, and from shallow water. 

Though monogamous, the birds do not pair for life. Pairs build a large stick nest, which may be used for several years. Each year the female may lay a clutch of four eggs, which hatch roughly 33–34 days after being laid. Both parents take turns incubating the eggs, and both feed the young. The young leave the nest 58–64 days after hatching, and are fed by the parents for another 7–20 days.

Tutankhamun's trumpets are a pair of trumpets which were found in the burial chamber of the Eighteenth Dynasty Pharaoh Tutankhamun. One of the trumpets is made of sterling silver and the other is made of bronze or copper. Both trumpets are seen as the oldest working trumpets in he world. They are also the only trumpets known from  ancient Egypt.

When he excavated Tutankhamun's tomb, Howard Carter found the trumpets. The bronze trumpet was found in a large chest, that contained various military objects and walking sticks. The chest was in the antechamber of the tomb. The silver trumpet was found in the burial chamber. Both trumpets are engraved, they show images of  gods Ra-Horakhty, Ptah and Amun.  The silver trumpet's bell is engraved with many  sepals and calices representing a lotus flower, and the praenomen and nomen of the king. The bronze trumpet may in fact be made of copper; the metal has not yet been analysed. Similar looking trumpets feature in Egyptian wall-paintings that are usually, though not always, associated with military scenes.

After they had been silent for more than 3.000 years, the trumpets where used before an audience of about 150 million listeners through an international BBC broadcast aired on 16 April 1939. James Tappern of Prince Albert's Own 11th Royal Hussars regiment played the trumpets. The recording was recently featured, and can be heard on the BBC Radio 4 program Ghost Music. Rex Keating, who presented the 1939 broadcast, later claimed that during a rehearsal, the silver trumpet shattered, and Alfred Lucas, a member of Carter's team who had restored the finds, was so distressed he needed to go to hospital. Due to their fragility, it is unlikely the trumpets will be played again in any official musical reconstructions.

Apple Daily (蘋果日報) was a Traditional Chinese tabloid-style newspaper in Hong Kong in publication from 1995 to 2021. It was founded in 1995 by Jimmy Lai. It was once one of the best-selling Chinese language newspapers in Hong Kong. 

On 24 June 2021, the newspaper was forced to shutdown for violating a national security law. 

In June last year, Beijing implemented a sweeping new security law - despite much criticism and protest. The law gives Beijing powers to shape life in Hong Kong it has never had before. Critics say it effectively curtails protest and freedom of speech, though China has said it will return stability. Just months after the law was implemented, Lai and a handful of other media figures and activists were arrested and the Apple Daily officers were raided. Police also detained its chief editor and four other executives. The freezing of company accounts meant the paper no longer had money to pay its staff and run daily operations.

[[1940 United States presidential election]]

CATEGORIES: 1940s in the United States, Franklin D. Roosevelt, United States presidential elections

The 1940 United States presidential election happened during World War II but before the United States began fighting in it.  Franklin Delano Roosevelt was already president, and he was running for reelection.  Republican Wendell Willkie ran against him. It was the 39th presidential election in United States history.  This was the only time anyone has ever been elected to a third term as President of the United States.

Franklin was not sure whether he wanted to run for president again.  He waited to see what would happen with the war in Europe.  Then he decided he wanted to run.  At the Democratic convention in Chicago, Franklin Roosevelt's wife, Eleanor Roosevelt, gave a speech to the party, and they chose him to run.  Franklin Roosevelt chose Secretary of Agriculture Henry Wallace to run with him for Vice President.  This was the first time a presidential candidate had chosen his own running mate instead of letting the party choose.

The Republican Party chose Wendell Willkie.  Willkie had run an electric company.  He had liked the New Deal until Roosevelt made the Tennessee Valley Authority, which sold people cheap electricity.  Willkie traveled to 31 states by train.  In his campaign, he told voters he would keep most New Deal programs and talked about how anyone having a third term as president would be bad. "If one man is indispensable, then none of us is free," he said.

Roosevelt won with 54% of the popular vote.  That means 54% of the voters in the United States voted for him. He won 449 out of 531 electoral college votes. Wilke lost with 48% of the popular vote.

[[Protective hairstyle]]

CATEGORIES: Hairstyles

A protective hairstyle is a way of putting human hair so that it will not break or become dirty.  Most of the time, when people talk about protective hairstyles, they mean natural African hair.  A protective hairstyle tucks the ends of the hair into a braid, twist, or other shape so that they do not show.  This stops the hair from moving, which makes it less likely to break or wear out.

According to hair artist and author Jennifer Lord, protective hairstyles keep hair from being too dry.  They also make it so the person does not have to brush or move the hair as often.

Kugelblitz drives have been considered as possible future black hole starship engines.

A man-made kugelblitz would be made with a gamma-ray laser 1 billion times stronger than the current hypothesized ones. Also, it would have to produce a pulse that was 100 billionth of the current duration of a modern laser's pulse. A single pulse would equate to the energy produced by the sun in 1/10 of a second.

A kugelblitz of this size would last five years, and a device similar to a Dyson sphere could be constructed around it to use the energy produced by the Hawking radiation.

Members with his immediate family, and his family friend, Kevin Harris, also resisted. The Hostage Rescue Team under the Federal Bureau of Investigation got involved after the siege developed.

When the Marshals Service explored the Weaver property, six U.S. Marshals encountered Harris and Sammy Weaver (Randy's 14-year-old son) in the woods near the family cabin. A shootout then took place. Deputy U.S. Marshal William Francis Degan, Sammy Weaver and the Weavers' family dog Striker were killed.

[[Eminent domain]]

CATEGORIES: United States law, United Kingdom law, Social sciences, Legal terms, International law, Controversies

Eminent domain (the United States or the Philippines), also known as a compulsory purchase or acquisition (the Republic of Ireland, United Kingdom, New Zealand and Australia) is the power of the national government, province or state to take private properties for public use. It does not include the power to take and transfer the ownership of private properties from one owner to another without a valid public purpose.

The most common uses of property taken under eminent domain were for roads, government buildings and public utilities. In the mid-20th century, a new application for eminent domain was pioneered, under which the government could take the property and transfer it under a private third party. This was initially only done to properties that were deemed "blighted" or called a "development impediment", on the principles that such properties had negative impacts against the owners of surrounding properties.

[[Whale vocalization]]

CATEGORIES: Animal communication, Cetaceans

Whale sounds (or vocalization) are used by whales for communication.  Whales can make different kinds of sounds, including growling and singing. The song of whales is a regular sound made by some whales (for example, baleen whale). Humpback whales make long, complicated songs. Some whales can sing and some cannot.

Scientists are not sure what the songs do.  Whales as young as one month old make some songs.  Among humpback wales, the male adults sing much more than other whales do, so scientists think it might be males competing for mates.

Unlike humans, whales do not pass air through vocal cords to make sounds.  Bubbles do not rise up from a whale as it makes sounds.  Some scientists think whales push air through holes inside their heads, called sinuses.  They push the air across tissue called "phonic lips" or "vocal folds."

Due to their life in the water, whales and other marine mammals are very dependent on acoustic communication.

[[Languages of the Philippines]]

CATEGORIES: Languages of the Philippines

The Phiilippines are a group of islands between Malaysia and Taiwan. Many different groups of people live on the Philippines. Between 120 and 187 languages are spoken on the Phiilippines. For over three centuries, the Philippines were a colony of Spain. Amongst others, the Spanish introduced free public schools, which taught in Spanish. For a long time, the United States controlled the Philippines, so English is also commonly understood. In 1935, both English and Spanish were national langues. In the 1970s, when the Phliipppines had become independent, Spanish was dropped as an official language, and standarized version of Tagalog, called Filiipino was added. The 1987 constitution designates Filipino, a standardized version of Tagalog, as the national language and an official language along with English. Fililipino serves as a lingua franca. It allows people from different language families to communicate.'''' On October 30, 2018, President Rodrigo Duterte signed into law Republic Act 11106, which declares Filipino Sign Language or FSL to be the country's official sign language and as the Philippine government's official language in communicating with the Filipino Deaf.

Filpino is used in everyday life, and when people from different language groups want to communicate. The government operates mostly using English. Including second-language speakers, there are more speakers of Filipino than English in the Philippines. The other regional languages are given official auxiliary status in their respective places according to the constitution but particular languages are not specified. Some of these regional languages are also used in education.

The indigenous scripts of the Philippines (such as the Kulitan, Tagbanwa and others) are used very little; instead, Philippine languages are today written in the Latin script. Before they became independen in 1946, the Philippines had been a Spanish and an United states colony. Baybayin, though generally not understood, is one of the most well-known of the Philippine indigenous scripts and is used mainly in artistic applications such as on the Philippine banknotes, where the word "Pilipino" is inscribed using the writing system. Additionally, the Arabic script is used in the Muslim areas in the southern Philippines.

CATEGORIES: July 2021 events

An extreme heat wave has affected much of Western North America in late June and early July of 2021. The heat has affected Northern California, Idaho, Western Nevada, Oregon, and Washington in the United States, as well as British Columbia, and, later, Alberta, Manitoba, the Northwest Territories, Saskatchewan, and Yukon, all in Canada. 

It resulted in some of the highest temperatures ever recorded in the region, including the highest temperature ever measured in Canada at 49.6 °C (121.3 °F), as well as the highest temperatures in British Columbia, in the Northwest Territories, and Washington.

The heat wave has caused many huge wildfires, some reaching hundreds of square kilometers in area, which have led to widespread disruption on the roads. One of them largely destroyed Lytton in British Columbia, the village where the record-high temperature for Canada had been set. The heat also caused damage to the road and railway infrastructure, forced closures of businesses, disrupted cultural events and caused widespread melting of snow on the mountains, some of which resulted in flooding.

The exact death toll is unknown, and growing. On July 6, 2021, preliminary statistics released by the British Columbia Coroner Service suggested 579 more sudden deaths than usual happened there. Deaths in the United States include at least 107.

[[Honorific]]

CATEGORIES: Styles (manners of address)

An honorific is a title that shows esteem, courtesy, or respect for position or rank. It is used when addressing or referring to a person. Sometimes, the term "honorific" is used in a more specific sense to refer to an honorary academic title.

In the world of the past honorifics were highly visible. The difference between "Miss" and "Mrs" was fundamental in British social life (and, with variations, throughout Europe). It was not voluntary: you did not write a letter to a female without using the correct prefix.

Technical prefixes could be tricky. What do you do if the recipient has several positions or degrees? In German, you would list them all: Herr Dr. Dr. Professor Professor (then addressee's surname). In English, the postscript Esq., for "Esquire" was usually added for a man.

If the person used the prefixes to refer to himself, that was regarded as low behaviour, egotistical. The one exception was the medical doctorate in the UK. A medical doctor could described himself as Dr. Brown, and he would be understood as being a medic. There were originally no PhDs awarded in British universities, and they were uncommon until after the Second World War. Civil servants signed letters "Your obedient servant" to emphasize their intermediate role between government and the people, or between Parliament and the people.

It is obvious that the Church and the Armed Forces have honorifics of their own. If, as in the Armed Forces, the use of honorifics is compulsory, are they really honorifics? Similarly with the Royal Families. Compulsory honorifics have been going out of favour. They can be enforced in some cases, but the tendency is to drop them in informal life.

[[Baybayin]]

CATEGORIES: Languages of the Philippines, Writing systems

Baybayin is a script which was used in the Middle Ages on the island of Luzon (today part of the Philippines). It is a syllabic script. Baybayin was used for Tagalog, Ilocano, and Pangasinan. It had already been in use in the 12th century, and was widely used before the Spanish colonial era (which started in the late 16th century). Baybayin is an abugida - every letter is a consonant. Spanish misssionaries used Baybayin to spread the Christian faith. The book Doctrina Christiana, en lengua española y tagala was one of the first Christian books printed, in 1592. The book is written in Tagalog, using Baybayin, and Spanish, using the Latin alphabet.

Each Baybayin letter is a consonant, forming a syllable ending in 'a', by default. To make syllables ending differently, a small symbol is added above the letter (to make it end in 'e' or 'i'), or below the letter, to make the syllable end in 'o' or 'u'. See how the symbol is used below:

This symbol is called kudlit, and is not used for vowels at the beginning of a word, which have their own letters. 

The Hanunuo, Buhid, and Tagbanwa scripts resemble Baybayin, and are still in use today. 

Today, there's an Unicode block for the Baybayin letters (called Tagalog).

Baybayin started to disappear in the 17th century. There was still poetry written in Baybayin until the 18th century. Today, most Philippine languages use the Latin script.

[[Influenza vaccine]]

Influenza vaccines, also known as flu shots or flu jabs, are vaccines that protect against infection by influenza viruses. New versions of the vaccines are developed twice a year, as the influenza virus rapidly changes. While their effectiveness varies from year to year, most provide modest to high protection against influenza. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that vaccination against influenza reduces sickness, medical visits, hospitalizations, and deaths. Immunized workers who do catch the flu return to work half a day sooner on average. Vaccine effectiveness in those over 65 years old remains uncertain due to a lack of high-quality research. Vaccinating children may protect those around them.

Vaccination against influenza began in the 1930s, with large-scale availability in the United States beginning in 1945. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines.

The vaccines are generally safe; fever occurs in five to ten percent of children vaccinated, and temporary muscle pains or feelings of tiredness may occur. In certain years, the vaccine was linked to an increase in Guillain–Barré syndrome among older people at a rate of about one case per million doses. Although most influenza vaccines are produced using egg proteins, they are still recommended as safe for people who have severe egg allergies, as no increased risk of allergic reaction to the egg-based vaccines has been shown for people with  egg allergies. Vaccines produced using other technologies, notably recombinant vaccines and those based on cell culture rather than egg protein, started to become available from 2012 in the US, and later in Europe and Australia. Influenza vaccines are not recommended in those who have had a severe allergy to previous versions of the vaccine itself. The vaccine comes in inactive and weakened viral forms. The live, weakened vaccine is generally not recommended in pregnant women, children less than two years old, adults older than 50, or people with a weakened immune system. Depending on the type they can be injected into a muscle, sprayed into the nose, or injected into the middle layer of the skin (intradermal). The intradermal vaccine was not available during the 2018–2019 and 2019–2020 influenza seasons.

[[Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children]]

CATEGORIES: COVID-19 pandemic, Children

A systematic review indicates that children having COVID-19 have milder effects and better outcomes than many adults. Children, however, are more likely to have multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, a rare though life-threatening illness. This condition involves persistent fevers and extreme inflammation after being exposed to SARS-CoV-2, a virus that causes COVID-19.

Children and adolescents may be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in several other areas. Those are education, socioeconomic status and mental health.

When children and adolescents are infected with COVID-19, they are more likely to not show symptoms or usually have mild to moderate severity. Children and adolescents are not as likely to go to a hospital as adults. Some children, however, develop severe illness. In these cases respiratory support, like a ventilator, may be needed.

Children and adolescents are far less likely to die than people under other age groups.

[[Holocaust trivialization]]

CATEGORIES: World War II

Holocaust trivialization is the use of the word holocaust in a way that decreases the percieved size or importance of the Holocaust: the genocide of six million European Jews during World War II.

Originally, the word used to mean a (religious) sacrifice that is burnt completely to ash, but gained a new meaning something along the lines of "the large-scale destruction of a group of humans or animals" at some point during the late 19th century. For example, in 1915 the Armenian Genocide was described as a holocaust by many people of the time.

These usages are seen as offensive by many authors and scholars. Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel has said that the word has become too trivialized, using examples like news networks talking about the defeat of a sports team, or the murder of six people, and calling it a holocaust.

[[Sindu desh]]

CATEGORIES: Pakistan

Sindu desh (or Sindhudesh)  is the idea that the region of Sindh should have more autonomy from Pakistan. People who support the idea either want a state that is totally independent from Pakistan, or that is still part of Pakistan, but has more autonomy. The first who proposed this was  Ghulam Murtaza Syed (1904-1995). At first, Syed liked the idea of Pakistan, a state for all Muslims. Later he joined the opposition; he thought that the Paistani government betrayed the inhabitants of Sindh. In 1971, there was a war, that ended with East Pakistan becoming independent (and calling itself Bangladesh). After that war, Syed put forward his proposal of an independent Sindh, which he called Sindhudesh. Even though the movement exists, it wasn't able to gather a huge following. This is partly due to how the state of Pakistan is organised. There were protests however: These focused on the use of Urdu, instead of the Sindhi language. They also protested against the dominance of Bhan chod. These people were Indian Muslims, who emigrated to Pakistan. They mostly speak Urdu.

[[Ageusia]]

CATEGORIES: Medical signs, Health problems

Ageusia is the loss of taste functions of the tongue, particularly the inability to detect sweetness, sourness, bitterness, saltiness, and umami (meaning "pleasant/savory taste"). It is sometimes confused with anosmia – a loss of the sense of smell. Because the tongue can only feel texture and differentiate between sweet, sour, bitter, salty, and umami, most of what  we think of as the sense of taste actually comes from smell. Ageusia is a lot rarer than hypogeusia – a partial loss of taste – and dysgeusia – a distortion or change of taste.

[[Cuban art]]

CATEGORIES: Art, Cuban culture

Cuban art has been known since the 16th century.

In the 16th century, painters and sculptors began arriving from Europe. They made decorations (including paintings and sculptures), in Cuban churches and public buildings. By the mid-1700s, native-born artists were painting in Cuba, in the European tradition of painting.

Many works of art were left behind by José Nicolás de la Escalera (d. 1804). For many of those works, there is proof that he was the one who painted those.

Vicente Escobar (d. 1834) was a mestizo, and he did portraits that made his paintings popular with Cuba's elite (or people with wealth or political power). He opened first, or one of the first painting workshop/studios in Cuba. He later graduated from the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando in Madrid.

Víctor Patricio de Landaluze (d. 1889) was a Spanish-born artist, and he was an early artist of the costumbrismo genre. He was opposed to Cuban independence, and that cost him some of his popularity with the public.

Johann (Georg) Andreas Stein (16 May 1728 in Heidelsheim – 29 February 1792 in Augsburg), was a maker of keyboard instruments from Germany. He was building organs, clavichords, harpsichords and pianos.  

In the beginning Stein learned the craft from his father in Heidelsheim. In 1748 to 1749 he was visiting two different workshops: one of Johann Andreas Silbermann in Strasbourg and the other of Frantz Jacob Spath in Regensburg. Later Stein played an important role in the history of piano and was responsible for the design of the Viennese hammer action. In 1777 Stein met Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart for the first time. The composer used Stein's pianos in his public performances in Augsburg later that year.  He was fond of Stein's pianos and shared his admiration in a letter to his father. 

Only a few instrument by Stein survived until the XXI century. One clavichord that was bought by Leopold Mozart is now displayed in the Budapest National Museum. Instruments from Stein serve as models for such piano builders like Philip Belt and Paul McNulty.

CATEGORIES: Birmingham, Neighborhoods

Selly Oak is a mostly factory and home filled area in south-west Birmingham, England. Selly Oak ward, named after the area, has the neighbourhoods of: Bournbrook, Selly Park, and Ten Acres inside it. The nearby areas of Edgbaston and Harborne are to the north of the Bourn Brook, which was the former county borders, and to the south are Weoley, and Bournville. A local government is in-charge the four wards of Selly Oak, Billesley, Bournville and Brandwood. The same areas make the Birmingham Selly Oak political constituency, with their MP being Steve McCabe of the Labour Party. Selly Oak is connected to Birmingham by the Pershore Road (A441) and the Bristol Road (A38).

The 2001 Population Census found that there were 25,792 people who lived in Selly Oak, with a population density of 4,236 people per km2 which was sometimes compared with 3,649 people per km2 in Birmingham. 15.9% of the population were people from races that had smaller populations in the UK compared with 29.6% in Birmingham. As the University of Birmingham is nearby, there are many students who live in the area. This can damage the figures about population that use the election registered voter record because some students are not allowed to vote, and some who are allowed do not register to vote.

[[Tirey Lafayette Ford]]

Tirey Lafayette Ford (December 29, 1857 – June 26, 1928) was an American lawyer and Republican politician who served as a California State Senator and the 18th Attorney-General of California. He acted as General Counsel for the United Railroads in San Francisco.

Ford was born on a farm in Monroe County, Missouri, the son of Jacob Harrison Ford and Mary Winn Abernathy. He went to the district county school from 1863 to 1873 and graduated from high school in 1876.

In 1877, at the age of 19, Ford left Missouri and took an immigrant train to Colusa County, California. For three years, he worked on his uncle Hugh J. Glenn's ranch; Hugh Glenn was a Democratic candidate for Governor. Ford became a student in the law office of Colonel Park Henshaw in Chico, California. Ford was admitted to the California bar in August 1882.

In 1882, Ford moved to Oroville to practice law in partnership with Senator Albert F. Jones, under the firm name of Jones & Ford. This partnership lasted for one year when Ford moved to Downieville, California, the county seat of Sierra County, where he practiced law under the firm name of Smith & Ford. He specialized in mining law.

In 1888, Ford was elected as District Attorney of Sierra County on the Republican ticket. He re-elected in 1890 to the office without opposition, the Democrats making no nomination against him.

Ford became Republican California State Senator in 1892 and 1895 for California's 3rd State Senate district, Plumas, Sierra, and Nevada Counties. On March 23, 1893, Senator Ford introduced two bills known as the Ford's Mining Bills, Senate Bill No. 50, which would allow hydraulic mining where it can be done without material injury to the navigable rivers, and Senate Bill No. 389, which would appropriate $250,000 for building restraining dams, provided by the United States Government.

He was appointed attorney to the State Board of Harbor Commissioners in 1894, which office he held until elected Attorney General for the state of California in 1898. Ford solved a difficult legal dispute over ownership of an area known as Channel Street located in the San Francisco's harbor leading to the bay. A judgment gave this land for public use to the city of San Francisco.

He served as the 18th California Attorney General 1899–1902. One of his noteworthy acts was the reversal of a decision regarding the inheritance tax on the Leland Stanford estate that converted $250,000 to public schools of San Francisco. He resigned as Attorney General in order to become General Counsel for the United Railroads (URR) of San Francisco.

In 1905, Governor George Pardee selected Ford to be the State Prison Director. Ford wrote a book called California State Prisons: their history, development and management, published in 1910. As director, he created a special bureau for paroled prisoners.

In August 1902, Ford was appointed general counsel for the United Railroads of San Francisco. His knowledge of railroad law as of other departments of jurisprudence was comprehensive and accurate, and he stands today as one of the foremost representatives of the legal interests of California. As attorney for URR, he was involved in a bribery scandal in 1906, but was later found to be innocent. The bribery scandal was one of the many San Francisco graft trials, which included Mayor Eugene Schmitz and attorney Abe Ruef, who were receiving bribes.

In his retirement, Ford took up historical studies and literary pursuits. In 1926 he published a novel, Dawn and the Dons: The Romance of Monterey, with vignettes and sketches by artist Jo Mora.

On June 26, 1928, Ford died in his bed due to a sudden heart attack. He was 70 years old. A funeral service was held at Gary's Chapel on Divisadero Street at Post in San Francisco. He was interred at the family mausoleum, at the Holy Cross Cemetery in Colma, California.

[[Woke]]

CATEGORIES: Black Lives Matter

Woke (' WOHK) is a word which originally referred to awareness about racism and discrimination. It later came to include an awareness of other issues of social inequality, for example regarding gender and sexual orientation. Since the late 2010s it has also been used as a general word for left-wing political movements and viewpoints which emphasise the identity politics of people of color (those who are not white), LGBT people, and women.

The phrase "stay woke" began within the everyday language of some African Americans in the 1930s, because in African-American Vernacular English (AAVE) woke is instead of woken, the usual past participle form of wake.

After the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri in 2014, the word was used by Black Lives Matter (BLM) activists who wanted to raise awareness about police shootings of African Americans in the US. It became an Internet meme and was increasingly utilised by individuals who were not African American to show that they supported BLM. Popular among millennials, the word spread worldwide and was added to the Oxford English Dictionary in 2017.

The word ended up being used as a catch-all term to describe left-wing ideologies, often centred on the identity politics of minority groups and informed by academic movements like critical race theory, which identified themselves as being devoted to social justice. This included BLM, anti-racism, and campaigns on women's and LGBT issues. By 2020, parts of the political right in some Western countries were ironically using the word "woke" to describe left-wing movements and ideologies they disagreed with. In turn, some left-wing activists came to consider it an offensive term used to belittle those campaigning against discrimination.

[[Person of color]]

CATEGORIES: Race, Social groups

A person of color (plural: people of color, sometimes persons of color) is an American term referring to someone who is not white. Since the 2010s, it has been used in other parts of the English-speaking world (sometimes using the British English spelling "person of colour").

In the United States, people of color include African Americans, Asian Americans, Native Americans, Pacific Islanders, mixed-race Americans, and some Latinos. It can also refer to people of non-white ancestry outside of the US.

The term "colored" was the older word for people of color in American English, but later came to be only used for "Negroes" (an outdated and offensive word for black people). It is now considered racist. In South Africa, "Coloureds" refers to multiple mixed-race ethnic groups, and is sometimes applied to other groups in Southern Africa, such as the Basters of Namibia.

[[Dehumanization]]

CATEGORIES: Hatred, Social issues

Dehumanization is the act of denying that a person is fully human, or treating a person like they are not fully human. Dehumanization makes it easier for people to be cruel to others, and inflict suffering.

Dehumanization can be used against a racial group or ethnicity, by comparing them to animals or monsters. In this way it is easier to abuse people of another group. For example, black people have been dehumanized by racist images comparing them to apes. Researchers say that this dehumanization continues to exist today: it can affect the punishment for a crime. Some people, such as Ota Benga, an African Mbuti man, were held in human zoos. They were shown for visitors' amusement, just like zoo animals.

Native Americans, Africans, and Aboriginal Australians were often pictured as unintelligent and savages. When Ireland became a colony of England, English newspapers showed the Irish as less cultured, less reasonable, and violent. 

In Nazi Germany, Nazis called Jews Untermensch, meaning less than human. Nazis also described Jews as rats. These words were used to allow the Nazis to kill millions of Jews in the Holocaust. The Nazis also dehumanized other groups, such as Romani people (Gypsies). In the Rwandan Genocide, Tutsis were described as cockroaches.

Women actors in pornography can be subject to objectification, which means they are seen as an object. The pornography is made for the pleasure of men, who may only see the actors for their body, not as a person. Some say that women are victims of objectification in their daily life. They say that society (especially men) sees women as sexual objects, and that the woman herself is seen as less important.

In the early nineties of the last century, the public of Ajmer collected a sum of Rs 44,000/- and handed it over to the Government as their contribution for the college.

[[COVID-19 pandemic in New York City]]

CATEGORIES: COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, 21st century in New York City

The COVID-19 pandemic first started affecting New York City and its nearby areas in mid-February 2020. It wasn't until March, however, that the COVID-19 virus was confirmed in and around New York City. 

On March 3, 2020, the New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that the first recorded case of person-to-person spread in New York State was confirmed from a New Rochelle man. That man was working with a law firm in One Grand Central Place in Midtown Manhattan. Six days following that announcement, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced there were sixteen cases of the COVID-19 in New York City.

The virus later grew extremely rapidly. By Wednesday, March 25, 2020, over 17,000 cases were confirmed in and near New York City. By that time, there were almost 200 COVID-19 related deaths. At the time, the city was infected with a rate just under five times higher than the rest of the United States. Its cases were one-third of the total U.S. cases. Two days later on Friday, March, 27, in that same area, the infection rate went over 23,000. By that day, there were 365 deaths from the COVID-19 in New York City. Queens was the worst-affected Borough in the number of deaths. It had well over a third of total deaths. Most of the deaths from COVID-19 involved those who had underlying health problems, including although not limited to diabetes (either type), being overweight/obese, having heart disease, HIV/AIDS, dementia, Down syndrome and certain cancers. During a twenty-four hour period on March 28 and 29, 2020, the number of deaths due to COVID-19 tripled in New York City. About 222 more death from the virus took place during that period. The overall deaths from the virus in that city was at 672. The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the same city was at or near 30,765. On Tuesday, March 31, the first death of a child due to COVID-19 in New York City was recorded. At the exact same time, CNN news anchor Chris Cuomo, the brother of Andrew Coumo, tested positive for the virus.

New York City also saw its first case of animals testing positive for COVID-19. Just after the Bronx Zoo in that city closed in mid-March 2020, two Malayan tigers were showing signs of the virus near the very end of the month. The cats, Nadia and her sister Azul, had a dry cough and wheezing. Nadia and Azul both tested positive for the virus. Seven other large cats at the Bronx Zoo also showed signs of the COVID-19 virus. The areas around that zoo were hit with the virus in high and large numbers. 

On Saturday, April 4, Governor Andrew Cuomo stated that the Chinese government arranged for the donation of just under 1,000 venilators being sent to the state of New York under foundations that were run by Joseph Tsai and Jack Ma. Another 140 ventilators were reported being sent by the state of Oregon.

On April 6, 2020, there were about 72,181 confirmed cases and at least 2,475 deaths. New York City accounted for just under 25% of the COVID-19 deaths in the United States. The following day, Gothamist reported the actual New York City death count as having been counted less than the actual numbers. Bodies of people who had died at home, around 280 every day, were being picked up by United States Army, the United States National Guard and the Air National Guard.

On May 10, Mayor de Blasio stated 38 children were found as having been affected by an inflammatory syndrome that might have been linked with an immune response from COVID-19. This condition was called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C); it was life-threatening. This condition was strongly similar to Kawasaki disease and toxic shock syndrome (two other conditions known to affect children and teenagers. One child had died in New York City. Another two child deaths were reported in New York State. An association with COVID-19 was not yet proven as of May 2020.

On Saturday, July 11, 2020, a seven-year-old German Shepherd named buddy died of COVID-19. The dog tested positive three months earlier when his guardians noticed he was having breathing problems. Buddy was the first dog in the United States to test positive for COVID-19.

[[The Pale of Settlement]]

CATEGORIES: Jewish history, History of Russia, Genetic disorders, Settlements in Russia

The Pale of Settlement was a term used by the Russian Empire. It meant the borders in which permanent residency by Jews was allowed (from 1791 to 1917). Beyond these places, Jewish residency, permanent or temporary, was mostly forbidden.

The old English term pale is got from the Latin word palus, a stake, and so extended to mean the area enclosed by a fence or boundary. 

The Pale of Settlement included all of modern Belarus, Lithuania and Moldova, much of Ukraine and Poland, and small parts of Latvia and the western Russian Federation. 

It extended from the eastern pale, or demarcation line inside the country, westwards to the Imperial Russian border with the Kingdom of Prussia (later the German Empire) and Austria-Hungary. It was about 20% of European Russia.

Historians argue that the motivations for its creation and maintenance were primarily economic and nationalist in nature.

The end of the enforcement and formal demarcation of the Pale coincided with the beginning of World War I in 1914 and then ultimately, the fall of the Russian Empire in the February and October Revolutions of 1917.

The religious nature of the edicts creating the Pale is clear: conversion to Russian Orthodoxy, the state religion, released people from the restrictions. Historians argue that the motivations for its creation were mainly economic and nationalist in nature.

Terrible anti-Jewish pogroms occurred from 1881–83 and from 1903–1906. The Jewish community responded by organising a welfare system.

One consequence of the Pale was a tendency to restrict marriage by Jews, not just to other Jews, but often in practice to those who attended  the same synagogue. The effects are similar to those of the Royal Families of Europe, who eventually showed the genetic effects of inbreeding even though the marriages were legal and in other ways quite appropriate. Just as in European royalty, the communities behind the Pale, and now in normal life, show a higher percentage of deleterious genetic defects than the wider population. This is because the parents were, unknowingly, to some extent consanguineous (related).

People who worked for the newspaper were accused of hacking phones, police bribery, and other crimes in order to get stories. Even though investigations that took place from 2005 to 2007 suggested that the newspaper only hacked the phones of celebrities, politicians, and people in the British royal family, in July 2011 it was found out that the phones of killed student Milly Dowler, family of dead British soldiers, and people killed in the 7 July 2005 London bombings had also been hacked. The anger of the public at News Corporation caused many well-known people to stop working there, including Rupert Murdoch and his son. The commissioner of London's Metropolitan Police Service (MPS), Sir Paul Stephenson, also left their jobs. Many companies stopped advertising work with the newspaper, leading to the end of the News of the World on 10 July 2011, after 168 years of making newspapers. Anger from the public meant News Corporation decided to cancel its suggested takeover of the British television broadcaster BSkyB.

The prime minister David Cameron said on 6 July 2011 that a public investigation, known as the Leveson Inquiry, would look into phone hacking and police bribery by the News of the World, if what some British newspapers did to get stories was okay and that the Press Complaints Commission would be changed and replaced fully. A few arrests and prison sentenced followed, most well-known being the arrest of the former News of the World top editor Andy Coulson.

[[Movie adaptation]]

CATEGORIES: Movie industry

Adapting a movie is the transfer of a certain work or story, either in part or in whole, to a motion picture. 

Common forms of movie adaptation are using a novel as the basis of a motion picture. Other works that are adapted to motion pictures are comic books, plays, historical sources and other movies.

Several plays from William Shakespeare have been adapted into movies. Those include Hamlet, Othello and Romeo and Juliet. Examples of Hamlet on screen are the 1969, 1990 and 1996 movies. Examples for Romeo and Juliet being adapted under film include the 1936, 1968  and Romeo + Juliet (1996) movies.

Across Britain, where stage plays tend being more popular for entertainment than in the United States, many movies start off as stage productions. Examples of British and British-American motion pictures based on successful British plays include Gaslight (1940), Shirley Valentine (1989) and The Madness of King George (1994).

In similar, hit Broadway plays are often adapted under movies. Examples of Broadway plays adapted under movies are A Streetcar Named Desire (1951), Children of a Lesser God (1986), Glengarry Glen Ross (1992) and Real Women Have Curves (2002).

Movies are sometimes created from a television series. In some cases, the movie offers a longer storyline than the usual television program format. In the adaptation of The X-Files to the movie format, greater effects and a longer plotline were involved. Adaptations of television shows will give the viewers an opportunity of seeing that show's characters without broadcast restrictions. Such additions–explicit sexual content, profanity, nudity, drug use, adult themes or graphic violence–are only the shown adaptive addition. Movie versions of Miami Vice and South Park are examples of such motion pictures adapted off the related television programs.

The main economical structure of Haiti's dependence from a foundational perspective on the stand of monetary needs is agriculture as stated before.  With any country whether home or abroad agriculture is what keeps a nation going.  Almost every " developed" countries  hides this simple truth because they have stolen from many of what is term uncolonized countries in order to fuel their countries.

Jovenel Moise, the president of Haiti represents a nation moving forward however little the progress is; as many of us know that its people is waking up from a system of souse peze for hundreds of years.  Indeed, the entire  globe has been rob by these "developed" countries and sadly Haiti was no exception. what set Haiti apart from other nations that has been robed by these" developed" nations is it is Luinion Fait La Force and that is the basis for  Jovenel Moise place in the Party of Tet Kale.  often we see and note that Haiti is one of the poorest country in the western Hemisphere, how can that be when Haiti is Haiti.

[[Free Mason Hall]]

CATEGORIES: Pakistan

Free Mason Hall Karachi before the partition, also known as Hope Lodge.  All the programs of the society were held in it.  Where there was a lot of hustle and bustle in the evening, there were rows of white Victorian cars in front of the building.  At that time they had 500 members.  Some of these notable names were Jam Mir Ayub Alamani, a big name in Karachi politically, socially, literary and culturally.

The building is viewed with suspicion after the partition.  Freemasonry is a well-thought-out Jewish organization.  Which is financially supported by the Jews.  And the symbol of the Jews is the Star of David, the eight-pointed star.

Well-known researcher Akhtar Baloch says that the reality before partition was somewhat different and it is also a fact that Muslims were included in these organizations before and after the formation of Pakistan.  The fact that Jews now have the Star of David and the Freemason's logo is part of the same propaganda.  There is a difference between the two signs.  The Freemason Hall logo and the Star of David are separate symbols.

How many buildings and graves of Jews can be seen in Star of David Karachi.

The first such thing came to light in 1972

Freemasonry activities were restricted under Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto.  Later, on July 18, 1973, the Bhutto government took control of the "Free Mason Hall"

He took possession of the entire record.  On July 19, Dawn reported that the Sindh government, led by the area magistrate, had sealed off the local hall near the YMC and seized the record.  Hall took over at the behest of a rebel group.  The general impression is that Freemasonry is a Jewish organization.  And that is against Islamic ideology.

They have 1750 members all over Pakistan.  Of these, 700 are members of the Karachi headquarters.  According to reports, there are Free Mason Lodge Halls in Karachi, Hyderabad, Sukkur, Lahore, Multan, Rawalpindi, Tarbela, Quetta and Peshawar.

After capturing the Freemason Hall record, no one knows where it is now

The Free Mason Hall in Lahore was founded in 1860.  This hall is known as "Lahore Temple".  The building is now in the hands of the Punjab government.  Where offices of various government departments have been set up.  Dr. Muhammad Ibrahim Sheikh was the last Past Master of Freemason Lodge Hall Karachi.  He was taken over by Dr. RB Kabhata in May 1973.

It may be recalled that when Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto restricted the activities of Free Mason Hall in 1972, his activities continued in spite of him.  Earlier, in 1961, the Pakistani government and members of the Pakistani forces banned him from being a member of the Free Mason Rotary Club and the Lions Club.  The same ban was imposed on other government employees in 1969.

When Zia-ul-Haq banned the activities of the Freemasons on June 17, 1983, under the Marshall Law, Regulation 56, his activities continued.  Because the order did not specify legal or illegal activities.  Therefore, according to the members, they were carrying out legal activities.  With this in mind, the Government declared the Martial Law Regulation of 17 June 1983 by the Martial Law Administrator on 29 December 1985.  Under the order, the Freemasons were banned.  Under section (5), this decision cannot be challenged in any court.  And the person who obstructs the order under section (7) shall be punished severely with imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years and with fine.

The Freemasons were banned in Iran after the 1979 revolution.  Thus, in only two countries in the world, Pakistan and Iran, the Free Mason organization has the Hope Lodge in the early 1990s and the Wildlife Accounts and Head Office at the Sindh Wildlife Time Freemason Lodge Hall.  Where the Sindh government building was made a national heritage, renovation and decoration under the 1994 Act.

The building and hall are still in good condition.  Where there are commemorative plaques.  A plaque commemorates the Freemason Roberts Shepherd of Karachi.  Apart from these ten boards, only these boards are left for the students of Free Mason Hall.

[[Texas Two-Step]]

CATEGORIES: Dance

The Texas Two-Step is a dance that originated in 1845 when Texas was first founded. Within 2 months, the founders of Texas (Davie Rocket, John Menger III, Chris Alamo, and Antonio Sanders) adopted the dance as a staple of Texas heritage. Historians still argue about if the dance originated after the successful Battle of the Bulge or the war of 1899 with Houston.

The dance is performed by putting your lead foot behind your support foot while simultaneously twisting your pelvis in a counter-clockwise motion, being sure to point your toes toward your partner. Keep in mind, the entirety of the dance is completed by two Texas sized steps (around 4.2x as large as a standard U.S. step). What follows these two steps is a series of freestyle movements that vary between performers. For example, Davie Rocket adopted the "Hemisfair" movement, where you proceed to grab your partner by the pinky and swing her around your head similar to the motion of a lasso.

Importance

The Texas Two-Step and other forms of step related lone star dances have become a cultural staple of the state down under. Bordering states have attempted to plagiarize this dance in ways of their own, but to no avail. For example, Louisiana created the Boot Stompin' Bop, until it faded into obscurity in 1923 after the housing market crash. Arkansas native Dick Rutherford created the Whiskey Slammer Toe Spinner, but 2 minutes into the debut of the dance, Dick was shot in the Golden Monkey Saloon. The only dance to remain a southern tradition as much as the Texas Two-Step, is the Texas Two-Step.

Notable Sightings

Many notable individuals have been seen in public performing the famous dance. Tom Alamodome, John "Hand-Standin'" Johnson, and Brett were all sighted at Shiner Park performing the moves of the golden days. They were all sighted by Eva Longoria, former Spurs trophy wife.
