Incidents have taken place near the Pangong Lake in Ladakh and the Nathu La pass in Sikkim. In addition, face-offs are ongoing at locations in eastern Ladakh, along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) which was the result of the 1962 Sino-Indian War.

[["Litoria" castanea]]

CATEGORIES: Animals of Australia, Frogs

"''Litoria''" ''castanea, also known as the 'yellow-spotted tree frog, New England swamp frog, tablelands bell frog or yellow-spotted bell frog''' is a frog from eastern Australia. People thought these frogs were extinct, but then scientists found some in 2009.

There used to be two groups of yellow-spotted bell frogs, one in the north on the New England Tableland and one in the south near Canberra.  Some scientists said these should count as two different species of frogs.  The northern frogs lived between 1000 and 1500 meters above sea level and the southern frogs lived between 700 and 800 meters above sea level.  Both groups of frogs lived in permanent bodies of water, like swamps, lagoons, and the parts of rivers where the water flows slowly.

People thought these frogs all died from a fungus disease in the 1970s, but in 2009 some were found alive in the Southern Tablelands.  At first, the scientists did not tell anyone where they found the frog. They were worried that frog fans would come to take photographs of them, try to catch them, or scare them away.  The scientists took some of the frogs and tadpoles to the Taronga Zoo. The scientists left the other yellow-spotted tree frogs where they were. The person who owned the land where the frogs were living agreed to help protect them.

Sometime after that, the wild frogs all died. In 2018, scientists took some of the frogs they had raised at the Taronga Zoo and set them free in another part of the Southern Tablelands.  The scientists asked any person who thought they'd heard the frogs to make a recording of their calls with their phones.

The largest yellow-spotted tree frogs are 8 cm long.  They have yellow or white spots on their legs and bellies.  Their feet are completely webbed. Their backs are green with bronze and black spots. Their voices sound like a car engine failing to start.

These frogs look for food at night and like to sit in the sun during the day.  They lay their eggs on underwater plants.  During the winter, these frogs hide under stones, logs, or plants.

The government of Australia has made programs to protect these frogs.  They are in danger from feral cats that like to eat them and from a fungus that causes a disease called chytridiomycosis.  Scientists think that invasive species of fish and more ultraviolet radiation may also be killing these frogs.  Too much ultraviolet light can stop their eggs from hatching.

[[Genetic fallacy]]

CATEGORIES: Logical fallacies

A genetic fallacy is a kind of fallacy where something or someone is judged by its past or its origin rather than what it is in the present. An example of genetic fallacy is the argument, "people who own Volkswagens are evil because Volkswagen is a car company that was created by the Nazi Party." Just because the Nazi Party did create Volkswagen does not mean the Volkswagen Group today (or even people that buy Volkswagen cars) support or promote the ideas or values of Nazism.

[[Slippery slope]]

CATEGORIES: Logical fallacies

The slippery slope argument is an argument that a small step will or must lead to a certain chain of events. The hypothetical chain of events leads to a significant (usually negative) result. So unintended consequences follow the first step in the chain of events. 

An example of this is the domino effect theory. During the Vietnam War, many people in the United States believed that if Vietnam were to unite and become communist, then the rest of Southeast Asia would eventually become communist too, unless the United States got involved in actively stopping communism.

A slippery slope argument can also be a slippery slope fallacy. Fallacies are statements that sound reasonable but are actually logically flawed or sometimes even dishonest. Whether or not a slippery slope argument is a fallacy depends on whether it becomes true necessarily or just in practice. In many cases it just acts as a warning, and readers have to use common sense as to its truth value. So, strictly speaking, these are fallacies only in the sense that they pretend certain consequences will follow, when in reality the consequences merely may follow.

A more specific example is the argument that:

If any of the steps is unsound, then the whole argument is unsound. Step number 3 may or may not be true, but since the argument says step number 3 will happen, the whole argument is not sound.

[[Fallacy of composition]]

CATEGORIES: Logical fallacies

A fallacy of composition is a fallacy where on believes that if something is true for part of something else, then it must be true for the whole. For example, if sodium (Na) and chlorine (Cl) are dangerous for humans, then table salt (NaCl) must also be dangerous for humans.

[[Fallacy of division]]

CATEGORIES: Logical fallacies

The fallacy of division is a fallacy where someone believes that is something is true for the whole, then it must be true for the parts of the whole as well. For example, if a basketball team is very good, then all the players on the team must be good. The opposite of this is the fallacy of composition.

[[No true Scotsman]]

CATEGORIES: Logical fallacies

A no true Scotsman fallacy, or appeal to purity, is a fallacy where the one arguing says or writes that all people belonging to a certain group have the same trait, and those in that group who do not share that trait are not really part of that group. The name comes from an example made up by Anthony Flew.

"No true Scotsman puts brown sugar on his porridge. The fact that Angus MacGregor puts brown sugar on his porridge just proves that he's no true Scotsman!"

The word "Scotsman" can really be replaced with any group a person is talking about.

Another example is, "Any Chinese who cannot make dumplings is not really Chinese," or "You could not be from the South. No Southernern I know would ever turn down a glass of sweet tea."

For the argument to not be a fallacy, the thing being talked about must have a trait that excludes themselves from the category.

One argument that is not a no true Scotsman fallacy is "Janice is not really a vegetarian because I saw her eat a chicken sandwich yesterday." Vegetarians, by definition, are people who do not eat meat. Since Janice ate a chicken sandwich, a meal that has meat in it, Janice is therefore not a vegetarian.

Another argument that is not a fallacy is "Jim is not an atheist because he believes that there could be a god or gods". Since the definition of an atheist is someone who full believes that there is no god or gods, Jim therefore cannot be an atheist because he does not fully believe that god or gods do not exist. However, Jim could be an agnostic, someone who is does not know for sure whether or not god or gods exist.

Another argument that is a fallacy is "Darcy is not really a Democrat because she is against abortion." Even though most Democrats are for some levels of abortion, not all people who vote for Democrats are for abortion. Darcy might agree with the Democratic Party on other issues, like having a higher minimum wage or spending less money on the military, but disagreeing on one issue does not automatically make her not a Democrat. In fact, most people who vote for certain political parties will not agree with their party on every issue, but they will agree on the issues that are most important to themselves. 

On the other side, saying "to be Christian is to be Republican" is also a fallacy. Although in America, a higher number of Christians vote for Republicans, there are also many Christians who vote for Democrats. There are also many non-Christians such as atheists, Muslims, Hindus, Jews, etc., who vote for Republicans.

Ely Culbertson (July 22, 1891 – December 27, 1955) was an American contract bridge player, entrepreneur and personality. He was the dominant figure in the game in the 1930s. He played and publicized the new game. He was a great showman, and was widely regarded as "the man who made contract bridge". He became rich, was highly extravagant, and lost and gained fortunes several times over.

Culbertson was a brilliant publicist; he played several famous challenge matches and won them all. Two were played in the U.S., against teams led by Sidney Lenz in 1931–32 (the so-called "Bridge Battle of the Century") and by P. Hal Sims in 1935, the latter between the married couples Culbertson and Sims. 

Four team matches were played in London. These matches had  big publicity in newspapers, on radio and on cinema newsreels. The hands became the subject of intense discussion on bidding methods.

Culbertson was finally beaten in Budapest, June 1937, in the final match of the first world championship teams tournament, by the 6-man Austria team led by Dr. Paul Stern. It was his last appearance in a tournament or match.

Culbertson founded and edited The Bridge World magazine, which is still published today, and wrote many newspaper articles and books on bridge. He owned the first firm of playing card manufacturers to develop plastic cards, Kem Cards, and developed and owned a chain of bridge schools with teachers qualified in the Culbertson bidding system. He continued to play high-stakes rubber bridge for many years, but gave up tournament and match competition in 1938 to write and work for world peace.

Anglo-American matches after World War II, of which there were a number, did not involve Culbertson.

[[Externality]]

CATEGORIES: Economics

In economics, some decisions affect third parties. These parties can be affected by the decision positively or negatively, but this influence is involuntary. This is known as an externality, or an external effect. The problem with externalities is that no one pays for the cost of these effects. Usually, they are not part of the decision process. Externalities are often a form of market failure. In many cases, actors like states need to become active. 

An example of an externality is pollution. One way to solve this is to introduce taxes on the goods that cause the pollution, for example carbon dioxide, which is the one of the causes of global warming. With concepts such as emissions trading, these externalities can again become part of the market system (and are no longer external).

[[Brown tree frog]]

CATEGORIES: Animals of Australia, Frogs

The brown tree frog, whistling tree frog, Ewing's tree frog, or southern brown tree frog (Litoria ewingii) is a frog from Australia.  It lives in southeastern Australia and Tasmania, but it also lives in New Zealand. 

Adults are about 3.0 to 5.0 cm long.  Females are larger than males.  It is light brown in colour with a lighter belly and some patterns.  Its feet are usually not webbed.  The ends of their toes have suckers for climbing.

This frog can live in marshes, grasslands or on mountains.  It lays eggs 500-600 at a time on underwater plants in ponds, streams, dams, and ditches.  It takes months for them to grow into frogs.  Unlike most frogs, the brown tree frog can lay eggs at any time during the year. 

In New Zealand, brown frog tadpoles often given to schoolchildren so they can watch the tadpoles become frogs.  This frog is now an invasive specie in New Zealand because people set the young frogs free outside after the project is done. Once they are released, brown tree frogs can kill New Zealand frogs by eating all their food or by giving them diseases from other places.

[[Divergent series]]

CATEGORIES: Mathematical analysis

In mathematics, a divergent series is an infinite series that is not convergent, meaning that the infinite sequence of the partial sums of the series does not have a finite limit.

If a series converges, the individual terms of the series must approach zero. Thus any series in which the individual terms do not approach zero diverges. However, convergence is a stronger condition: not all series whose terms approach zero converge. A counterexample is the harmonic series

The divergence of the harmonic series was proven by the medieval mathematician Nicole Oresme.

Benfica Juniors and remained there for 2 seasons. He eventually moved on to the Portuguese team Ribeirão in 2011 and Rio Ave in 2012.

[[Byers island]]

CATEGORIES: Phantom islands

Benjamin Morrell  writes that he landed on an island he called Byers Island, on 12th July 1825.  According to Morrell, this island was at a position of 28 degrees 32 minutes North, and 177 degrees 4 seconds East.  He writes about this, in his book A narrative of four voyages. 

This island is a phantom island, and does not exist. Just before, he visited Pearl and Hermes Reef, and gives exact positions for the the reef. It can therefore be excluded, that he landed on Kure, and gave a wrong position for it.  

Byers is the name of the owner of the ship, and one of Morrell's employers.This  is another hint that Morrell may be the source of the hoax.  According to Burton R. Pollin, Morrells ghostwriter was the magazine editor and playwright Samuel Woodworth.   

So even though Morrell may not be the source of this and other false items in his work, he certainly knew about them. He knew about the "rectified" content of his book.  

Morrell sacrificed his scientific reputation in order to be able to increase the sales of his book.  

The official maritime manual of 1899 already lists Byer island and Morrell Island as doubtful. 

Despite this, globes of 1960s still show the islands, along four other phantom islands, northwest of Kure.

[[Galois theory]]

Galois theory (pronounced gal-wah) is a subject in mathematics that is centered around the connection between two mathematical structures, fields and groups. Fields are sets of numbers (sometimes abstractly called elements) that have a way of adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing. Groups are like fields, but with only one operation often called addition (subtraction is considered addition with negative numbers). Fields are often hard to study because there are so many possible combinations of numbers, that the internal structure is hard to decipher. Groups are usually much less complex and easier to understand. Galois theory gives a concrete connection between hard to study fields and easy to study groups.

The bumpy rocket frog or Peter's frog (Litoria inermis) is a frog from Australia. It lives all across the northern and eastern parts of Australia, in Queensland, the Northern Territory, and Western Australia.

An adult frog is 3.5 cm in length.  It is light and dark brown with some yellow marks on its legs and a white spot near its jaws. Its front feet have no webbing and its back feet have some webbing.  Its skin is bumpy.

The scientists who first wrote about this frog in the 1800s thought it was a burrowing frog, meaning a frog that likes to dig into the ground and spend time underground, but it is not.  Its scientific name, "inermis", means "does not have a weapon". Most burrowing frogs have sharp bones in their feet, but the bumpy rocket frog does not.  Burrowing frogs use these bones to dig.

This frog lives in flood plains, forests, grasslands, swamps and streams, but it can live in rocky places if there are streams through them.

Females lay their eggs 100-300 at a time in temporary bodies of water with no plants in them.  The tadpoles can grow to 4 cm.

[[Appeal to novelty]]

CATEGORIES: Logical fallacies

Appeal to novelty is a fallacy where a person would claim that Subject B is better than Subject A because Subject B is newer, or that "newer is better". This fallacy is understandable because people find new discoveries everyday. Since new discoveries are made everyday, people are quick to think that the new thing will be better than the old thing because of the possibility that the new thing was made to fix the mistakes of the old thing.

An example of appeal to novelty is that "the newer versions of the iPhone will always be better then the older versions because smartphone technology becomes more advanced every year."

An example that people use to prove this argument wrong is New Coke, because even though it was made later than the older Coca-Cola, most people who have tasted New Coke say it tasted worse than Coca-Cola.

The opposite of appeal to novelty is appeal to tradition.

Since the methods of TCM are different from Western medicine, it is hard to find evidence that shows how safe or good TCM really is. 

Many of the most important ideas in TCM are based on the teachings of Daoism. Based on the teachings of TCM, it is important to balance the five elements in a person's body: wood, fire, earth, metal, and water. Each element also has something called yin and yang, or opposite values that must exist alongside each other rather than to overcome the other. The way to balance the yin and yang is to strengthen qi, or an invisible force that brings balance to the yin and yang. Knowing the five elements and the yin and yang is important because each organ of the body is related to one of the five elements. It is important to strengthen a person's qi because balancing the yin and yang of a person's organs is important for people to be healthy. The different treatments in TCM are made to bring balance to the elements in a person's body.

These ideas are similar to, but not the same as, the four temperaments, which was an widely-believed theory in European medicine before scientific medicine was created.

The James W. Dalton Highway, usually called the Dalton Highway and signed as the Alaska Route 11, is a road in Alaska. It used to be called North Slope Haul Road, and some people still call it this. The road is 414 long. It starts from the Elliott Highway just north of Fairbanks and travels north, ending near to the Arctic Ocean coast at Deadhorse. It follows the path next to the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System. Many people think the highway is one of the most dangerous in the world. It was on one of the episodes of the BBC's programe World's Most Dangerous Roads.

There are only three very small towns along the route: Coldfoot (population: 10), Wiseman (population: 22), and Deadhorse (population: 25). Prospect Creek and Galbraith Lake only have campers there, and nobody lives there. The road is made mostly of gravel. About 109 of the road is paved. People who travel on the road are told to bring first aid kits and other items for survival, in case they have an emergency.

[[Affinity chromatography]]

CATEGORIES: Biochemistry, Laboratory techniques

Affinity chromatography is one way scientists separate molecules from each other.  Using affinity chromatography, they can take just one kind of molecule out of a mixture of many molecules.  Affinity chromatography works on molecules that exist inside the bodies of living things and not on other molecules.  Affinity chromatography is one kind of liquid chromatography.

Affinity chromatography works because most molecules from inside living things stick to some molecules but not others, the way magnets stick to opposite magnets but not to wood or plastic.  An antibody will stick to its antigen but not to a different antibody's antigen.  A protein will stick to its own receptor or inhibitor but not to a different protein's receptor or inhibitor.  A DNA-splicing protein will stick to its own DNA sequence but not to a different DNA sequence.  In affinity chromatography, the thing that the target molecule sticks to is called the ligand.

To prepare for affinity chromatography, scientists decide which molecule they want and find its ligand.  The ligand could be an antibody if the target molecule has an antigen; DNA if the target molecule is a polymerase, DNA-binding protein, or DNA-binding enzyme; aromatic molecules if the target is a different kind of enzyme; or a peptide if the target is another biomolecule.  Then they prepare a stationary phase and treat it with the ligand.  The stationary phase can be membranes, special beads, or supports with different-sized pores in them.

Then the scientists pour the mixture, or mobile phase over the stationary phase.  Sometimes, the scientists add a binding buffer to help the target molecule stick to its ligand.  Then the scientists rinse away the rest of the mixture.  The target molecule is stuck to its ligand, which is stuck to the stationary phase, so it is not rinsed away.  Then the scientists add an elution buffer to make the ligand let go of the target molecule so they can collect it.  Scientists sometimes use machines or special tools to hold the stationary phase in exactly the right position and to pour the mixture, rinse, and other treatments in exactly the right way.

In some affinity chromatography, the binding buffer and elution buffer work by changing the pH of the solution.  That means they make it more acidic or less acidic.  Because most molecules from living things change shape depending on how much acid is nearby, the binding buffer and elution buffer can make the ligand and target molecule change shape to hold on tighter or let go of each other.

Affinity chromatography does not always work perfectly.  Sometimes the scientists must purify the target molecule to make sure they did not accidentally collect other molecules too.

Because scientists need to prepare a stationary phase with exactly the right ligand, they can only use affinity chromatography to collect molecules that they already understand well.  Usually, they cannot use affinity chromatography to collect new or strange molecules.

[[Sunk cost fallacy]]

CATEGORIES: Logical fallacies

A sunk cost fallacy is a fallacy where someone convinces themselves that they should continue doing something because they put in a lot of time and/or effort into it, even if they actually get very little reward out of it. For example, a person might watch the first six episodes of Battlestar Galatica, but decides they do not like the show. However, because there was a sunk cost, six hours of time, that person tells themselves that because they already spent so much time on it, they might as well finish the show.

An example in the real-world would be pro-war Americans during the Vietnam War. Americans who supported United States' part in the Vietnam War believed that the US already spent so much money, so much time, and so many lives of veterans and civilians that if the United States were to let the communists win the war, then all the loss would have been for nothing.

[[Santos-Dumont 14-bis]]

CATEGORIES: Aircraft, Aviation

italictitlethumb|right|The Santos-Dumont 14-bis.

The Santos-Dumont 14-bis was a biplane invented in the early 1900s by Alberto Santos-Dumont.  In the fall of 1906, it became the first airplane to fly in Europe.

Santos-Dumont tried several times before he truly managed to fly in the 14-bis.  His first attempt in July 1906 did not work.  In September, he managed two short hops.  In October, the 14-bis flew for 50 meters.  That was the first flight that the Aero Club of France ever officially witnessed.  In November, he was able to keep the 14-bis in the air for 220 meters, 6 meters up in the air.

According to the Aero Club of France, the 14-bis was 40 feet wide from wingtip to wingtip, 33 feet wide, and weighed 352 pounds.  It used an Antoinette engine.  It was made out of pine and and bamboo with aluminum to keep it together.  Its wings were made out of silk cloth. 

The 14-bis had three different sets of controls so Alberto Santos-Dumont could steer.  Some were tied to his shoulders so that he looked like he was dancing or shaking while in the air.

No one knows where the original 14-bis from the fall of 1906 is now.  Experts think Santos-Dumont took it apart and used the pieces to build other airplanes.

Some people, especially in Brazil, believe the 14-bis was the first airplane to fly, before the Wright Brothers' Flyer.  The main reason for this is that although the Wright Brothers flew the Flyer at Kitty Hawk in 1903, they did not tell many people about it right away.  Europeans saw Alberto Santos-Dumont fly the 14-bis in 1906 before they heard about the Wrights flying the Flyer in 1903.  This was because the Wright Brothers hoped to patent their work and make money, so they kept most of their experiments a secret.  Alberto Santos Dumont was not trying to make money, so he invited almost anyone who wanted to come watch him work.  However, the Wright Brothers did invite witnesses to their first flight at Kitty Hawk in 1903 to watch and take a photograph.  By 1906, the Wright Brothers had flown many of their planes many times, for as far as 39 kilometers. Today, most aviation historians believe that the 14-bis was not the first plane to fly.

Litoria megalops is a frog from Indonesia. Scientists saw it on the western half of the island of New Guinea, in Indonesia's Papua Province.  It is related to L. becki, L. micromembrana and L. modica.

Male adult frogs are about 2.7 to 2.8 cm long and females are 3.2 to 3.6 cm long.  This frog has very large eyes for its size, which is why scientists named it megalops, which means large eyes.  Its front feet are not webbed, but its hind feet are.  It has teeth on its upper jaw.  Some of the frogs are the yellow-brown color of amber with a green mark over each eye and a green stripe on the body, and some are bright orange in color.  

Scientists found this frog living 1070 meters above sea level.  It was found only in the fast-flowing parts of the Wapona River, so they call it a torrent-dwlling frog.  The scientists checked slow-flowing streams nearby and saw that this frog did not live in them. 

This frog has clear eggs.  It lays its eggs underneath rocks at the bottoms of streams.  The tadpoles have flattened bodies and suckers on their mouths.

[[Battle of Kaiapit]]

CATEGORIES: 1940s in Oceania, 1943, Pacific battles of World War II, History of Papua New Guinea, Battles involving Australia, Battles involving Japan, Battles involving the United States, September events

The Battle of Kaiapit was fought in 1943 between Australian and Japanese forces in New Guinea during the Finisterre Range campaign of World War II. Following landings at Nadzab and at Lae, the Allies attempted to exploit their success with an advance into the upper Markham Valley, starting with Kaiapit. The Australian 2/6th Independent Company flew into the valley from Port Moresby in 13 USAAF C-47 Dakotas, making a difficult landing on a rough airstrip. Unaware that a much larger Japanese force was also headed for Kaiapit and Nadzab, the company attacked the village on 19 September to secure the area so that it could be developed into an airfield. They then held it against a strong counterattack. During two days of fighting the larger force, the Australians suffered relatively few losses. Their victory at Kaiapit enabled the Australian 7th Division to be flown into the upper Markham Valley, stopping the Japanese from threatening Lae or Nadzab, where a major airbase was being developed. The victory also led to the capture of the Ramu Valley, which provided new forward fighter airstrips for the air war.

[[Wallum sedge frog]]

CATEGORIES: Animals of Australia, Frogs

The wallum sedge frog or olongburra frog (Litoria olongburensis) is a frog from eastern Australia.  It lives in Queensland and New South Wales.

The adult male frogs is 2.5 cm long and the female is 2.7 to 3.1 cm long.  It is gray, brown or bright green, with blue or orange colour on its legs.  It has brown and white stripes and a white belly.  It has only a little webbing on the front feet and more on the hind feet.  It has large discs on its toes for climbing.  It has vomerine teeth in its upper jaw.

This frog lives near the ocean and on islands with sandy soil.  It lives in creeks and marshes that have acidic water (pH 2.8-5.5), such as wallums.  If the water becomes less acidic, then other frogs move in and eat all the food. Adult frogs climb on sedge plants during the day.

This frog lays eggs in acidic water (pH < 6) in temporary or semi-permanent swamps.  They lay eggs 200-1000 at a time near sedge plants.

This frog is also in danger because humans like to build things in the places where they live.  Humans like beaches and seashores, so they sometimes walk over the grasses and shore plants where the frog likes to hide during the day.  Scientists also think the fungal disease chytridiomycosis might be killing these frogs.

Scientists think this frog is also in danger because of invasive species.  Plants from other places might change the places where these frogs like to live.  Frogs from other places eat all their food.  Fish from other places, such as mosquito fish, eat the tadpoles and eggs.  Feral pigs can also run through the wallums and damage them. 

[[Naive set theory]]

CATEGORIES: Set theory

When people started to talk about sets, mostly in the 19th century, they did this using natural language. It uses many of the concepts already known from discrete mathematics; for example Venn diagrams to show which elements are contained in a set, or Boolean algebra. It is powerful enough for many areas of contemporary mathematics and engineering. The term naive set theory is used for this kinds of set theory. It is usually contrasted with axiomatic set theory.

Naive set theory leads to a number of problems:

There is a problem though: All the problems above can only be shown to be problems when axioms can be used to describe sets and their properties. 

Richard Dedekind (1831-1916) discovered this and started a new set theory, in 1888. In his set theory, there are axioms about sets. His set theory is not good enough though:

Ernst Zermelo published a set theory in 1908. It uses axioms to define sets, and very much limits the ways in which sets can be made. Together with   Abraham Fraenkel he is one of the creators of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, the set theory that was used for the much of the 20th century. Because of Gödel's incompleteness theorems this can only be proved for finite sets, though.

When teaching about sets in schools, naive set theory and the definition of Georg Cantor are sometimes used.

[[Eastern mosquitofish]]

CATEGORIES: Fish

The eastern mosquitofish, eastern gambusia,  or mosquito fish (Gambusia holbrooki) is a fish that belongs to the Poeciliidae family.  It is from the eastern United States but human beings brought it to many other parts of the world, such as Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and Australia, where it has caused problems as an invasive specie.

The adult male eastern mosquitofish grows to 3.5 cm and the female to 6.0 cm.  It is green or brown on top and blue, white or silver on the bottom.  It has large eyes and one dorsal fin and a round tail fin.

This fish likes to live in fresh water but can live in water that has some salt.  It can survive cold and warm temperatures.  It eats insects and their larvae.

People brought the eastern mosquitofish to Hawaii in the 1910s and to Australia in the 1920s and set it free there.  They thought it would eat mosquito larvae so there would be fewer mosquitoes.  But the eastern mosquitofish did not eat more mosquitoes than the fish that were already in Australia did.  The eastern mosquitofish outcompetes other fish and bites their tails or even eats them.  It can kill larger fish by damaging their fins.  In the western United States, the eastern mosquitofish killed or outcompeted many other fish that were better at controlling mosquitoes than it is.  After people put eastern mosquitofish in a body of water, there may be an algal bloom because the eastern mosquitofish eats or kills all the fish that usually eat the algae.

This fish likes to eat frog eggs and tadpoles.  It is one reason why the green and golden bell frog is endangered in Australia and the Chiricahua leopard frog in Arizona. 

The fish has 50-300 eggs at a time.  The eggs stay inside the female's body until they hatch.  It takes the new fish two months to become adults.  Eastern mosquitofish can do this several times each year.

The western mosquitofish G. affinis and eastern mosquitofish G. holbrooki used to both be called G. affinis because people thought they were the same species.  They are not.  According to the IUCN Global Invasive Species Database, most records in Australia that say "G. affinis" really refer to G. holbrooki.

[[Medicaid]]

CATEGORIES: United States

Medicaid in the United States is a federal and state program that helps with medical costs for some people with limited income and resources. Medicaid also offers benefits not normally covered by Medicare, including nursing home care and personal care services. The program is jointly funded by the federal government and individual states. It is operated at the state level which means that coverage and administration vary greatly from state to state. It is available only to individuals and families who meet specific income-based criteria.

Medicaid is the largest source of funding for medical and health-related services for people with low income in the United States, providing free health insurance to 74 million low-income and disabled people (23% of Americans) as of 2017.

Under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010, states had the option to expand Medicaid coverage to nearly all low-income people under the age of 65. Eligibility for children was extended to at least 133% of the federal poverty level, and states now have the option to cover adults with income levels at or below 133% of the federal poverty level. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) expanded coverage so that more Americans have access to health insurance—which includes mental health treatment coverage. Under the ACA, both mental and behavioral health disorders are covered similarly to physical health disorders. This includes the treatment of substance use disorders.

[[Portuguese Ceylon]]

Portuguese Ceylon (Ceilão Português, Sinhala: පෘතුගීසි ලංකාව Puruthugisi Lankawa, Tamil: போர்த்துக்கேய இலங்கை Porthukeya Ilankai) is the name given to the territory on Ceylon, modern-day Sri-Lanka, controlled by the Portuguese Empire between 1597 and 1658.

Portuguese presence in the island lasted from 1505 to 1658. Their arrival was largely accidental, and the Portuguese sought control of commerce, rather than territory. The Portuguese were later drawn into the internal politics of the island with the political upheaval of the Wijayaba Kollaya, and used these internal divisions to their advantage during the Sinhalese–Portuguese War, first in an attempt to control the production of valuable cinnamon and later of the entire island. Direct Portuguese rule did not begin until after the death of Dharmapala of Kotte, who died without an heir, and had bequeathed the Kingdom of Kotte to the Portuguese monarch in 1580. That allowed the Portuguese sufficient claim to the Kingdom of Kotte upon Dharmapala's death in 1597. Portuguese rule began with much resistance by the local population.

Eventually, the Kingdom of Kandy sought help from the Dutch East India Company, with whom they initially entered into agreement. After the collapse of the Iberian economy in 1627, the Dutch–Portuguese War saw the Dutch conquest of most of Portugal's Asian colonies - Ceylon included, between 1638 and 1658. Nevertheless, elements of Portuguese culture from this colonial period remain in Sri Lanka.

[[Mosquitofish]]

CATEGORIES: Fish

The mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis), also known as the mosquito fish, western mosquitofish, western gambusia, or live-bearing tooth carp, is a fish that belongs to the Poeciliidae family.  It is from the southern and midwestern United States and east coast of Mexico. Human beings brought it to many other parts of the world, such as Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and Australia, where it has caused problems as an invasive specie.  Some scientists say that the western mosquitofish has had the largest effect on the environment of any fish in Poeciliidae.

The adult male western mosquitofish grows to 4 cm and the female to 7 cm. It has a round tail fin. It eats algae, insects, and other invertebrates.  It can eat more than its own body weight every day.  It can live in water that is twice as salty as seawater.  It can live in water as hot as 43°C.

In the early 20th century, people brought the western mosquitofish to other places because they thought it would eat mosquitoes and their larvae, but this did not work.  Sometimes there were more mosquitoes than before:  The western mosquitofish ate, outcompeted or killed other fish that were eating mosquitoes.  It sometimes killed fish that were better at controlling mosquitoes than it was.  It also ate some of the insects that had been eating the mosquitos and larvae.  It also ate zooplankton, which left more food for the mosquito larvae.

The western mosquitofish can kill larger fish by attacking their fins and eating their eggs and babies.  It eats smaller fish.  It likes to eat frog eggs and tadpoles. After people put western mosquitofish in a body of water, there may be an algal bloom because the western mosquitofish eats or kills all the fish that usually eat the algae. The western mosquitofish is one reason why many other species are endangered.  Some of the important ones are the Railroad Valley springfish (Crenichthys baileyi) in Nevada, the Sonoran topminnow (Poeciliopsis occidentalis) in Arizona, and the damselfly in Hawaii.

The western mosquitofish usually has 60 eggs at a time, but it can have as many as 300 at a time.  The eggs stay inside the female's body until they hatch.

The western mosquitofish G. affinis and eastern mosquitofish G. holbrooki used to both be called G. affinis because people thought they were the same species.  They are not.  According to the IUCN Global Invasive Species Database, most records in Australia that say "G. affinis" really refer to G. holbrooki.

Burmese amber, or Burmite or Kachin amber, is amber from the Hukawng Valley in northern Myanmar. It is important for its fossils from the earliest part of the Upper Cretaceous, in the Cenomanian age, 99 million years ago. The amber has been commercially exploited since the first century AD. Research on the deposit may fund internal conflict in Myanmar. 

The amber has flora and fauna especially arthropods such as  insects and arachnids. There are also also birds, lizards, snakes, frogs and fragments of dinosaur remains. 

The fossils arachnids in the amber include:

15 families of myriapods are in the amber

[[Peron's tree frog]]

CATEGORIES: Animals of Australia, Frogs

Peron's tree frog or emerald-spotted tree frog (Litoria peronii) is a frog from Australia.  It lives in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland, but people have also seen it in a few other places.

The adult frog is 6.0 cm long.  It lives in forests, grasslands and swamps.  It has sometimes been seen in northwestern Australia, far from its natural range.  Citizen scientists from Frogwatch SA think this is because people keep Peron's tree frogs as pets and then they either escape or are set free.  This frog is usually gray-green during the day.  It turns red-brown with green spots at night.  It has black and yellow colouring on its legs. It looks very similar to Tyler's tree frog.  Scientists tell them apart because their voices sound different.

This frog lays eggs in temporary bodies of water. The tadpoles are yellow with stripes.

[[Reassortment]]

CATEGORIES: DNA, Diseases caused by viruses

Reassortment is mixing of the genetic material of a species into new combinations in different individuals. 

There are several ways this happens. The term is  used when two similar viruses infecting the same cell exchange genetic material. In particular, reassortment occurs among influenza viruses. Their genomes have eight segments of RNA. These segments act like mini-chromosomes: each time a flu virus is assembled, it needs one copy of each segment.

A single host (a human, a chicken, or other animal) may be infected by two different strains of the influenza virus. Then it is possible that new assembled viral particles will be made from segments whose origin is mixed, some coming from one strain and some coming from another. The new reassorted strain will share properties from both  parental lineages.

Reassortment is responsible for some of the major changes in the history of the influenza virus. The 1957 and 1968 pandemic flu strains were caused by reassortment between an avian virus and a human virus. The H1N1 virus responsible for the 2009 swine flu pandemic has an unusual mix of swine, avian and human influenza genetic sequences.

There are other examples, but this is enough to indicate why reassortment causes such dangerous illness.  

If any of a virus’s genome segments is damaged in such a way as to prevent replication or expression of an essential gene, the virus is inviable when it, alone, infects a host cell (single infection).  However when two or more damaged viruses infect the same cell (multiple infection), the infection may succeed due to reassortment of segments. Each of the eight genome segments may be present in at least one undamaged copy.

[[Cleon]]

CATEGORIES: 422 BC deaths, Ancient Greek politicians, Generals, Year of birth unknown

Cleon (ˈ; Κλέων Kleon, kléɔːn; died 422 BCE) was an Athenian politician and general known for his support of the Peloponnesian War. The historian Thucydides writes that Cleon was a demagogue and that he once ordered the Athenians to massacre an entire city for rebelling against Athens.

Cleon also dragged Aristophanes to court to prosecute him for his play The Babylonians. Aristophanes at the beginning of his next play The Acharnians said he would have revenge on Cleon. Aristophanes also wrote a comedy called The Knights to try and convince the people not to re-elect Cleon and another called The Wasps about Cleon being a populist.

According to Aristotle, Cleon was the first one who would shout down anyone who disagreed with him and accuse any and all opponents of being essentially traitors to ‘the people’ and who did everything he could to convince the people that the only way for them to have power was to let him do what he wanted even if it were against the Constitution.

[[Pinocchio frog]]

CATEGORIES: Animals of Oceania, Frogs

The Pinocchio frog or northern Pinocchio treefrog (Litoria pinocchio) is a frog from the island of New Guinea. It lives in the Foja Mountains in Indonesia.

This frog is green, brown and yellow in color.  The male frog has a point on the end of its nose.  The point can get bigger or smaller at different times, but scientists do not know exactly why.

Scientists saw that the point on the male frog's nose becomes bigger while the male frog is singing, so they think it might be part of impressing female frogs.  Other scientists think it makes it easier for Pinocchio frogs to recognize other Pinocchio frogs and tell them apart from other frogs that look similar and live in the same place.

The Pinocchio frog is named after the fictional character Pinocchio, a puppet whose nose becomes bigger whenever he tells a lie.  Scientists have known the Pinocchio frog existed since at least 2008.  It was first formally described, meaning scientists wrote the first scientific paper about it, in 2019.

They were killed on a small dirt road in a rural part of Sumter County, South Carolina on August 9, 1976. They were named as Pamela Buckley and James Freund on January 21, 2021, at a press conference. They were both shot three times in the same way. Twice in the chest, and once in the back. They were shot with a .357 caliber revolver.

The male victim, James, was aged 29. It was guessed he was between 18 and 30 before his name was known. One dentist said he thought he could have been older than 27. His skin was an olive white colour and he had brown eyes and brown hair down to his shoulders. He was over 6 tall and weighed around 150. He had a lot of work done to his teeth that was probably done outside the United States. He also had many scars on his back and shoulders, meaning he might have played contact sport. He was wearing faded Levi jeans and a red T-shirt. The shirt had the words "Coors — America's Light Beer" on the front and "Camel Challenger GT Sebring '75" on the back. It also had a Snoopy design. The shirt came from the Sebring Races being held at the time in Sebring, Florida, meaning he may have been there. He was wearing no underwear and had a pack of matches in his pocket from a "Grant's Truck Stop". This truck stop is thought to be in the Midwestern United States. He also had a ring on with the letters "JPF" written on the inside. This could refer to his initials James Paul Freund.

The female victim, Pamela Buckley, was thought to be younger than the male one, aged between 18 and 25 years old before her name was known. It was later found out that Buckley was 24 years old. She had reddish-brown hair down to her shoulders and blue or gray eyes. She had two moles on the left of her face. She had no scars and had never been pregnant. She also had not shaved her legs. She was wearing a white muslin blouse over a pink halter top. She also wore blue denim cut-off shorts. She had purple and pink Stride-Rite brand wedge-heeled sandals. Like the male victim, she was wearing no underwear.

Pictures, drawings and photographs of the pair were spread all around the U.S.. DNA testing found that they were not related to each other in 2007. in 2014, Police paused the investigation until it was known who the pair were.

They were buried in graves marked "Male Unknown" and "Female Unknown" at the Bethel United Methodist Church Cemetery in Oswego, South Carolina on August 14, 1977. This was around a year after they had died.

Prosperity theology is a religious belief that if the believer is wealthy and in good health, this is always the will of God. It most common among certain groups of Protestant Christians. It is also known as  prosperity gospel, the health and wealth gospel, the gospel of success, or seed faith.A These groups also believe that faith, positive speech, and donations to religious causes will increase one's material wealth. Prosperity theology sees the Bible as a contract between God and humans: if humans have faith in God, he will deliver security and prosperity.

The doctrine says that it  is God's will for his people to be blessed. The atonement  is interpreted to include the healing of sickness and lessening of poverty. Both are curses that can be broken by faith. This is believed to be achieved through donations of money, visualization, and positive confession.

Groups in favor of prosperity theology started in the United States in the 1950s. The origins may go back to a movement callled New Thought, which started in the 19th century. The basic ideas were important for another movement, called Word of Faith.  In the  1980s televangelism was sometimes successful because of these ideas.  In the 1990s and 2000s, prosperity theology was adopted by influential leaders in the Pentecostal Movement and Charismatic Movement in the United States and has spread throughout the world. Prominent leaders in the development of prosperity theology include E.&nbsp;W. Kenyon, Oral Roberts,  A.&nbsp;A. Allen, Robert Tilton, T.&nbsp;L. Osborn, Joel Osteen, Creflo Dollar,8 Kenneth Copeland,  Reverend Ike, and Kenneth Hagin. 

Leaders from other Christian novements have critiziced prosperity theology:  They say  that it is irresponsible, promotes idolatry, and is contrary to scripture. Secular as well as some Christian observers have also criticized prosperity theology: They say it exploits the poor. The practices of some preachers have attracted scandal and some have been charged with financial fraud.

[[Navajo language]]

CATEGORIES: Languages of the United States

The Navajo language (Navajo: Diné Bizaad) is a Southern Athabaskan language that is spoken in the United States, specifically in the Navajo Nation (in the states of Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah). It is the most widely spoken Native American language in the US and the most spoken Indigenous language in the Americas north of the US-Mexico border. In 2011, almost 170,000 Americans spoke Navajo at home. Navajo is famous for being used by the Navajo Code Talkers during World War II. 

Compared to many other languages, the Navajo language has a lot of sounds, including many that are not found in the English language. Navajo is also a tonal language, like Chinese, which means that pitch is used to make words different from each other. English is not a tonal language. For these reasons and many more, many English speakers find it difficult to learn Navajo.

In Navajo, new words are made by adding prefixes and suffixes to a part of a word called the stem. These prefixes and suffixes add meaning, such as tense, who is doing the action, and so on. In Navajo, sentences are arranged as subject-object-verb although they can be arranged in other ways too.

Navajo does not have a lot of loanwords from other languages.

The Navajo language is written with the Latin alphabet, just like English. The current alphabet was developed in the 1930s. Before this, the Navajo did not have their own alphabet.

Edward Norton Lorenz (May 23, 1917 – April 16, 2008) was an American mathematician and meteorologist. He was one of the first to work in the field of Chaos theory. He was the first to use the term Butterfly effect for dynamic systems that are very sensitive to starting conditions. In the 1960s, he used a simple model for weather prediction, which he simialated on a computer.  With this setup, he discovered that only a slight change of the values he used for the model could lead to totally different results. This is known as Butterfly effect.  In numerical weather predicion, values are often rounded, so that in each step, a small error is added.

He also discovered and developed the mathematical foundations. For his simulations he used a system of equations, which is now named after him.

[[Revealed frog]]

CATEGORIES: Animals of Australia, Frogs

The revealed frog, orange-thighed tree frog or whirring tree frog (Litoria revelata) is a frog from Australia.  It is related to the brown tree frog. It lives in three different places in Queensland and New South Wales, but scientists think the frogs living in different places might be different species.

The male frog is 2.6 to 2.8 cm long.  The female is 3.0 to 3.6 cm long.

This frog can live in swamps near the coast up to rainforests in the mountains. Scientists say people can tell whether a frog is a revealed frog by looking at it because it has much larger discs at the ends of its toes than other frogs do and because it sometimes has black spots on its middle.  People can tell it apart from other frogs by listening to it because its voice is around 4 Hz.  It has long legs and a stripe from its nose to each armpit.  It is cream-brown or red-brown in colour.  It may have orange on its legs.

Scientists knew this frog existed in at least the 1960s, but it was first formally described, meaning scientists wrote the first formal paper about it, in 1982.

It lays its eggs in still water.

This frog is not endangered but people do damage its habitat by removing trees and bringing cows there to eat the grass.

[[M1 carbine]]

CATEGORIES: Rifles

The M1 carbine is a short, lightweight semi-automatic rifle, or a carbine, used in the United States military from World War II until late in the Vietnam War. It was made to arm soldiers with less of a combat role and more of a support role, such as medics and radiomen. The kind of weapon the military wanted was a gun that would be more powerful and accurate than the M1911, but shorter and lighter than the M1 Garand. The M1 Garand was too long and heavy for support troops to carry, especially since combat was not their main job.

Even though the M1 carbine looks similar to the M1 Garand, the two guns are actually very different. First, the M1 carbines bullets, the .30 Carbine, are much smaller and lighter than the Garand's .30-06 bullets. Second, the gun itself is much lighter, smaller, and shorter range than the Garand. The M1 carbine weighs less than half of the Garand. Third, the M1 carbine is loaded with box magazines that holds 15 bullets, while the M1 Garand is loaded with clips that hold 8 bullets.

Even though it is not used by the military anymore, it is still popular with civilians.

The M2 carbine is a selective fire version of the M1, which means it can switch between semi-automatic and full automatic fire.

[[Iriomote cat]]

CATEGORIES: Animals of Japan, Cats

The Iriomote cat (Prionailurus bengalensis iriomotensis) is a wildcat that lives only on Iriomote Island in Japan.  It is a subspecies of the leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis). In Japanese, people call it yamaneko, or "mountain cat."

This cat is a little larger than a domestic cat, with rounder ears and spots where a tabby cat would have stripes.

These cats live in forests and on hills with streams.  They have been seen on beaches.  They can climb trees and swim. There are almost no small mammals on Iriomote Island, so the cats cannot eat mice or other rodents the way wildcats in other places do.  They eat many different kinds of things, for example insects, lizards, fish, and shrimp.

The females give birth to 1-4 kittens at a time in dens in trees or in crevices in rocks.  People have seen kittens as young as three months living on their own.  Scientists think it takes 10-12 months for them to become adults.

Ecologist Masako Izawa of the University of the Ryukyus in Okinawa said she thinks there are fewer than 1000 Iromote cats in the wild.  There may be only 100. This cat is endangered because of habitat loss, meaning that human beings build things in the places where they live.  Some cats are hit by cars when they come to the road to eat dead frogs, dead lizards, and other animals that have been killed by cars.  They are also endangered because domestic cats mate with them.  Veterinarians have taught people on Iriomote Island to spay and neuter their pet cats to prevent this, the local government has tried to stop people from driving too fast and the government of Japan has made part of Iriomote Island a wildlife protection area.

For a time in the 1970s, the people who lived on Iriomote Island said the government of Japan thought the cats were more important than they were.  One German scientist had asked the government of Japan to make all the human beings leave the island to protect the cat.  Other scientists showed, however, that the cat can live next to humans and is not afraid to look for food near farms and rice paddies.  In 2019, many Iriomote islanders said they were proud of their rare wildcat, though they worried that too many tourists would come to their island and damage it.

The Appalachian National Scenic Trail, often called the Appalachian Trail or the A.T., is a hiking trail in the eastern United States.  The trail goes between Springer Mountain in Georgia and Mount Katahdin in Maine. The trail is about 2,200 long. The exact length changes over time as parts are changed. The Appalachian Trail Conservancy says  the Appalachian Trail is the longest hiking-only trail in the world. More than 2 million people hike on part of the trail at least once each year.

The idea of the Appalachian Trail started in 1921. The trail was completed in 1937 after more than ten years of work. Changes to the trail still happen every year. Thirty-one trail clubs and many partners help keep it usable.  The National Park Service, United States Forest Service, and the nonprofit Appalachian Trail Conservancy manage it. Most of the trail is in forest or wild lands. Some parts go through towns, roads and farms. It passes through 14 states: Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine.

Thru-hikers attempt to hike the whole trail in one season. The number of thru-hikes per year has increased steadily. In 2017, 715 northbound and 133 southbound thru-hikes were reported. Many books, documentaries, websites, and fan organizations are dedicated to the hike. Some people hike from one end to the other, then turn around and thru-hike the trail the other way.  This is known as a "yo-yo".

Bush began the campaign as the front runner among Republicans because many people knew his name, high funds, and control of the governorship of Texas and polls starting in 1997 showed Bush leading every opponent by double digits. 

The main challenger to Bush was Senator John McCain, who appealed to moderate Republicans.

Bush won the majority of the primaries and after the March 2000 Super Tuesday contests he was well ahead in delegates of both McCain and Alan Keyes. On August 3, 2000 Bush won the Republican nomination at the Republican Convention with the support of 2,058 delegates. Dick Cheney, the former U.S. Secretary of Defense, was nominated as vice president despite Cheney recommending former Missouri Senator John Danforth.

Throughout the majority of the primary and general campaign seasons Bush was leading Gore in the polls. On November 7, 2000, it was projected that Bush had won in Florida and its 25 electoral votes. 

Gore won the national popular vote but the Gore campaign lost the electoral college vote after a legal battle over disputed vote counts. Bush won the election on the electoral college vote of 271 to 266.

CATEGORIES: Barack Obama, United States presidential campaigns

The 2012 reelection campaign of Barack Obama, the 44th President of the United States, was formally announced on April 4, 2011. Along with his running mate, Vice President Joe Biden.

Barack Obama ran in the general election against former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, along with many minor candidates from other parties.  The election took place on Tuesday, November 6, 2012.

Obama's campaign headquarters was in Chicago and key members of his successful campaign in 2008, such as Jim Messina and David Axelrod, returned to staff it.

On the day of the announcement, the campaign released a promotional video showing supporters of Obama organizing for the re-election effort. As The Guardian newspaper noted, this was the first U.S. presidential reelection campaign to use Facebook and Twitter for promotion.

Between early-2011 and June 30, 2012, the Obama campaign and supporters spent about $400 million, according to the Federal Election Commission. Obama won his reelection bid by a margin of 51.06 to 47.21%. This was the first time since 1944, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt won re-election, that a Democratic president had won by a majority of the electoral votes and over 51% of the popular vote twice.

CATEGORIES: United States presidential campaigns

The 1988 presidential campaign of Michael Dukakis began when he announced his candidacy for the Democratic Party's 1988 presidential nomination on March 16, 1987, in a speech in Boston. 

After winning the nomination, he became the Democratic Party's nominee at the party's convention in Atlanta, Georgia on July 21, 1988. He lost the 1988 election to his Republican opponent George H. W. Bush, who was the sitting Vice President at the time. 

Dukakis won 10 states and the District of Columbia, receiving a total of 111 electoral votes compared to Bush's 426 (Dukakis would have received 112, but one faithless elector who was pledged to him voted for Bentsen for president and Dukakis for vice president instead out of protest). Dukakis received 46% of the popular vote to Bush's 54%. 

Many commentators blamed Dukakis' loss on the embarrassing photograph of him in a tank taken on September 13, 1988. Much of the blame was also laid on Dukakis' campaign, which was criticized for being poorly managed despite being well funded. 

He would have been the first Greek American President.

[[Telugu wedding ceremony]]

The Telugu Hindu wedding ceremony  is the traditional wedding ceremony of the Telugu people in India.The cenermony can last several days. In the 19th century, some ceremonies lasted up to sixteen days.  Modern ceremonies can still last two days or more. The caste of the bride and the groom are important  for the ceremony.  The pendli or wedding is considered the strongest of social bonds. It is said to spiritually merge two souls opening the doors to gruhastaashramam (household life). There is a Telugu saying that "Marriage is supposed to be a family union and not an individual formality."

Telugu marriage is sanctified by seven pledges made by the bride and groom. It  begins when the bride and groom have completed seven turns around a sacred fire.  Many of the gestures have a symbolic importance They are common in the ceremony and ensure that the bride and groom are united in the presence of Panchabhutaalu —five essential elements for life, namely: Bhumi (earth), Akaasham (sky), Agni (fire), Neeru (water) and Vaayuvu (air). The ceremony is held under a Kaḷyāṇa Maṇḍapaṃ or wedding pavilion decorated with fresh flowers. The Nādasvaram (also called the Shehnai in North India) is an Indian musical instrument that traditionally accompanies most Telugu weddings.

Each element in the ceremony is connected and is given special importance. Historically, the groom would ride an elephant to the bride's home where the wedding is supposed to take place. This practice is called Gajaarohana. Today this tradition is declining. Some marriage ceremonies are held in a temple in the presence of god, but most are conducted outside because of the number of people at the ceremony. After every ceremony, they serve food to all the guests, which is also the main part of the culture of offering food to anyone. It is also a tradition to eat ice cream or sweets after dinner because it is considered auspicious. All the rituals conducted throughout the Telugu wedding ceremony have a religious significance.

The decorations mostly consist of rich colourful flowers and mango leaves. Families renovate their houses and invite all the guests going to each of their houses by the use of kumkuma (colourful, decorative powder).

[[Serial comma]]

CATEGORIES: Punctuation

The Oxford comma or serial comma is a comma. It is sometimes used directly after the second-to-last item in a list of three or more items. For example, a list of three people may be shown as "Alice, Bob, and Charlie" (with the comma) or "Alice, Bob and Charlie" (without the comma).

Some style guides prefer using the comma, while others advise against it. It may sometimes be useful to add the comma to avoid confusion. For example, a sentence such as "Please bring Marcus, a musician and a skater to the dinner event today" may confuse anyone reading that sentence. Without the Oxford comma, they might think that Marcus is a musician and a skater, so they would need to bring Marcus instead of three people to that dinner event today.

When following a style guide that opposes the comma, one can rearrange the terms to avoid confusion. For example, saying "a musician, a skater and Marcus" does not change the intended meaning, but it avoids the confusion.

[[Kongonaphon]]

CATEGORIES: Fossils, Reptiles, Madagascar

Kongonaphon is an early member of the dinosaur–pterosaur clade Ornithodira. It is a small reptile-type fossil found in the 

Middle to Late Triassic of Madagascar. It was probably an insectivore, based on the shape and texture of its teeth.

Kongonaphon is notable for its tiny size, even compared to other small early avemetatarsalia. The femur was only about 4 cm (1.6 inches) long, and the total height of the animal was about 10 cm (3.9 inches). 

It has long been thought that early members of the group were small. If they were as small as this, then a miniaturization event occurred near the base of the avian stem lineage. Also the small size explains the origin of body covering ("integument", hair on the body of dinosaurs and feathers on birds). Tiny creatures are most vulnerable to changes in external temperature.

[[Knuckle-walk]]

CATEGORIES: Transport, Evolution

Knuckle-walk or knuckle-walking is a way some land animals move.  Knuckle-walking animals curl fingers or front toes like a fist and touch the ground using the bony part of the front foot, the knuckle.  Gorillas, chimpanzees, anteaters and platypuses knuckle-walk. In general, animals knuckle walk if their hands or front paws have special shapes for doing something very different from walking.  Apes use their hands to hold food and use tools, so they have fingers. They curl up their fingers when they knuckle-walk.  Anteaters use their front paws to dig for ants, so they curl up their digging claws when they knuckle-walk.  Platypuses use their front paws to swim, so they curl up their webbed toes when they knuckle-walk.

Large anteaters that walk on the ground, for example the giant anteater, knuckle-walk.  Smaller anteaters that live in trees do not. Platypuses walk on their knuckles so that the webbing on their front feet will not get in the way.

Gorillas from the genus Gorilla and chimpanzees from the genus Pan both walk on their knuckles but not in the same way.  Chimpanzees spend more time in trees than gorillas do, so they turn their wrists in many different ways.  Gorillas usually keep their wrists straight when they knuckle-walk.  Gorillas and chimpanzees knuckle-walk when they move on the ground because their bodies are adapted to move around in trees: their arms are longer than their legs, and their middles are cone-shaped.  The bones in their arms are good for knuckle-walking: the radius can lock into one of the bones in the wrist so the two bones together can hold the animal's weight. Human arm and wrist bones do not do this.

Some fictional cavemen knuckle-walk or drag the knuckles of their long arms on the ground, but scientists do not agree on whether human beings evolved from ancestors who really knuckle-walked on the ground the way gorillas do.  One team of scientists said humans evolved from a tree-living ancestor, like chimpanzees did, because of the way our wrist bones are. Another team of scientists wrote that Australopithecus anamensis and Australopithecus afarensis, extinct relatives of humans, probably knuckle-walked.

[[Saluga and Ghazal protected area]]

CATEGORIES: Protected areas, Geography of Egypt

Saluga and Ghazal protected area is one of the nature reserves in southern Egypt and is considered the smallest, as its area does not exceed half a kilometer in the form of islands groups  in the Nile River. 

The reserve is located in Aswan Governorate, specifically at the first waterfall, about 3 km north of Aswan Reservoir. In south of it, there is the island of Suhail, and to the north there are the islands of Esposarte, Amun and the Botanical Garden (El Nabatat Island).

The name is taken from the two most important islands in the reserve. Saluja Island, which means (waterfall) in Nubian language, while the name Ghazal Island seems to refer to one of the ancient plants that were growing on these islands.

The region declared a nature reserve by decision of the Prime Minister of Egypt in 1986. With the aim of preserving the biological diversity of endangered animals, plants and mammals.

==The Environment== 

The reserve contains a variety of living creatures from the animal and plant kingdoms despite the small size of the reserve and its presence in the middle of the Nile. Among the most famous animals in the reserve are camels, goats, wild donkeys, hyenas, and the red fox (the Egyptian fox) which, although it does not live mainly in the islands of the reserve but lives in the West Bank of the Nile and crosses the river by swimming to build a hole on the islands of the reserve. Sixty species of resident and migratory birds live in the reserve as well, some of which are threatened with extinction. The most famous of these rare birds is the black ibis, which became the symbol of the reserve. The plant life in the reserve is more varied and clear, as there are more than 90 different types of plants. The reserve is characterized by stunning landscapes that combine the often quiet vegetation with the water surface of the Nile, which made it an important tourist attraction.

CATEGORIES: Transgender

Deadnaming is using a name (called a "deadname") that a transgender person used before transitioning without their permission. It is called that because the person who that name belongs to is considered "dead" and is now a brand-new person. 

Sometimes, people deadname another person by accident. They may know the other person before they transitioned. Other times, people deadname other people on purpose. Using a person's deadname is considered to be very disrespectful because it ignores a person's gender identity and is a type of transphobia if it happens on purpose. Some people think that deadnaming is a form of violence.

[[Big Five]]

CATEGORIES: Banks, Economy of Canada

Big Five is the name colloquially given to the five largest banks that dominate the banking industry of Canada. All five banks are operationally based in Toronto. All five banks are classified as Schedule I banks that are domestic banks operating in Canada under government charter. The banks' shares are widely held, with any entity allowed to hold a maximum of twenty percent.

The Big Five are among the world's strongest banks, with Toronto-Dominion Bank, Royal Bank of Canada, Scotiabank, Bank of Montreal & Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce at 11th, 15th, 21st, 28th & 29th place, respectively.

In modern history, Royal Bank has always been the largest by a significant margin, although TD Bank has overtaken RBC in recent years. Up to the late 1990s, CIBC was the second largest, followed by Bank of Montreal, Scotiabank, and TD Bank. During the late 1990s and beyond, this ranking changed due to several reorganizations. Royal Bank acquired Royal Trust in 1993, while Scotiabank purchased National Trust in 1997. As Scotiabank found no merger partners among the other banks in the big five group, it instead expanded its international operations and passed the Bank of Montreal in size. TD Bank merged with Canada Trust, which was for a long time the largest trust in Canada, thus vaulting TD into the number one spot. There has been no major changes to Bank of Montreal. CIBC's first unsuccessful foray into the US market led it to shed its assets there, dropping it to the number five spot.

[[Nyctimystes]]

CATEGORIES: Frogs

Nyctimystes is a genus of tree frogs in the family Pelodryadidae. Most of them are from Papua New Guinea but some live on the Moluccas islands.  Some scientists think Nyctimystes should be considered part of Litoria, another genus of frogs from New Guinea.  Other scientists think that it is right to say Nyctimystes is its own genus.

All frogs in Nyctimystes have marks on their lower eyelids: lines, veins, or dots. Scientists think this helps the frog harder to see so it can hide from larger animals that want to eat it.  Scientists tell Nyctimystes frogs apart from Litoria frogs because Nyctimystes frogs have vertical (up and down) pupils in their eyes and Litoria frogs have horizontal (side to side) pupils in their eyes.

These frogs live in tropical or subtropical rainforests on mountains. Their eggs are large and scientists have seen many of them laying eggs on underwater objects in fast-flowing creeks and streams, enough that they think all Nyctimystes frogs do this. The tadpoles have large sucker-mouths and streamlined bodies with large, muscular tails. All Nyctimystes frogs have webbed feet and large discs on their toes for climbing.

Scientists say most Nyctimystes frogs became separate species during the Miocene era, about 10 to 22 million years ago.

The name comes from the Greek nycktos for "night" and myst meaning "mist." Together they refer to "mysteries of the night."

[[School discipline]]

CATEGORIES: Education

When a student or group of students show behaviour that disrupts the current activity, or that goes against rules of the school,  a teacher or the school can take action. This action is usually called school discipline.  Discipline can guide the children's behaviour or set limits to help them learn to take better care of themselves, other people and the world around them.

Every school has a set of rules and if students break these rules they are subject to discipline. For example, these rules may say that pupils (students) need to wear a school uniform, and what the school uniform must look like.  They usually also say that school starts at a given time, and that pupils must be present at the school, at that time. If pupils do not follow the rules, they will be punished. The term "discipline" is applied to the punishment that is the consequence of breaking the rules. The aim of discipline is to set limits restricting certain behaviors or attitudes that are seen as harmful or against the school policies, educational norms, school traditions, etc. In the early days of schools, it was common to punish people if they did not follow the rules set by the school. In more recent times, other approaches have also been tried, such as rewarding good behavior.

[[Canadian Indian residential school system]]

CATEGORIES: History of Canada, History of Native Americans, Schools in Canada

Until 1996, Indigenous  children in Canada were forced to go to boarding schools in order to make them assimilate into white Canadian society. The Indian  residential school system refers to the group of these schools for First Nations children. These schools were run by Christian churches and got money from the Canadian government. These schools existed for over 100 years and more than 150,000 children were in them. Of these children, at least 3,200 died.

Many residential schools were started when the Indian Act was passed in 1876. In 1896, a change was made to the Act so that all First Nations children had to go to school. A lot of their communities were located far away from schools, so they had to go to residential schools and live there for the school year. These schools were usually very far away from their families in order to encourage them to assimilate. There were residential schools in every province and territory except for New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island.

At these schools, these children were forced to give up their cultures. They were given new names and were not allowed to speak their mother tongues or visit their families. They were abused at these schools and were not treated well. When these children graduated from these schools, they did not fit into their Indigenous communities or into mainstream Canadian society. They did not learn the skills needed to survive off the land. At the same time, these schools did not teach them how to skills on how to live in cities or stop the students from becoming victims of racism. Studies have shown that these students and their children and grandchildren are more likely to have problems such as PTSD, alcoholism, drug use, and suicide than kids who did not go to residential schools.

In 2008, Prime Minister Stephen Harper apologized to the survivors of the residential schools on behalf of the Canadian government. The government also set up the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) in order to learn the truth about what happened at these schools. Many survivors came and talked about their experiences. In 2015, the TRC published a report that said the residential school system was cultural genocide.

[[Unconventional warfare]]

CATEGORIES: Terrorism, War, Conflicts

Unconventional warfare is any kind of war that does not fit the traditional war between nations or groups. It includes foreign resistance movements and guerilla groups, who fight against an occupying force or their own government. 

In conventional warfare, the fighters usually wear uniforms, which identifies them as fighters in an army, under the laws of war. With unconventional warfare, this is not the case. Those engaging in unconventional warfare need to hide before they can launch an attack. This means that in most cases they do not wear specific uniforms which identify them as fighters. Struggles of this type are going on at present in parts of Africa.

An unconventional war is rarely announced as a war. No declaration of war is made. Usually, the only feature which is noticed is the presence in a country of organised fighters. The fighters come from a neighbouring country or from parts of the existing country. There are no set rules. 

This kind of warfare has been quite common since 1900. Terrorism is the intimidation of the native civilian population by armed fighters or insurgents, often known as guerrillas. Warfare inside a state by citizens who wish to overthrow the state, also generally called terrorism by the government, has also been common.

Struggle between regular forces (armies in uniforms) may happen without a formal declaration of war. Red versus white after the end of royal rule in Russia (Russian Civil War) is a good example. It was a semi-formal war, fought with regular troops on both sides. So was the seizing of Manchuria (Manchukuo) by Japan in the early 1930s. Regular Japanese army forces were used.

After World War I and World War II unconventional forces were used to drive out colonial powers or to try and do so. The struggle against colonialism was usually by irregular forces supported by weapons and men from powers interested in removing the colonies (usually Russia or China).

The dividing line between conventional and unconventional warfare is not clear-cut. In general conventional war is fought between regular armies, navies, air forces. Unconventional warfare is usually fought on the ground with at least one side not in uniform, usually against forces of the established government. It is an attempt to overthrow a government or to replace in it some part of the country.

The Mali War has been ongoing since 2012. The war has three sides. One side is Mali, who are supported by many other countries. Another, many of whom are Tuareg people, are separatists who want northern Mali - which they call Azawad - to become a separate country. Northern Mali is hot desert and is in the southern part of the Sahara. The third side is Islamist groups - including Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and al-Qaeda - who want Mali to be part of an Islamist caliphate.

The United Nations has reported many human rights violations, both by the forces close to the government, and by the different rebel groups. Allegedly, there have been amputations, floggings, and extrajudicial executions. A couple was stoned in 2012, for allegedly having an extramarital affair. Based on these reports, the International Criminal Court started investigations into war crimes and human rights abuses. According to the BBC, about 250,000 people have left because of the fighting. They are now refugees and internally displaced people. Another problem is that World Heritage Sites are threatened by the war. There are mosques built of mud, in Timbuktu, which are threatened. In September 2021, a contract was signed between the Malian state and a private Russian military company linked to the Russian military group Wagner. The document provides for the deployment of mercenaries in the country, in liaison with the Malian army, and the protection of senior figures.

[[English football league system]]

CATEGORIES: Football in England, Football league systems

The English football league system is a series of leagues that are connected for men's association football clubs in England. Five teams also come from Wales, one team comes from Guernsey and one comes from Jersey. It is also called the football pyramid. The system has a hierarchical format. It has promotion and relegation between leagues at different levels. This means that in theory, even the smallest club can get to the top of the system. In the system, there are more than 140 leagues, and more than 480 divisions.

The total number of clubs changes every year. This is because clubs join and stop playing in leagues. Sometimes it is also because a club stops existing or merges with another club. An average of 15 clubs per division means that more than 7,000 teams of nearly 5,300 clubs are in a league in the English men's football league system.

There are no official definitions of any level below 11. This means that the structure at level 12 and below is not definitive.

The pyramid for women's football in England is not the same. It has nine levels. Also, some English men's football clubs play outside the English football league system.

Many liberal arts colleges teach only undergraduate students, but some also offer graduate programs that lead to a master's degree or doctoral degree. The term "liberal arts college" most often describes an independent college, but it may also sometimes describe a college within a larger university. Most liberal arts colleges outside the United States are like this.

[[Browning Hi-Power]]

CATEGORIES: Pistols

The Browning Hi-Power is a semi-automatic pistol first made by John Browning, then finished by FN Herstal (a Belgian gun company) in 1935 after Browning's death. There are 9x19mm Parabellum models and .40 S&W models of the gun. Although the gun was largely based on the M1911, there were several major changes made. Since it was finished outside the United States and since it fired the non-American 9mm bullet, the Hi-Power was not used very much in the US. However, it was very popular outside the US. In fact, it was one of the most used military pistols ever. As of 2017, it was still being used or was only recently replaced in over 50 countries.

The Browning Hi-Power has many other names such as the HP, BAP, BHP, GP, P-35, and HP-35. It was called the "Hi-Power" because it could hold a large number of bullets. It could hold 13 9mm bullets when other pistols at the time held far fewer. For example, the Luger only held 8 bullets and the M1911 only held 7.

[[Cryptographic anchor]]

CATEGORIES: Technology

A cryptographic anchor (also "crypto-anchor") is a unique identifier (or "fingerprint") that can be put into products and cannot be removed or changed.  Crypto-anchors can be tiny computers or optical codes.  This means they can even be put into a dye.  The cryptographic anchor is connected to a blockchain.  Its uses include prevention or detection of fraud as well as product tracing.

IBM has worked on developing cryptographic anchors.  Proposed uses include labeling a pill (the code for the dye would become visible when touched with water) and marking fluids.  The reason for using these anchors is to ensure the authenticity of products.  The suggested cost of these tiny  (smaller than a salt grain) items was projected at less than ten U.S. cents.

Giulio Prisco  wrote that "The cryptographic anchors project is considered a starting point for developing technologies complementary to the Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain solutions for medical devices and pharmaceutical products, able to provide scalable end-to-end security across a supply chain — from the manufacturers right down to consumers and patients.

"A typical application envisioned by IBM is fighting product fraud. IBM’s crypto-anchors can authenticate a product’s origin and contents, ensuring it matches the record stored in the blockchain."

Prisco wrote that in 2018 IBM was predicting widespread use within five years.

The FN P90 is a very short personal defense weapon made by FN Herstal.

The P90 has a rare feature where the box magazine is loaded parallel to the gun's barrel rather than perpendicular to it. Each magazine can hold 50 bullets. The P90 fires at a fast 900 rounds per minute (RPM). The P90 is fully ambidextrous, which means both right-handed and left-handed people can use the gun without any problems. It weighs only 2.6 kilograms (5.6 pounds) and is only 50.5 centimeters (19.9 inches) long. It is even small and light enough to fire with one hand.

[[FN Five-seven]]

CATEGORIES: Pistols

The FN Five-seven, marketed as the Five-seveN, is an armor-piercing semi-automatic pistol made by the Belgian gun company FN Herstal. It fires the FN 5.7x28mm bullet, where the gun itself gets its name. It was made around the same time as the FN P90 PDW. Although the FN 5.7x28mm bullet is small, it has low recoil, high stopping power, high accuracy, armor-piercing abilities, and long range because of its high muzzle velocity. The small size of the bullet also allows for the gun's box magazines to hold many bullets, with a normal magazine holding 20 bullets. It is popular with militaries and police forces worldwide. However, its ability to shoot through body armor and the high number of bullets it can carry make it a very controversial gun in the United States for civilian use. The Five-seven can be seen in video games like the Splinter Cell series, Counter-Strike, the Rainbow Six series, the Battlefield (series), and the Call of Duty series.

[[Heckler & Koch PSG-1]]

CATEGORIES: 7.62 mm rifles, Rifles of the Cold War

The Heckler & Koch PSG-1 is a semi-automatic sniper rifle. It is made by the German gun company Heckler & Koch. PSG-1 is a shortening of the German word Präzisionsschützengewehr-1, or literally the "precision-shooting rifle". It fires the 7.62x51mm NATO bullet. It is a heavily changed version of the G3 rifle. The Munich massacre during the 1972 Summer Olympics showed the need for West German police and counter-terrorists to have a precision rifle, which West Germany did not have at the time.

The PSG-1 is very accurate and has a large 20-round box magazine. However, its heavy weight, high price, lack of versatility, and its ease of jamming made the rifle not very practical, so it was eventually replaced by other sniper rifles.  However, its unique look made it a popular weapon in video games. It appeared in games like the Metal Gear series, the Call of Duty series, the Rainbow Six series, and Resident Evil 5.

[[Revenge porn]]

CATEGORIES: Hate crimes, Law, Pornography

Revenge pornography is the act of getting revenge toward somebody by way of pornography. This act of revenge is usually done without asking the victim. 

Revenge porn usually means making sexually explicit videos, books and movies about a person because the person ended a relationship. The possession of the material may be used by the partners to punish the victim for ending a relationship.

Several areas have passed laws against revenge porn. They include Israel, Canada, Australia, United Kingdom and most of the 

United States.

In the 1980s the Hustler magazine began a monthly show of reader-submitted images of naked women called the "Beaver Hunt". The Beaver Hunt photos were usually with details of these women, such as their hobby and their names. Some of the women sued the magazine for publishing their photos without their permission.

But it wasn't until 2010 that revenge porn really took off. That year, 

Hunter Moore launched the website IsAnyoneUp. The website was similar to the Beaver Hunt. The first person who spoke against Moore was activist Charlotte Laws. She was also one of the first people to publicly support revenge pornography victims.

In June 2015 Google decided they would remove links to revenge porn on request. Microsoft did the same in July.
