[[Pericles' Funeral Oration]]

CATEGORIES: Ancient Greece

Pericles' Funeral Oration is a famous speech from Thucydides' History of the Peloponnesian War.  The speech was delivered by Pericles at the end of the first year of the Peloponnesian War (431 - 404 BCE). He was a famous Athenian politician. The speech was a part of the yearly public funeral for the people who died in the war.

At that time, people in Athens had a custom of holding a public funeral for the people who died in war.  The bodies of the dead were left out for three days in a tent, where offerings could be made for the dead.

Funeral Oration was recorded by Thucydides in book two of his History of the Peloponnesian War. Thucydides records the speech as if every word in the record was what Pericles said. However, people agree he did, at least, correct or change the speeches a little. Thucydides says in his History that the speeches are not completely the same as what was really said, but written to show the main ideas of what was said.  It is quite certain that Pericles delivered a speech at the end of the first year of the war. However, people are not sure how much Thucydides' record is the same as Pericles' actual speech.

The Funeral Oration is important because the speech was different from usual Athenian funeral speeches. David Cartwright describes it as "a eulogy (description) of Athens itself...". The speech is about what great things Athens did, delivered to encourage the people.

[[Gustave Courbet]]

CATEGORIES: 1819 births, 1877 deaths, Deaths from liver disease, French painters

Jean Désiré Gustave Courbet (10 June 1819–31 December 1877) was a French painter. He was the leader of the Realist movement in 19th-century French painting. Courbet is very important in French painting for two reasons. Firstly, he was prepared to try out new ideas and ways of painting. Secondly, his paintings made social comment on the world around him. In other words, he was not afraid to show "real life" in a way that was not always beautiful and nice.

Courbet's paintings were an inspiration to many other painters, particularly the French Impressionists and Post-Impressionists. Edouard Manet, Edgar Degas, Vincent van Gogh and Henri Toulouse-Lautrec were all inspired by Gustave Courbet's paintings of people. His landscape paintings were an inspiration to Claude Monet, Seurat, Cezanne and many other painters.

[[Possession Island, Queensland]]

CATEGORIES: Queensland, English explorers

Possession Island is a small island in the Torres Strait, near Cape York in far northern Queensland, Australia.

The island is called Bedanug or Bedhan Lag by the indigenous Australian people, the Kaurareg people. During his first voyage of discovery James Cook sailed north along the east coast of Australia, landing at Botany Bay. Reaching the tip of Queensland, he named and landed on Possession Island, just before sunset on Wednesday 22 August 1770. He said that the east coast was now British territory under the control of King George III.

He wrote in his journal:

In 2001, the Kaurareg successfully claimed native title rights over the island (and other nearby islands).

Possession Island is located at the centre of the Possession Island National Park. This park has an area of 5.10 km², and was made a protected area in 1977. It is looked after by the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service.

CATEGORIES: 1998 books, English-language novels, 20th century American novels, Children's books, Newbery Medal winning books, Texas in fiction, Young adult novels

Holes is a novel written by Louis Sachar. It was published on August 20, 1998 by Farrar, Straus and Giroux, with cover art by Vladimir Radunsky. It won the Newbery Medal in 1999.

The novel is about Stanley Yelnats, a 15-year old boy who is sent by mistake to a camp for young criminals. At the camp, boys must dig holes in the ground in the middle of a hot desert. Stanley starts to think the camp's warden is looking for something. This story is told alongside two others stories: one about Stanley's great-great-grandfather, and another about the area where the camp is located.

In 2003, Disney released a movie which was based on this novel, which was directed by Andrew Davis and written by the author of Holes himself, Louis Sachar. In 2006, Sachar also published a companion novel called Small Steps, which is about one of the characters from Holes.

[[Dietitian]]

CATEGORIES: Nutrition, Healthcare occupations

A dietitian or dietician is an expert in food and nutrition.

Dietitians help promote good health through proper eating. They often write custom diets for people.

In a medical setting they can give food supplements for those people who cannot get what they need because of swallowing problems.

Dietitians want to find, cook and serve tasty, attractive and healthy food to patients, their families and healthcare providers.

In many countries only people with specific degrees or certifications can call themselves dietitians. 

The term nutritionist is widely used as it is not controlled like the title dietitian, but the word nutritionist can be used without having the qualifications of registered dietitians.

A nutritionist is not a dietitian as he is not registered to a national board and does not have the same qualifications.

Dietitians are important in the medical multidisciplinary team because they are experts in nutrition and can give advice to doctors, nurses, and other health care workers.

Dietitians supervise the preparation and service of food, help in research, and teach people on how to eat well.

[[Mycology]]

CATEGORIES: Fungi

Mycology is the study of fungi. This includes their genetics, their biochemical properties (the chemical processes in them), their classification, their use to humans and their dangers (poisonous or infectious). Fungi are a source of tinder (easily combustible material to light fires), medicines, food, and  psychoactive substances. 

A biologist who studies mycology is called a mycologist. 

Mycology is closely related to phytopathology (the study of plant diseases), because most plant diseases are caused by fungi. 

Historically, mycology was a branch of botany (plant biology). Now fungi are thought to be more closely related to animals than to plants.

Fungi are fundamental (perhaps essential) for life on Earth. They are symbionts. They can break down complex organic biomolecules, and so they are a link in the global carbon cycle.

[[Webster-Hayne debate]]

CATEGORIES: 1830 in the United States

The Webster-Hayne debate was a famous debate in the United States between Senator Daniel Webster of Massachusetts and Senator Robert Y. Hayne of South Carolina. It happened on January 19-27, 1830. It was about protectionist tariffs.  The speeches between Webster and Hayne themselves were not planned. They had burst forth from arguments about a decision by Connecticut Senator Samuel Foote. Foote had temporarily stopped land surveying until land already on the market was sold. Webster's "Second Reply to Hayne" (1830) was widely seen as "the most eloquent speech ever delivered in Congress."

Webster described the US government as "made for the people, made by the people, and answerable to the people". This influenced Abraham Lincoln later. He spoke the words "government of the people, by the people, for the people" in his Gettysburg Address.

[[Human penis size]]

CATEGORIES: Male reproductive system, Human sexuality

Human penis size is talked or write by length and circumference of penis. It is larger than in any other primate. 

The size depends on arousal level, time of day, room temperature, frequency of sexual activity, and differences of the measurement methods. In many studies penis length is measured along the upper side, from the base to the tip with the man standing and the penis held parallel to the floor. The circumference is measured on erect penis: just below the glans penis, in the middle of the shaft, and at the base. Self-measurements report a higher average length than those which used medical or scientific methods. In some studies measuring the length of stretched soft penis is used to estimate erect penis length. Soft penis length is not a reliable indication of erect length. 

The average human erect penis is about 12.9 in length, the circumference is about 12.3. There is no scientific relation between either penis size or race, and shoe size or stretched penis size. At birth the penis is between 2.4, at the beginning of puberty, it is 6 cm. Penis size does not change much during adulthood.

CATEGORIES: Beans, Fabaceae

The chickpea (Cicer arietinum)  is a yellow edible legume (bean). It can be used for cooking. The peas can be bought canned or dried. It was one of the earliest fruits to be grown. The first chickpea was grown in the Middle East about 7,500 years ago. 

The most popular place for chickpeas to grow is in Pakistan. In 2008, nearly 6 million tonnes of chickpeas were produced there. Because the growth is so popular there, it is also known as the Indian pea. 

Chickpeas contain a great deal of protein, zinc and folic acid. They can be an important part of a vegetarian or vegan diet, since they come from a plant. 

The dried bean is boiled and served whole or mashed, such as in the popular dish hummus. Chickpeas are ground into a flour, called "besan" or "gram" flour, used in South Asian cooking.

[[Vetus Latina]]

CATEGORIES: Latin language, Bible versions

Vetus Latina is the name given to a collection of Biblical texts that were translated into Latin before the Vulgate became the standard version used in the Latin-speaking world. The texts themselves are written in Late Latin, not in Old Latin. They often use different words than the Vulgate. No complete manuscript survives,  only fragments are known. Many text passages are known because Church fathers such as Augustine of Hippo cited from them. 

Since the Council of Trent, held in the 16th century, the Vulgate is the official Bible translation for the Roman Catholic Church. 

Some of the Vetus Latin texts survives in the Liturgy, however:

The Old Latin text means, "Glory belongs to God among the high, and peace belongs to men of good will on earth". The Vulgate text means "Glory belongs to God among the most high and peace among men of good will on earth".

Probably the best known difference between the Old Latin and the Vulgate is in the Pater Noster, where the phrase from the Vetus Latina, quotidianum panem, "daily bread", becomes supersubstantialem panem, "supersubstantial bread" in the Vulgate.

[[J. C. Bailey]]

Joseph Carl Bailey, Jr. (August 23, 1983 – August 30, 2010) was an American professional wrestler. He was better known as J. C. Bailey. He has wrestled for numerous American-based professional wrestling promotions, including Combat Zone Wrestling (CZW), IWA Mid-South and IWA East Coast. He has been known as a hardcore wrestler.

Bailey made his debut in 2001. In June 2003, along with the owner of the promotion IWA Mid-South Ian Rotten and Corporal Robinson, he "invaded" CZW on behalf of IWA Mid-South. In the same year, he competed in the 2nd CZW Tournament of Death where he lost to Nick Mondo in a deathmatch involving light tubes, and the 5th IWA Mid-South King of the Deathmatch where he lost to Mad Man Pondo after defeating 2 Tuff Tony, Necro Butcher and Ian Rotten.

In 2004, he competed in the 3rd CZW Tournament of Death where he lost to Wifebeater after defeating Chri$ Ca$h, and the 6th IWA Mid-South King of the Deathmatch where he lost to Mad Man Pondo and Toby Klein.

Since then, he competed in many deathmatch tournaments including the 4th CZW Tournament of Death, 7th IWA Mid-South King of the Deathmatch, 8th IWA Mid-South King of the Deathmatch, 5th CZW Tournament of Death and 6.5th CZW Tournament of Death titled "Fast Forward".

On December 11, 2004, he teamed with Chri$ Ca$h, Nate Webb and Sexxxy Eddy, winning the CZW World Tag Team Championship.

On February 5, 2005, he became the first-ever CZW Ultraviolent Underground Champion. On August 13, 2005, he won his second CZW Ultraviolent Underground Championship.

On August 20, 2006, he went to Japan and competed in the professional wrestling tournament WRESTLE EXPO 2006 where he lost to 2 Tuff Tony after defeating Mad Man Pondo. On September 16, 2006, he competed in the 1st IWA East Coast Masters of Pain where he lost to Jun Kasai after defeating 2 Tuff Tony and Corporal Robinson.

In 2007, Bailey was arrested for stealing a television set from a Bardstown, Kentucky Walmart. He made his official return to CZW in early 2010.

On August 30, 2010, Bailey was found dead. He died in his sleep. Before he died, Bailey complained that he had been getting headaches and numbness in his hands. The cause of his death was later determined to be because of a brain aneurysm that was caused by complications from multiple concussions and traumas to his brain. His brain is expected to be donated for research at Boston University.

[[Historical rankings of presidents of the United States]]

CATEGORIES: Presidents of the United States, History of the United States

Historians (and sometimes political scientists) are surveyed and asked to give Presidents of the United States number ratings on their overall performance or on different aspects of their leadership.

Several different factors are considered in deciding what makes one a good or bad president.  These include their character, their vision for the country, their relations with congress, their relations with foreign leaders (diplomacy), how they managed the economy, how they managed the military, and their overall political skill.

To make sure the rankings are fair, many surveys equally balance the opinions of Democrats and Republicans.

It is sometimes difficult to accurately rank a president because all of the presidents faced completely different challenges and lived in different times.

Historical opinions of U.S. presidents may change over time. For example, Harry Truman had very low approval ratings right after he left office, but many historians now consider him among the greatest presidents.

[[Reconstruction era]]

CATEGORIES: African-American history, American Civil War, 1860s in the United States, 1870s in the United States, Andrew Johnson, Rutherford B. Hayes

The Reconstruction  was after the American Civil War. It was the remaking of the Southern United States, after it had lost its war of rebellion and slavery was ended. The southern states were occupied territory. Andrew Johnson became President of the U.S. after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln in 1865. He wanted to make it easy to restore local rule in the previously rebellious states, and he permitted some of them to hold elections in 1865. Former leaders of the Confederate States of America who ran as Democrats were elected to Congress, and states passed laws that denied rights to former slaves.

Many members of the Republican Party wanted stricter terms before local rule was returned to the South. After the Republicans won a large majority of the Congressional seats in the 1866 elections, they refused to let former Confederate leaders take seats in the United States Congress. The Republicans passed laws that former leaders of the rebellion were temporarily denied suffrage, the right to hold office or vote in elections. Three new amendments to the U.S. Constitution were passed that ended slavery, made former slaves citizens, and gave them the right to vote. Some newly freed black slaves won elected offices. Many Northern carpetbaggers also went to the occupied territories to lead the people. Some became rich.

Many white people in the Southern United States resisted allowing former slaves to have equal rights and to vote. The Ku Klux Klan was formed to force black people out of political and economic power. After Reconstruction ended in 1877, white people in the South used their regained political rights to pass Jim Crow Laws. These laws enforced segregation (keeping blacks and whites separate) and took the vote away from African Americans whose parents or grandparents were slaves. After Reconstruction, white Southerners voted mostly for the Democratic Party for about 80 years.

[[Troodontidae]]

CATEGORIES: Theropods

Troodontidae is a family of bird-like theropod dinosaurs. They were found mainly in Mongolia, China and North America. The first specimen, just a single tooth, was found in central Montana in 1855 by Ferdinand Hayden.

For a long time, troodontid fossils were few and scrappy.  Recently more complete specimens have been found. There are now complete and articulated specimens, including  feathers, eggs and embryos, and complete juveniles. In 1994 a fossil of an adult Troodon was found sitting on a nest with eight eggs.

Anatomical studies of the most primitive troodontids, like Sinovenator, demonstrate striking similarities with Archaeopteryx and primitive dromaeosaurids. This proves they are relatives: they are a clade called Paraves. 

The family have relatively large brains, a skull with many air pockets, a retractable second toe claw (it could be pulled in) and many teeth. The number of teeth ranges from 96 in Saurornithoides mongoliensis to 120 in the Troodon.

[[Sinovenator]]

CATEGORIES: Dinosaurs of Asia, Cretaceous dinosaurs, Theropods

Sinovenator is a small troodontid dinosaur, about the size of a chicken. It is from the early Cretaceous period, 128.2 million years ago. Two fossils were  found in the older (lower) portion of the Yixian Formation in China. It was part of the Jehol biota.

The type specimen of Sinovenator changii was described in 2002. The specimen is a partial skull and disarticulated skeleton. A second specimen has connected bones, but lacks the skull. Both are in the collection of the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology in Beijing, China. 

Sinovenator was a basal troodontid. It shares features with the most primitive dromaeosaurids and Avialae. This shows the common descent of these three members of the Paraves. 

[[Paraves]]

CATEGORIES: Coelurosaurs, Birds, Fossils

Paraves is a branch-based clade containing birds (clade Aves) and other closely related dinosaurs. The paravians include the Avialae, such as Archaeopteryx, and the Deinonychosauria, which includes the dromaeosaurids and troodontids.

The name Paraves was coined by Paul Sereno in 1997. The clade was defined by Sereno in 1998 as a branch-based clade containing all Maniraptora closer to modern birds than to Oviraptor.

The work of Xu and colleagues provide examples of basal and early paravians with four wings, including members of the Avialae (Pedopenna), Dromaeosauridae (Microraptor), and Troodontidae (Anchiornis).

[[Stan (dinosaur)]]

CATEGORIES: Cretaceous dinosaurs

Stan is the nickname given to a fossil of the dinosaur species Tyrannosaurus rex. It was found in Hell Creek Formation, South Dakota, close to Buffalo in 1987 by Stan Sacrison, who also discovered the Tyrannosaurus specimen nicknamed "Duffy". The original specimen is housed at the Black Hills Institute of Geological Research. 

It is a well known specimen, and one of the most complete, with 199 bones recovered. About 30 casts of the original fossil has been sold worldwide, each for a price of about $100 000. Stan measures 10.9 metres long.

[[Treponema pallidum]]

CATEGORIES: Gram-negative bacteria

Treponema pallidum is a parasitic spirochaete bacterium.  There are different kinds of Treponema pallidum, which cause diseases like syphilis, bejel, pinta and yaws.

The most common disease caused by Treponema pallidum is syphilis, a serious sexually transmitted infection.  

Syphilis is treated and cured by taking antibiotics. Usually, the first treatment used is penicillin. Antibiotic resistance has developed to a number of agents. Ceftriaxone, a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic, may be as effective as penicillin-based treatment.

Pennicilin is still effective, but "the potential of this spirochete to develop additional antibiotic resistance could seriously compromise syphilis treatment and control".

CATEGORIES: Ancient Greece, Ancient Greek marble sculptures, British Museum, Ancient Greek and Roman statues

The Parthenon Marbles, sometimes called the Elgin Marbles, are a series of ancient Greek sculptures of relief  made from marble. They were originally part of the Parthenon temple in Athens but they were taken by Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin in the early 1800s. 

Many people, including the Greek government, have argued that Elgin stole the marbles and did not take them legally.  They are on display in the British Museum.  The Greek government asked to have them back many times.  In 2014 UNESCO offered to mediate but the museum declined.

[[Ant mill]]

CATEGORIES: Ants

An ant mill is a small group of army ants away from the other ants.  They lose the pheromone track and begin to follow each other, making a spinning circle.  The ants will die of exhaustion.  People can make this happen easily.  This is a side effect of the self organizing structure of ant colonies. Each ant only knows to follow the ant in front of it. This will work until something goes wrong and an ant mill forms.  An ant mill was first seen by William Beebe who saw a mill 1,200 feet in circumference.  It took each ant 2.5 hours to go around.

Neoclassicism is the name given to movements in the arts that draw upon Western classical art and culture (usually that of Ancient Greece or Ancient Rome). Traditionally, Classicism is about the art made in antiquity (very long ago, in ancient times) or later art inspired by that of antiquity. But Neoclassicism is always about the art made later but inspired by antiquity. So, Classicism and Neoclassicism are often used together. It often means clearness, elegance, harmony, and rest made by careful attention to traditional forms.

Examples of Neoclassicism in architecture include the White House and Neue Wache.

Robert Todd Lincoln (August 1, 1843 – July 26, 1926) was an American lawyer and Secretary of War. He was the first son of President Abraham Lincoln and his wife, Mary Todd Lincoln. Born in Springfield, Illinois, United States, he was the only one of Lincoln's four sons to live to be an adult. He was a bright lawyer, and mostly served railroad interests. He was (1897–1911) president of the Pullman Company. He was quiet and shy. Because of this, he never tried to be a president, but he was minister to Great Britain (1889–93). Most of his last 20 years were spent at Hildene, his estate near Manchester, Vermont.

Lincoln did not have a very close relationship with his father. This was partly because Abraham Lincoln often spent months away from home. Robert would later say his clearest memory of his father was when he was packing for a trip to Illinois. Abraham Lincoln was proud of Robert. He thought Robert was clever. Though they were not close, Robert respected and loved his father. He wept openly at his deathbed.

Following his father's assassination, in April 1865, Robert Lincoln moved with his mother and his brother Tad to Chicago, where Robert completed his law studies at the Old University of Chicago (a school different from but later assumed by the university presently known by that name). He was admitted to the bar on February 25, 1867.

Lincoln was also present during the assassinations of James A. Garfield and William McKinley. He is the only man to have been present in the area where three US Presidents were assassinated.

On September 24, 1868, Robert Lincoln married Mary Eunice Harlan (September 25, 1846 – March 31, 1937). They had two daughters and one son. The last person who was directly related to Lincoln was Robert's grandson "Bud" Beckwith. He died in 1985.

[[Sejanus]]

CATEGORIES: Roman people

Sejanus (Lucius Aelius Seianus 20 BC – October 18, AD 31), was an ambitious soldier, friend and confidant of the Roman Emperor Tiberius. An equestrian by birth, Sejanus rose to power as Praetorian Prefect. He commanded the Roman imperial bodyguard, the Praetorian Guard, from AD 14 until his death in 31.

After the Praetorian Guard was established under Augustus, Sejanus introduced reforms which saw the unit go from a mere bodyguard to an influential branch of the government. It controlled public security, and influenced civil administration. Most important of all, it influenced the succession of emperors: all needed the goodwill and support of the Guard. These changes would have a lasting impact on the Empire.

During the 20s, Sejanus gradually accumulated power by influencing Tiberius and eliminating potential political opponents, including the emperor's son, Drusus. When Tiberius withdrew to Capri in 26, Sejanus was left in control of the entire state mechanism as de facto ruler of the empire. For a time the most influential and feared citizen of Rome, Sejanus suddenly fell from power in 31, the year his career culminated with the consulship. Amidst suspicions of conspiracy against Tiberius, Sejanus was arrested and executed, along with his followers.

[[Al Jolson]]

CATEGORIES: 1886 births, 1950 deaths, American movie actors, Singers from Washington, D.C., Actors from Washington, D.C., Jewish American actors

Al Jolson (May 26, 1886 – October 23, 1950) was a Lithuanian - American singer and actor.  His career lasted from 1911 until his death in 1950. He was called "the world's greatest entertainer”. 

His singing style was "sentimental and melodramatic".  This style made many songs popular. Jolson influenced many famous singers.  Some of these singers were Bing Crosby Judy Garland, rock and country entertainer Jerry Lee Lewis, and Bob Dylan.  Dylan said Jolson was "somebody whose life I can feel".

Jolson was America's most famous and highest paid entertainer in the 1930s.  Jolson sang and acted in the first (full length) talking movie, The Jazz Singer in 1927. He starred in many other musical movies in the 1930s.  A movie about Jolson's life, The Jolson Story, won Oscars in 1946. Larry Parks played Jolson, but Jolson sang the songs himself. A sequel, Jolson Sings Again, was released in 1949, and was nominated for three Oscars. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, Jolson became the first star to entertain troops overseas during World War II.  Again in 1950 became the first star to perform for GIs in Korea.  He did 42 shows in 16 days.

He sometimes performed in blackface makeup.  This was a theatrical convention in the mid-19th century. With his unique and dynamic style of singing black music, like jazz and blues, he was later credited with single-handedly introducing African-American music to white audiences. As early as 1911 he became known for fighting against anti-black discrimination on Broadway. Jolson's well-known theatrics and his promotion of equality on Broadway helped pave the way for many black performers, playwrights, and songwriters, including Cab Calloway, Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Fats Waller, and Ethel Waters.

Zhytomyr (Житомир) is a city in Ukraine, the administrative center of Zhytomyr Oblast. Nearly 271 000 people live here (2009).

Zhytomyr is a big transportation center. The city lies on a historic way that connects the city of Kiev with the west through Brest. Today it connects Warsaw with Kiev, Minsk with Izmail, and several major cities of Ukraine. Zhytomyr was also the location of Ozerne, an important Cold War strategic plane base that was situated 11 southeast of the city.

Zhytomyr is divided into two districts. It is located on the Teteriv River.

As a legend says, Zhytomyr was founded about 884 by Zhytomyr, prince of a Slavic tribe of Drevlians. This date, 884, is cut in the large stone of the ice age times, that stands on the hill where it was founded.

[[Media center]]

The term media center refers either to a dedicated computer appliance or to a specialized application software designed to run on standard personal computer hardware which then becomes a so called "HTPC" ("Home Theater PC", also sometimes referred to as a "Media PC"), both of which are adapted for playing various kinds of media (music, movies, photos etc.). A media center usually has a GUI (Graphical User Interface) designed to be used with a living-room TV using a remote control. This remote control is commonly known by their designers as a 10-foot user interface. A media center typically allows one to watch movies (DVD, Blu-ray, and other digital video formats) and watching and recording television broadcasts, playing audio (CD as well as MP3, WMA, and other audio formats).

The media itself may be stored, received by terrestrial, satellite or cable broadcasting or streamed from the internet. Stored media is kept either on a local hard drive or on a (wireless) network attached storage. Some software is capable of doing other tasks, such as finding news (RSS) from the Internet. Media centers are often operated with a remote control, connected to a television set for video output, and can sometimes function as a normal personal computer.

A media center can be purpose-built, modified or created individuals by adding media center software to a PC or some other computer, for example a Home Theater PC or an Xbox. Lately, some video game consoles (such as PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360) with their network services can also act as a basic media center device by default.

[[Doctor-patient relationship]]

CATEGORIES: Medicine, Relationships

The relationship between a doctor and a patient is a very important part of medicine. Only when there is a good relationship between the two is it possible to have high-quality healthcare. This relationship is also at the base of medical ethics. Many medical schools teach the doctors to be to keep a professional relationship with their patients, to respect the patients' dignity and privacy. 

This relationship has asymmetric information though. The doctor knows more than the patient, but has to explain the patient's situation, and has to ask the patient what treatments should be done. There is a very similar relationship between the patient and nurses, psychologists.

There are different legal norms that regulate this relationship. Examples of such norms are the Hippocratic oath, the Declaration of Geneva. Professional responsibility may also govern such a relationship.

Ideally, patient and doctor trust each other. If they do, this can have a positive influence on the development of disease or condition. Healing can be hindered if the patient does not take the prescribed drugs, of if these drugs are not taken in the doses prescribed.

If the relationship is too good this can preclude efficiency. In certain cases, it may be good to get the opinion of a second doctor, regarding a condition.

[[Corm]]

CATEGORIES: Botany

A corm is a modified plant stem some plants use as a storage organ or for hibernation.  Corms are structurally plant stems, and can produce roots. On the top of the corm, one or a few buds grow into shoots that produce normal leaves and flowers.

Some plants with corms regularly replace their older corms with a stack of younger ones. In other species their corms simply grow larger in most seasons. Yet others split when multiple buds or stolons on a large corm sprout independently.

Corms can be dug up and used to multiply or redistribute the plant (see, for example, taro). Plants with corms generally can be propagated by cutting the corms into sections and replanting. 

[[Army ant]]

CATEGORIES: Ants

Army ant (or legionary ant or "Marabunta") means over 200 ant species. They are called army ants due to their aggressive predatory groups looking for food, known as "raids", in which many ants look for food at the same time in one place, attacking other animals en masse.

Most ant species make homes where they always live.  Army ants do not.  They keep moving. All army ant species are part of the ant family, Formicidae. There are several kinds that have evolved on their own the same behavior. This is called "legionary behavior", and is convergent evolution.

CATEGORIES: Irrational numbers

In mathematics, an irrational number is a real number that cannot be written as a complete ratio of two integers. 

Irrational numbers often occur in geometry. For instance, if a square has sides of 1 meter, the distance between opposite corners is the square root of two meters. This is an irrational number. In decimal form it is written as 1.414213... Mathematicians have proved that the square root of every natural number is either an integer or an irrational number.

One well known irrational number is pi (π). This is the circumference of a circle divided by its diameter. This number is the same for every circle. The number pi is approximately 3.14159265358979323… .

The Oxfordshire Ironstone Railway (the O.I.R.) was a standard gauge railway that served an ironstone quarry near the village of Wroxton in Oxfordshire. It linked to the Great Western Railway about 6 to the east, just north of the town of Banbury. Both the quarry and line opened in 1917 and closed in 1967, when the Ironstone ran out. It never became part of British Rail and was run by the quarry's owners.

The quarry was heavily worked in the Second World War, due to extra war needs. A newer quarry close by is now served by trucks only.

The OIR operated its own fleet of steam locomotives: 0-6-0T, 0-6-0ST and 0-4-0ST's.

CATEGORIES: 1941 births, Living people, Presidents of South Korea, Mayors of Seoul, People from Osaka

Lee Myung-bak (ˌliː ˌmjɜŋˈbak) 이명박; born 19 December 1941) was President of South Korea from 2008 to 2013. He was the CEO of Hyundai Engineering and Construction. In 2002 Lee declared his candidacy for Seoul Mayor, and won the election. After he became president, he said, "I will give Seoul a complete makeover."  He was elected the President of South Korea on 19 December 2007. This was the same day as his birthday. It was also the same day he married his wife, Kim Yoon-ok. So, on their 37th wedding anniversary and his 67th birthday, Lee became President of South Korea. He finished his service in February 2013. Lee has three daughters and one son.

Lee Myung-bak was born on December 19, 1941 in Japan. After the end of World War II in 1945, his family came back to his father's hometown Pohang, Gyeongsangbuk-do, South Korea. Lee went to night school at Dongji Commercial High School.

On March 26, 2010 an explosion destroyed the South Korean warship Cheonan. This killed 40 men. Six men also disappeared. They are thought to be dead. An investigation into the sinking blamed North Korea. They said that a torpedo fired by a North Korean submarine had sunk the ship. North Korea said it had nothing to do with the Cheonan's sinking. They said they were not guilty. Lee said their denial was "laughable". He stopped all trade between the north and south. He also asked the United Nations to help them against North Korea. He also began sending radio messages to North Korean people.

Lee Myung-bak is a Christian and goes to the Somang Presbyterian church. When he was a mayor, he once declared that Seoul was a "holy place governed by God". He has been much criticized for his beliefs. Buddhist people protested that Lee was a threat to their religion.

Lee has also been criticized for not giving enough political freedom to the people. For example, the police limited demonstrations. But Lee said, "I fully understand the protestors' point of view on the matter". He added, "Protesting culture has a deep root in democracy of Korea and despite the ongoing political upheaval of this country, the enthusiasm that the protesters showed is one side ... we embrace (approve) and this will ... be a positive (good) drive of Korea's development."

[[Phonon]]

CATEGORIES: Physics

In physics, a phonon is a quantized lattice vibration.  The word quantized is used in physics to mean that only certain values of something are allowed.  Something that is quantized can be thought of as stairs; you can only move from step to step and you can't stand in between steps.  Something that is not quantized can be thought of as a ramp or smooth incline; you can move any distance up or down.  A lattice is the repeating or periodic structure of a crystal.  A crystal is made up of atoms or molecules in a certain pattern.  The points on the pattern at which the atoms or molecules are located is the lattice.  Solids, liquids, and gases can all experience vibrations.  A vibration being quantized means that only certain frequencies of vibrations are allowed.

Intuitively, there is no reason for lattice vibrations to be quantized.  The macroscopic or large-scale vibrations of a material are not quantized and can take on essentially any frequency.  It is only when we consider the tiny vibrations of the particles that make up a material—atoms and molecules—that the concept of quantization and phonons becomes important.  To understand why phonons exist, complicated quantum mechanics is needed.  Without going into too much detail, the interactions between the constituent atoms or molecules of a crystal are analyzed quantum mechanically.  Because of their arrangement in a pattern that repeats, when one arrives at a mathematical expression for the frequency of oscillation, one finds that there are only distinct quantized values allowed.  There is unfortunately no simple way to explain this.

[[ELIZA]]

CATEGORIES: Software

ELIZA is an early program able to process natural language. ELIZA operated by processing users' responses to scripts. The most famous script was called DOCTOR. It was a simulation of a Rogerian psychotherapist. Eliza didn't know much about thought or emotion. However, DOCTOR   sometimes provided conversation like a human. ELIZA was written at MIT by Joseph Weizenbaum between 1964 to 1966.

When the person used words that were not in the very small list,

DOCTOR might say, for example, responding to "My head hurts", "Why do you say your head hurts?" The response to "My mother hates me" might be "Who else in your family hates you?" ELIZA was programmed using simple pattern matching techniques, but was taken seriously by several of its users, even after Weizenbaum explained to them how it worked. It was one of the first chatterbots in existence.

[[GNU Emacs]]

CATEGORIES: Free software, Microsoft Windows software, Linux software

GNU Emacs (short for Editing Macros) is a text editor that is common on many UNIX-based operating systems.

Emacs is primarily used by programmers.

Emacs is made powerful by Emacs Lisp, a built-in programming language that lets the user extend the capabilities of the editor.

A common Emacs joke is that all of the functions of the editor are crazy weird keystrokes (such as "control-meta-4 shift-left-P-semicolon-F1" to do something simple like cut and paste text).  In reality, though, these keystrokes are relatively simple, though they can take some getting used to.

There is an Internet turf war between programmers that prefer Emacs and programmers that prefer Vim (or Vi), another common text editor.

[[Goto]]

CATEGORIES: Computer programming

goto is a statement in many programming languages. It is a combination of the English words go and to. It is a way to jump to another line of code.

Many languages support the goto statement, and many do not. In Java, goto is a reserved word, but cannot be used. (A reserved word is a word that is a part of the programming language and cannot be used for other things like naming variables.)

In Computer Science, there is a theory called the structured program theorem. This theory says that any program can be written in such a way that things are done with functions and methods (smaller sub-programs) instead of in one very big program and goto statements. The theory proves that the goto statement is not needed to write programs.

It "set a new high record for the sale of a document at public auction". The Castro government claimed Cintas' properties after it became powerful in 1959. But Cintas, who died in 1957, had willed the Gettysburg Address to the American people, if it would be kept at the White House. It was moved there in 1959, and is still there today.

[[Hyperopia]]

CATEGORIES: Diseases and disorders of the eye

Hyperopia (also called hypermetropia or far-sightedness) is a problem with the focusing ability of the eye. People with hyperopia have an easier time seeing things that are far away than seeing things that are up close. Inside the eye is the lens which can change shape to change the focusing power of the eye and make things look clear. Someone who is not far-sighted only needs to use their lens to make far objects look clear. But for someone with hyperopia, their lens has to do that even when they're looking far away, and it has to work extra hard to make close objects look clear. 

Many people with small amounts of hyperopia don't have any problems seeing up close because it's easy for their lens to focus all the time, especially when they're children. But if they have more hyperopia, they often get headaches and eyestrain when they read for a long time because the muscle that controls the lens gets tired.

Hyperopia can be corrected with glasses, contact lenses, or surgery.

[[Dispersion]]

CATEGORIES: Physics

Dispersion is the idea that the frequency of a wave influences its velocity (speed).  Dispersion is most easily seen in light, when all the colors inside white light become separated by a prism. 

When a white beam is shone at the prism, all of the colors in the light (colour spectrum) are slowed down when they meet the prism.  Each color then refracts (bends) at different angles, making us see a rainbow.

The spitting of white light into seven colours (VIBGYOR) is dispersion

[[Absorption spectroscopy]]

CATEGORIES: Spectroscopy

Absorption spectroscopy is a technique used to find out what makes up a sample of a substance – in other words, a chemical analysis.

When a full spectrum of light (light with all the colours, like light from the sun) passes through the sample (which is often a gas) some specific colours do not show up on the other side. These colours of light are being absorbed by the sample. An image is created of the spectrum of light with black breaks where the light has been absorbed. These breaks are called absorption lines, and every element has its characteristic pattern of absorption lines.

On an atomic scale, this happens because of the electrons in the atoms of the sample - an electron can absorb light to gain energy. From experiments, electrons only ever absorb certain amounts of energy, suggesting an electron's energy must fit onto set, quantised, discrete energy levels. The process of an electron going to a higher energy level is called excitation. For any atom of a particular element, the energy needed to excite an electron from one specific energy level to another will be the same. This is important because it allows us to compare the absorption lines of say, the atmosphere of a far away planet, to the absorption lines of elements we know to exist in a lab. We can then reach a conclusion about what the distant planet's atmosphere may be made of.

The missing colours give us information about the energy of the photons that cause excitation. Note that the energy gained by the excited electron is equal to the energy of the incident photon (a particle of light), so only photons with fitting energies will cause an excitation. The energy of a photon is proportional to its frequency: 

Where E is the energy of a photon, h is Planck's constant (a constant is a set number that doesn't change) and f is the frequency of the photon. Since a colour can be described as a specific frequency of light, this is why the black breaks can be used to identify element(s) which the light is passing through.

The intensity of the absorption varies as a function of frequency, and this variation is the absorption spectrum.

In chemistry, the technique is used to detect and measure concentrations of a particular metal element within a solution. The  scientists atomise the sample (make it turn to individual atoms) and then see what light wavelengths it absorbs. Each type of chemical (element) absorbs a particular wavelength, so scientists can tell which chemicals are in the sample. Every element has a different atomic absorption spectrum because of the different light wavelengths it absorbs.

He is most famous for inventing Occam's razor. He wrote about logic, epistemology, natural philosophy, political philosophy, metaphysics and ethics. 

William of Ockham went to school at the University of Oxford, where he studied theology. After he graduated, he became a teacher of philosophy at the school. However, the Church did not like the ideas he was teaching, and brought him to court on charges of heresy in 1327. Because he was afraid he would be executed, William of Ockham fled the school and spent the rest of his life living with a group of friars who also did not like the large power that the Church had.

Her parents are Cygnus Black III and Druella Black (née Rosier) and the eldest of three sisters: Bellatrix, Andromeda and Narcissa. She is an enthusiastic Death Eater who believes that Lord Voldemort is the supreme and everyone should follow him. She marries Rodolphus Lestrange, but it was Voldemort that she truly loved. In the Harry Potter movies she was played by Helena Bonham Carter. She has been to Azkaban, the wizard prison, but Lord Voldemort helped her and the other Death Eaters in Azkaban escape. She is killed by Molly Weasley at the end of book 7 when she attempts to kill Ginny Weasley with the killing curse Avada Kedavra.

[[Snowy River]]

CATEGORIES: Rivers of Victoria (Australia), Rivers of New South Wales

The Snowy River is a major river in south-eastern Australia. It starts on the slopes of Mount Kosciuszko,  Australia's highest mountain. It gets its water from the eastern slopes of the Snowy Mountains in New South Wales,  and then flows through the Snowy River  National Park in Victoria and finally into Bass Strait. Up until the middle of the 20th  century, the river was known for the large amount of fresh water it carried, its wide reach and large rapids.  

The river's course and surroundings have not changed very much, as it is protected by the Snowy River  National Park. However its flow of water was almost stopped in the 1950's by the building of the Snowy Mountains Scheme to make hydroelectricity. Four large dams were built, at Guthega, Island Bend, Eucumbene, and  Jindabyne, as well as many smaller dams and tunnels. Less than 1% of the river flow, as measured at Jindabyne, New South Wales, continued to flow down the river. Concern over the health of river led to an agreement between the state and federal governments to increase the amount of water released back into the river. From 2002 to 2008 the flow was increased from 1% to 4%. The agreement planned to increase the flow to 15% by 2009 and 21% by 2012.

[[Roundheads]]

CATEGORIES: 17th century in England

The Roundheads were a group of people who supported Parliament & Oliver Cromwell during the English Civil War. They were also called 'Parliamentarians'. They fought against Charles I and the Cavaliers otherwise known as 'Royalists'. The Parliamentary army put their soldiers in red coats. The British army continued using red in later centuries.

Some Puritans, but by no means all, wore their hair closely cropped round the head or flat and there was an obvious contrast between them and the men of fashion, who wore long ringlets. "Roundheads" appears to have been first used as a term of derision toward the end of 1641, when the debates in Parliament in the Clergy Act 1640 were causing riots at Westminster. According to John Rushworth the word was first used on 27 December 1641 by a disbanded officer named David Hide, who during a riot is reported to have drawn his sword and said he would "cut the throat of those round-headed dogs that bawled against bishops". A few decades later “Whigs” was the word for men of similar opinions.

[[Cavaliers]]

CATEGORIES: Minor phyla

The Nematomorpha (horsehair worms) are a phylum of parasitic cycloneuralian animals. They look similar to nematode worms and live in similar environments, which is why their names are similar. They are sometimes called Gordiacea.

They range in size from 50 long and in extreme cases may be up to 2 meters long. They are 1 in diameter. Horsehair worms can be discovered in damp areas such as watering troughs, streams, puddles, and cisterns. 

About 326 species are known and an estimate suggests that there may be about 2000 species worldwide. 

Fossilized worms have been reported from Lower Cretaceous Burmese amber 100–110 million years ago.

[[Burgess Shale]]

CATEGORIES: Lagerstätten, Mountains of British Columbia, Cambrian, Geological formations, Sedimentary rocks, World Heritage Sites in Canada

The Burgess Shale Formation in the Rocky Mountains of British Columbia is one of the world's most celebrated fossil fields, and the best of its kind. It is famous for the exceptional preservation of the soft parts of its fossils. It is ~505 million years old (Middle Cambrian), one of the earliest soft-parts fossil beds.

The rock unit is a black shale, and crops out at a number of localities near the town of Field in the Yoho National Park.

The Burgess Shale was discovered by palaeontologist Charles Doolittle Walcott in 1909, towards the end of the season's fieldwork. He returned in 1910 with his sons, and established a quarry on the flanks of Fossil Ridge. The fact that fossils were of soft-bodied forms, and the range of organisms new to science, led him to return to the quarry almost every year until 1924. At this point, aged 74, he had amassed over 65,000 specimens.

Describing the fossils is  a vast task, pursued by Walcott until his death in 1927, and continued into the 21st century.  Walcott, led by scientific opinion at the time, attempted to categorise all fossils into living taxa. As a result, the fossils were regarded as little more than curiosities at the time. It was not until 1962 that a first-hand reinvestigation of the fossils was attempted, by Alberto Simonetta. This led scientists to recognise that Walcott had barely scratched the surface of information available in the Burgess Shale.

A second quarry (in the same geological formation) was opened. A thorough reassessment of the Burgess Shale showed that the fauna were much more varied and unusual than Walcott had realised. The Royal Ontario Museum now has the largest collection of Burgess Shale material in the world with over 150,000 specimens. Many of the animals present had bizarre anatomical features and only the slightest resemblance to other known animals. Examples include Opabinia, with five eyes and a snout like a vacuum cleaner hose; Nectocaris, and Hallucigenia. This last was originally reconstructed upside down, walking on its spines.

The Burgess Shale was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1980. It became part of the Canada Rocky Mountain Parks World Heritage Site in 1984.

[[Solnhofen limestone]]

CATEGORIES: Bavaria, Fossils, Lagerstätten

The Solnhofen limestone is the world's most famous fossil site. It is a lagerstätte of Upper Jurassic limestone which has preserved many fossils in great detail. The specimens of Archaeopteryx are perhaps the world's most valuable fossils, because they are the earliest fossils of a bird capable of flight.

The Solnhofen beds lie in the German state of Bavaria (Bayern), halfway between Nuremberg (Nürnberg) and Munich (München). They were originally quarried as a source of roof and floor tiles, then for lithographic printing.

[[Aenictogiton]]

[[Underweight]]

CATEGORIES: Health problems

The term underweight refers to humans that have much less weight than they should. Being underweight is bad for the overall health of the person affected. It is normal what a person's weights changes over time. Being underweight is often defined using a measure called the body mass index which calculates a score, based on  height and weight. If this score is below 18.5, a person is generally said to be underweight. This is only a general indication, though as the scores must not be calculated for everyone. It does not apply to children and adolescents, for example.

Being underweight can have different causes:

[[Pot-in-pot refrigerator]]

CATEGORIES: Food and drink

The pot-in-pot refrigerator, also known as a Zeer الزير in Arabic, is a food cooling device. It works by using the evaporation of water. It needs no electricity.

It is made by putting a clay pot inside a larger clay pot with wet sand in between the pots and a wet cloth on top. As the water evaporates it cools the inside, letting food stored in the inner pot to be kept fresh for some time. It must be placed in a dry, ventilated place for the water to evaporate to the outside.

Evaporative coolers perform poorly or not at all in climates with high humidity.

Mohammed Bah Abba of Nigeria patented the device in 1995 and was awarded a Rolex prize in 2000 for developing the “pot-in-pot preservation/cooling system”. However, the device was known at least as early as the Middle Kingdom of Egypt, as seen by the hieroglyphic kbb, "to cool".

[[Jehol biota]]

CATEGORIES: Lagerstätten, Fossils, China, Geological formations

The Jehol biota  includes all the living organisms – the ecosystem – of northeastern China between 133 to 120 million years ago (mya). This is the Lower Cretaceous ecosystem which left fossils in the Yixian Formation, some 125–121 mya, and the Jiufotang Formation. It is also believed to have left fossils in the Sinuiju series of North Korea. 

The ecosystem in the Lower Cretaceous was dominated by wetlands and numerous lakes (not rivers, deltas, or marine habitats). Rainfall was seasonal, alternating between semi-arid, and mesic conditions. The climate was temperate. The Jehol ecosystem was interrupted at times by ash eruptions from volcanoes to the west. The word Jehol was the name given during the Japanese occupation of North-East China, 1933–1946.

The Jehol biota is noteworthy for the many different fossils and the large numbers of individuals of each species that have been recovered.

At first it just wanted to show anger at the draft. But the protests became violent and "a virtual racial pogrom, with uncounted numbers of blacks murdered on the streets". Major General John E. Wool said on July 16, "Martial law ought (should) to be proclaimed, but I have not a sufficient (enough) force to enforce it." The military stopped the mob using weapons. However, they had already destroyed many buildings, including homes and an orphanage for black children.

[[Digital rights]]

CATEGORIES: Computers, Rights

Digital rights are the rights of people regarding what they can do with their computer. There are many cases that need special thought related to digital rights, such as the right to have data accessible to a few people (privacy) and freedom of expression. Very often the word is used when referring to computer networks such as the Internet. 

In 2003, the United Nations held a special talk, called the World Summit on the Information Society. One of the tasks of this talk was to make the digital divide smaller. The digital divide separates countries into "rich" ones and "poor" ones. For "poor" countries accessing the internet is much more hard. After long talks, all people in the talk signed a closing statement.

The statement pointed out that human rights were universal, and that they could not be divided. They were also related to the basic freedoms that the Vienna Declaration had defined, and could not be separated from them. In addition,  democracy as well as sustainable development should be respected and the rule of law should be made stronger.

This declaration also makes specific reference to the importance of the right to freedom of expression in the "Information Society". It says:

"We reaffirm, as an essential foundation of the Information Society, and as outlined in Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, that everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; that this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers. Communication is a fundamental social process, a basic human need and the foundation of all social organization. It is central to the Information Society. Everyone, everywhere should have the opportunity to participate and no one should be excluded from the benefits of the Information Society offers."

Digital rights management is in this area, as an example.

[[Enigma machine]]

CATEGORIES: World War II, Cryptography

The Enigma machine was created for Germany by Arthur Scherbius in World War I. It is a cypher machine: a way of changing the letters of a message so that it appears to be scrambled letters (or, random letters).

Each time a letter is typed, it appears as another letter in the alphabet. The choices are not random. They are decided by a series of rotors which are set each day to a different starting set-up. Every press of a key turns the rotors to a new position.

German military messages done on the Enigma machine were first broken by the Polish Cipher Bureau, beginning in December 1932. Later, they designed mechanical devices for breaking Enigma cyphers. From 1938 more complexity was added to the Enigma machines, making decryption more difficult.

On 25 July 1939, in Warsaw, the Poles showed French and British intelligence agents their cryptanalysis of the Enigma, and promised each delegation a Polish-built Enigma. The demonstration was a vital start for the later British work at Bletchley Park.

During the invasion of Poland (1939) the Polish codebreakers were sent to France for safety. Later, they fled to Britain. Making technical improvements, British codebreakers solved a vast number of messages from Enigma, and gave the plaintext to military staff. The information got from this, called "Ultra" by the British, was a great help to the Allied war effort. Ultra also included decrypts of other German, Italian and Japanese cyphers and codes, including the cypher of the German High Command.

Mistakes by German operators helped the cryptanalysis of Luftwaffe Enigmas, and the British capture of key tables and a machine from a German submarine helped in cracking Navy ones.

On 15th July 2011, Queen Elizabeth II visited Bletchley Park, where the machine is kept in the Museum, to pay tribute to those who worked there, since they cut short the war by breaking the cyphers of Nazi Germany.

[[Northwest Passage]]

CATEGORIES: Exploration, Arctic

The Northwest Passage is a sea passage along the north coast of North America, through the Arctic Ocean. Because of ice, the passage is usually closed to ships. 

The Spanish Empire wanted to reach Asia by a western route, because Portugal controlled the eastern route around the Cape of Good Hope. Spain wanted to have a route that it could control. This caused most European countries to search for a possible route. Roald Amundsen was the first person to navigate the passage between 1903 and 1906.

Global warming is increasing the melting for the Passage.

[[Chatroulette]]

CATEGORIES: Websites

Chatroulette is a webcam chatting site founded by Andrei Ternowski in November 2009. Two people are randomly connected. At any time, one of the people can end the chat by pressing F9 on their keyboard. According to Robert J. Moore, the CEO and co-founder of RJMetrics, about 1 in 8 people are either naked or lewd.  Many people think children should not use it. Since December 2012, users can only use their webcam if they have had at least 3 conversations that lasted 10 minutes or longer. If a user didn't do that yet, their webcam will display a picture. Also, a person has to register before using it. If someone acts strange or offends another person, you can report him/her by  keyboard.

[[Mare Tranquillitatis]]

CATEGORIES: Surface features of the Moon

Mare Tranquillitatis is a large area on the visible side of the Moon.  It is also called the Sea of Tranquillity.  It is called a sea because ancient astronomers looked at the Moon and thought they saw seas and oceans on the Moon.  Now we know that they are not seas.  They are darkened areas on the Moon's surface.  They may have been made by ancient volcanoes by things such as leaks and eruptions.  Mare Tranquillitatis is just one of the 22 "Seas" and "Oceans" on the Moon.

[[Pterygota]]

CATEGORIES: Insects

Pterygota is a subclass of insects that includes the winged insects. It also includes insect orders that are secondarily wingless. That means insect groups whose ancestors once had wings but that have lost them later in evolution.

The Pterygota today includes almost all insects. That is because flying led to a great radiation of insect types. The groups without flight are in the Apterygota.

In the Pterygota, are the Palaeoptera and the Neoptera. The Palaeoptera is paraphyletic, and its classification is being discussed. Likewise the Exopterygota. There are no agreed alternatives at present, so the taxonomy is left in its traditional form.

The Endopterygota is made up of all the insects which have complete metamorphosis. It is agreed to be a good monophyletic clade, even though some of the details may need to be adjusted.

[[Neoptera]]

CATEGORIES: Insects

Neoptera is a classification group that has almost all the winged insects, mostly those that can flex their wings over their abdomens. This is in contrast with the more basal orders of winged insects, which are not able to flex their wings in this way.

The Neoptera can be contrasted with the Palaeoptera, the 'ancient-winged' insects, which include the Odonata, the Ephemeroptera and extinct groups such as the Palaeodictyoptera.

[[Endopterygota]]

CATEGORIES: Insects

The Endopterygota (or Holometabola), are insects of the subclass Pterygota.

They have complete metamorphosis. This means they go through different larval, pupal, and adult stages. The larval and adult stages differ very much in their anatomy and behavior. This is called holometabolism, or complete metamorphism.

They are distinguished from the Exopterygota (or Hemipterodea) by the way in which their wings develop. Endopterygota ("internal winged forms") develop wings inside the body during metamorphosis.

The earliest endopterygote fossils date from the Carboniferous.

The main principle is that "all human rights are universal, indivisible and interdependent and interrelated." (Part I para 5) This means that the international community must treat all matters about human rights both economic, social and cultural rights and civil rights equallly and with the same importance without exceptions. This phase is cited also by Declaration of Montreal, Yogyakarta Principles and Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.

Strong Bad is one of the major characters of the Homestar Runner series of animated Flash web cartoons. He is portrayed by Matt Chapman, the principal voice actor and co-founder of the series. Strong Bad enjoys pranking the other characters of the series, along with his ever-diligent lackey pet named "The Cheat" and his older brother Strong Mad. The main segment that Strong Bad is a part of is "Strong Bad Email", in which he answers emails sent to him by fans. Strong Bad Email has turned into several DVDs, as well as a podcast, since its first episode in 2001.

Strong Bad is sometimes referred to as the main antagonist of the series due to his pranks that he, Strong Mad, and The Cheat play on the other characters, and his insulting of his brother Strong Sad. He seems to be a character influenced by the American popular culture trends of the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s,  

such as heavy metal music and the second and third generations of video games and video game consoles. Since he is one of the site's most popular characters, merchandise has also spun off of Strong Bad, which includes t-shirts and sweatshirts sold by the website.

Strong Bad has been one of the series most popular characters, and has been well received. In an article by National Review Online, Strong Bad was described as "a non-stop braggart, liar, manipulator, and egotist", but also "one of the coolest characters on the Internet and the real star of Homestarrunner.com, which may be the most popular homegrown animation in the world". Segments have been spun off of his emails, including "Teen Girl Squad" a comic drawn by Strong Bad about four teenage friends.

[[Old Style and New Style dates]]

CATEGORIES: History, Time

Old Style (or O.S.) and New Style (or N.S.) are terms used for calendar dates in English language historical studies, for two reasons. The first reason is that the method of dating that is most widely used around the world today, as the Gregorian calendar, was introduced into English cultures only in 1752. The second is that 1 January has not always been the first day of the year, while March 25th was the start of the year, or fiscal year, for many hundreds of years. Both of these conventions changed not very long ago, in historic terms, as just a few centuries ago. So when a date is given in a history book (or an old book), we need to know whether it is in the modern New Style or the traditional Old Style. During the time of the changeover, people would give both dates. Even today, when historians are writing about an event in those times, they often give the date as it was used at the time but also give the modern equivalent for your convenience. 

In Europe and its colonies, the Julian calendar was used traditionally. Other countries used different systems: for example China, Japan and Korea used lunisolar calendars.  

The reason for changing the calendar was that experts in the early 1700s realised that there is a mistake in the Julian calendar, that it adds too many leap years. This meant that the date of Easter was being calculated wrongly. So they designed a new calendar that corrected this error. Pope Gregory XIII had declared that this new calendar should be used from 1582 onwards. But only Roman Catholic countries accepted this ruling: Protestant and Eastern Orthodox countries refused to have the Pope tell them what to do. So even in Europe, the change happened at different times.

For example, it was not until 1752 that Great Britain and its colonies changed over to the new calendar, also changing the start of the year from 25 March to 1 January at the same time. Russia changed in 1918, after the 'October' Revolution.

The Latin words for O.S. are stili veteris or stilo vetere. These terms are used in some books worldwide. They can be shortened to st.v.

Another way of making a website more accessible would be to remove an image with flashing lights, because such images could give some people seizures.

[[Brachiosaur]]

CATEGORIES: Brachiosaurs

Brachiosaurs are a family of sauropod dinosaurs, the Brachiosauridae. They were herbivorous quadrupeds with longer forelegs than hind legs. As a result, there is also some dispute about which animals belong within this family.

The largest mounted skeleton in the world is a brachiosaur, the Giraffatitan brancai (formerly Brachiosaurus brancai) at the Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin, Germany.

Brachiosaurs first evolved in the Middle Jurassic, and died out at the end of the Lower Cretaceous, surviving for about 60 million years. The earliest known brachiosaur may be Lapparentosaurus from the Middle Jurassic of Africa. The giant Sauroposeidon from North America was one of the last brachiosaurs, living just before the end of the Early Cretaceous period. 

The name "brachiosaur" means "arm lizard", which may sound like a strange name for a four-legged animal. The family Brachiosauridae was given this name because the dinosaurs in it tended to have longer "arms" (front legs) than back legs.

[[Giraffatitan]]

CATEGORIES: Brachiosaurs, Jurassic dinosaurs, Dinosaurs of Africa

Giraffatitan ("giraffe titan") is a genus of sauropod dinosaurs which lived during the Upper Jurassic, about 140 million years ago. It was related to Brachiosaurus, and was one of the largest animals known to have walked the earth.

Giraffatitans were about 23 long and weighed about 40. They had very long necks and were well adapted for feeding on the tall conifers which were the main trees in the Jurassic forests. They lived in what is now Tanzania.

It was first named as an African species of Brachiosaurus (B. brancai) in 1914. In 1991, George Olshevsky said there were enough differences to make its own genus, creating Giraffatitan.

[[Object (grammar)]]

CATEGORIES: Grammar

An object in grammar is the target of an action, and occurs in any sentence with a transitive verb. It is an element in the clause which follows the verb, as in:

These are direct objects. The following are indirect objects:

The structure of these sentences is (S/V/O/O) where S = subject, V = verb and O = object. The first object is an indirect object, the second is a direct object. Notice that, in the last example, you sent a letter, not your son. The sentence makes perfect sense without the indirect object.

An equivalent sentence to the last example is:

Here some grammarians also see son as the indirect object (letter is the term which cannot be left out).p720

[[Subject (grammar)]]

CATEGORIES: Grammar

The subject in grammar is the agent (the 'doer') in an active sentence such as: Alan kissed Jane.

However, there is a difficulty. The following two sentences are identical in meaning:

Only in the first sentence is our children the grammatical subject. So there is a difference between the logical subject and the grammatical subject.p996 Also, many sentences have no subject, for instance:

If a sentence does have a subject, then the rest of the sentence may be called the predicate. 

[[Frigate]]

CATEGORIES: Warships, Ships

A frigate (ˈfrɪɡɨt) is a warship. The term has been used for warships of many sizes and roles for a few centuries.  During the age of sail they were small, agile ships that were extensively used in the American War of Independence, and later against the British.  Their main use was shore defense.

In the modern day the term Frigate covers a broad range of ships. This is primarily for political reasons. The generally accepted term is of a warship less that 6, 000 dwt and greater that around 2, 000 dwt. Its primary purpose is usually anti-submarine warfare. It can also be a long range patrol vessel or in smaller navies an anti-air vessel.

[[Voice (grammar)]]

CATEGORIES: Grammar

Voice in grammar expresses the way the action (or state) that the verb expresses relates to the subject or object.  In English grammar, there are two voices: active and passive. When a clause is in the active voice, the subject is the doer of the action. When a clause is in the passive voice, the subject is the receiver of the action. The active voice is much more commonly used than the passive voice.

[[Black widow]]

CATEGORIES: Spiders

Black widows are spiders. Their scientific name is Latrodectus mactans, and they share the Latrodectus name with several similar spiders (sometimes called "widow spiders). The female is shiny black and has a round abdomen with a red hourglass pattern on its underside. They are closely related to another group called Steotoda (sometimes called "false widow spiders) that contains species that are not dangerous to humans. All of the true widow spiders can give bites that are harmful to human beings and may kill children or people who are not in good health.

Female widow spiders are rather large. They have a body length of approximately 0.5 inch. The males of the widow spiders are much smaller than the females.

Both the widow spiders and the Steotoda spiders belong to a larger group that includes many kinds of spiders that make similar kinds of webs and have the same general body shape. But those spiders are not shiny black and often prefer to build their webs in sunny places.

[[Pill bug]]

CATEGORIES: Isopods

Armadillidiidae is a family of woodlice, a terrestrial crustacean group in the order Isopoda. They are commonly known as pill bugs or potato bugs or rollie pollies. Pill bugs are not insects, but are crustaceans. Crustaceans are animals with hard shells made from many pieces for protection.

Pill bugs look like gray pills. The pill bug's abdomen has seven segments. Pill bugs have flat bodies. The pill bug has three basic body parts called the head, thorax, and abdomen, moce and they can be many sizes.

The head has three eyes (simple and compound) and a mouth. Pill bugs have two sets of antennae. One of the sets is visible to see. The thorax holds the legs. The abdomen holds the exopods of uropods and is attached to some crustaceans' abdomens.  Pillbugs eat rotten plants, rotten animals, old garbage, and even bits of food in animal dung. Pill bugs do not breathe through lungs; they have gills. Because of this, they need to be in a damp place or they will die. They also prefer dark rocks or any other dark place to stay that is dark. They are more active at night and early morning because of the darkness. Pill bugs are not beneficial to potted plants. If you notice your potted plants have one or two of them crawling around on the plant, there are probably many more that you don't see feeding off of the roots.

Pill bugs have the typical lifespan of an Isopod, living two years average and five years maximum.

The Pill bugs come from a family called Armadillidiidae. 

For some people, looking for Pill Bugs in their garden is helpful to their garden and also enjoyable, especially for small children. To some people, keeping Pill Bugs as pets is also an enjoyable thing. To keep a Pill Bug as a pet, it's area which it is kept in must be moist and/or damp, with plants that are fresh and plants that have begun to rot. Pill Bugs are still garden animals so please remember you cannot keep them or their full life and should never, under any circumstances, be released back into the wild once rescued.

[[Druze]]

CATEGORIES: Druze, Ethnic groups in Israel, Lebanon, Religion in Israel, Syria

The Druze are an Arabic-speaking people of the Middle East.  

There are more than 500,000 Druze. Most of them live in Syria and Lebanon. Some have emigrated to the United States and Canada.  

The Druze practice a religion related to Islam and Christianity but more based on philosophy.  Al-Hakim, a ruler of Egypt during the 11th century sponsored the religion which was created by Hamza bin Ali. The name Druze probably comes from Darazi, a preacher who was expelled from the Druze movement, because he preached that Al-Hakim was literally God.  

Although sometimes many Druze consider themselves part of Shia Islam, in Israel they are considered part of a different ethnic and religious group within the Arabic-speaking minority.

The Druze in Lebanon had a major political influence and were the rulers of Lebanon before the 1860s. After the 1860s, they shared the ruling of Mount Lebanon with the Maronites and were later considered the 4th major religious sect after independence. They played a key role in fighting against the Lebanese Christian right during the early 1980s.  The Druze ended their fighting against the Lebanese Christian right in late 1990.  In 1990 and 1991, they gained representation in Lebanon's government in accordance with a 1989 peace agreement.

[[Impressionist music]]

CATEGORIES: Music

The impressionist movement in music was a movement in Europen classical music. It was mostly in France. It began in the late 19th century and ended in the middle of the 20th century. There were two very famous composers of this movement, Claude Debussy and Maurice Ravel. Debussy actually did not like the term 'Impressionist' in his works. English impressionist musicians include Cyril Scott (1879–1970) and  John Ireland (1879–1962). Other well-known composers labeled impressionist include Paul Dukas, Gabriel Fauré, Manuel de Falla, Isaac Albéniz, Giacomo Puccini, Leoš Janáček, Alexander Scriabin and Kurt Atterberg

The first pieces of impressionist music were probably composed by Franz Liszt, the first such piece for orchestra is probably Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune, composed by Claude Debussy, between 1892 and 1894.

The impressionism of Debussy is achieved through a number of means the overall aim of which were to weaken the teleological (Purpose driven) harmonic structure of classical (functional) western harmony. In functional harmony a path is set that leads inexorably to a final cadence at which the tonic is clearly affirmed, dissonance whether through the use of suspensions or 7th chords etc. is correctly prepared and then resolved creating a flow of tension and release. By contrast, many of Debussy's dissonances simply flow onto another dissonance in chains of seventh chords etc. Another way that Debussy holds tonality in suspense is through the use of the pentatonic and whole-tone scales in both melody and harmony. The story of modernist music has been a response to the extreme chromaticism of radical romantic composers such as Wagner and Liszt. The ones who felt compelled to complete the task took music to the chromatic extreme of atonality, others found ways to continue to write music using recognisable harmonic sequences and tonal (therefore recallable) melody by emancipating the dissonance and freeing it from its functional straightjacket. Debussy played a massive part in developing the vocabulary for this kind of composition. All non-atonal composers of the modernist era owe a debt to Debussy, including Stravinsky, Bartok, Messiaen and possibly even Steve Reich.

[[Neoclassicism music]]

CATEGORIES: Music

Neoclassicism in music was popular in the twentieth-century. Mostly between the two World Wars. This kind of music is when composers try to come back to beautiful ways with the broadly defined way of "classicism", namely order, balance, clarity, economy, and emotions. Neoclassicism had two distinct national lines of development. They were French and German. Neoclassicsim was a beautiful trend rather than a movement. Many composers normally do not think of themselves as "neoclassicists." But some really do have some elements of the style.

[[Vincent d'Indy]]

CATEGORIES: French composers, 1851 births, 1931 deaths

Paul Marie Theodore Vincent d'Indy (27 March 1851–2 December 1931) was a French composer and music teacher. Born in Paris, he was encouraged to learn music by his uncle who had studied with César Franck. D'Indy later also studied with Franck at the Paris Conservatoire. He liked the music of Lizst, Beethoven and Wagner. He went to the first performance of Wagner's Ring at Bayreuth in 1876. He organized performances of works by Rameau and Monteverdi whose work had been mostly forgotten. He was a very conservative in his views on music, and after his proposed changes to the Conservatoire were ignored, he set up his own music school, the Schola Cantorum in 1894.

[[Edgard Varèse]]

CATEGORIES: 1883 births, 1965 deaths, French composers

Edgard Victor Achille Charles Varèse, whose name was also spelled Edgar Varèse (December 22, 1883 – November 6, 1965), was a French composer who spent the greater part of his career in the United States.

Varèse's music has an emphasis on timbre and rhythm. He made up the term "organized sound." This phrase means that some timbres and rhythms can be grouped together. Although his finished works only last about three hours, he has been thought as an influence by many big composers of the late 20th century. His use of new instruments and electronic resources led to his being known as the "Father of Electronic Music" while Henry Miller described him as "The stratospheric Colossus of Sound".

[[Text grammar]]

CATEGORIES: Grammar, Literature, Linguistics

A text grammar is the study of texts above the level of the sentence. It shows how texts are put together so as to convey ideas, facts, messages, and fiction. 

A similar term is discourse analysis. Both are mostly concerned with natural language use; discourse analysis would include spoken language. Speech is also the parent of rhetoric, the ancient study of persuasive speaking. In a similar way, literary criticism parallels text grammar, because both concentrate on the printed word. A text grammar approach puts emphasis on the linguistic structure of a text, rather than its cultural or symbolic meaning.

A text is a coherent body of sentences. Coherent means they are linked by a consistent theme. The text ends when completion is signalled. For example, when a problem introduced at the start is solved, or when a promised discussion has reached a conclusion.  

[[Discourse analysis]]

CATEGORIES: Linguistics

Discourse analysis is a subject which studies a text or a conversation. This is a subject in linguistics which does not study sentences, like in syntax, but the entire text or conversation. The text or conversation is known as discourse. Discourse analyst prefer to use real life discourse in their studies, rather than invented sentences like in traditional linguistics. This way of studying real life discourse is called corpus linguistics. 

Discourse analysis is related to text linguistics. However, text linguistics studies how discourse is structured so that they are connected (how sentences are joined to each other). Discourse analysis studies this, and also how the discourse is connected to the context. This context includes who the people talking or writing are, the social and cultural context. Also, it studies the way mode, which is the way the language is represented (is it a letter, speech, email, Internat chat?), influences discourse. Discourse analysis is also interested in the genre (topic) of the discourse. 

Discourse analysis is studied not only in linguistics, but also in sociology, anthropology, psychology, communication studies and translation studies.

[[Aphaenogaster kimberleyensis]]

CATEGORIES: Ants

Aphaenogaster kimberleyensis is a species of ant in Australia. It has been found and described by Shattuck, S. O. in 2008. It's habitat is mainly forested areas, ranging from rainforests to woodlands. They build their nests using soil mounds that are more extensive than the mounds made by most ants.

[[Aphaenogaster]]

CATEGORIES: Ants

Aphaenogaster is a genus of myrmicine ants. Almost 200 species have been described. Also, 11 fossil species are known. They live worldwide except from South America and Southern Africa. 

They are often confused with Pheidole or Pheidologeton. These two have major and minor workers, while Aphaenogaster has only a single worker caste. Pheidole has a 3-segmented club on its antenna. But Aphaenogaster has four segments and a larger body size. Pheidologeton has a 11-segmented antenna, while the antenna in Aphaenogaster is 12-segmented.

They make very thick, easily seen nests with many big entrances in a small place. These entrances can have diameters of up to 4 cm and are up to 30 cm deep. This resulted in their common name funnel ants. These nests can be a bad problem for golfers or on pastures and unsealed airstrips, because the fragile ground easily breaks under pressure.

Aphaenogaster gets most of its food from tended aphids on the roots of plants. This explains that they are not commonly seen out of their tunnels. The funnel-shaped openings could play a role in trapping arthropods, which are also eaten.

Although these ants are not aggressive, they will bite when their nest is disturbed.

Life Before Life is a book written by psychiatrist Jim B. Tucker. It presents an overview of more than 40 years of reincarnation research at the University of Virginia into children's reports of past life memories. 

The book suggests that consciousness can be considered separately from the brain, which provides a basis for claims of reincarnation. Life Before Life has been translated into ten languages and the foreword to the book is written by Ian Stevenson.

Ian Stevenson, M.D., was a Canadian professor of psychiatry. He worked at the University of Virginia, in the area of parapsychology.

Stevenson thought that the idea of reincarnation might help modern medicine better understand aspects of human behavior and development. He traveled a lot over a period of 40 years to investigate 3,000 childhood cases that suggested to him the possibility of past lives. 

Stevenson saw reincarnation as the survival of the personality after death, although he never suggested a physical process by which a personality might survive death.

Stevenson's research was the subject of Jim B. Tucker's Life Before Life (2005).

[[Parapsychology]]

CATEGORIES: Parapsychology

Parapsychology is the study of psychic events. These phenomona involve the exchange of information between a person and their environment, without the use of the five senses. They include extrasensory perception (such as telepathy), influence of mind on matter (psychokinesis), anomalous experiences (such as past life experiences and near death experiences) and apparitions.  Such things have been reported for a very long time.

In 2005, Nobel Laureate Brian Josephson said that many scientists are not yet swayed by the evidence for parapsychology and the paranormal. Josephson contends that some scientists feel uncomfortable about ideas such as telepathy and that their emotions sometimes get in the way when making evaluations.

[[Handedness]]

CATEGORIES: Motor skills, Writing

Handedness is the preference for using either the left or the right side of the body for certain things. People are described as left-handed or right-handed when they prefer to write with their left or their right hand. They may prefer the use of certain hands for certain tasks.

Most people are right-handed. Many prefer to use their right eye, right foot and right ear if forced to make a choice between the two). The reasons for this are not fully understood. 

Ambidexterity is when a person has approximately equal skill with both hands and/or both sides of the body. True ambidexterity is very rare. In some sports work is done to even up the influence of the non-dominant side. Soccer is a good example.

[[Andromeda galaxy]]

CATEGORIES: Spiral galaxies, Local galaxies

The Andromeda galaxy is the nearest spiral galaxy to the Milky Way, our galaxy. Andromeda is sometimes called M31 or NGC 224 by astronomers. It is about 2.6 million light years away from us. In other words, we see it as it was 2.6 million years ago.

The galaxy looks like a dim, fuzzy star to the naked eye: We can only see the central part through a telescope.

Andromeda is the largest galaxy of the Local Group, which consists of the Andromeda galaxy, the Milky Way galaxy, the Triangulum galaxy, and about 30 other smaller galaxies.  Although the largest, Andromeda may not be the most massive. Recent findings suggest that the Milky Way contains more dark matter and may be the most massive in the group.

The 2006 observations by the Spitzer Space Telescope revealed that M31 contains a trillion stars (1012). This is more than the number of stars in our own galaxy, which is estimated to be c. 200-400 billion.

Andromeda is estimated to be 7.111 solar masses. In comparison, a 2009 study estimated that the Milky Way and Andromeda are about equal in mass, 

At an apparent magnitude of 3.4, the Andromeda galaxy is notable for being one of the brightest Messier objects. It visible to the naked eye on moonless nights even when viewed from areas with moderate light pollution. Although it appears more than six times as wide as the full Moon when photographed by a larger telescope, only the brighter central region is visible to the naked eye. Being both large and bright, it is one of the farthest objects that can be seen without a telescope or binoculars.

The Andromeda galaxy is approaching the Milky Way at about 100 to 140 kilometres per second (62 to 87 mi/s), so it is one of the few blue shifted galaxies. The Andromeda galaxy and the Milky Way are thus expected to collide in perhaps 4.5 billion years. The Milky Way–Andromeda collision is likely to make the galaxies merge, to form a giant elliptical galaxy. Such events do happen in galaxy groups. However, 4.5 billion years is a vast period of time, roughly equal to the time the Earth has existed as a planet.

[[Mechanical bull]]

CATEGORIES: Amusement rides

A mechanical bull, also known as a Rodeo Bull or Bucking Bronco is a machine that gives the rider sense of riding a bucking animal such as a rodeo bull or horse.  

Its speed can be made faster or slower.  Padded flooring is often used around the machine in order to prevent injury to those thrown off it. 

A special motor lets the operator to safely control the ride and safety for the rider; this motor allows the operator to stop the ride before a rider is thrown off the machine.  The trained operator at the speed control box controls the unit’s speed as well as spin direction.  The equipment has the ability of starting rides very slowly and can be advanced to faster speeds if a rider is able to handle them.  It can go slow and simply spin for beginners and run at a more advanced speed for experts or professionals.

Mechanical bulls have been around for decades as a training machine for rodeo riders, as they enable a rider to improve their rodeo performance and skills without the risk.  Although mechanical bulls are still used for rodeo training, they are also used as an amusement ride,  both as party entertainment and entertainment found in bars, restaurants, and clubs.

As a form of entertainment, the mechanical bull often includes a saddle (even though saddles are not used in real bull riding) and often a model of the head of a bull, complete with horns.   One of the earliest uses as a form of entertainment was at  Bertrand Island Amusement Park in New Jersey), where  a mechanical bucking bronco ride was introduced in the 1930s, under the name of "Ride 'Em Cowboy!".

The commercial use of mechanical bulls gained popular appeal with the release of the 1980 movie Urban Cowboy.  In this movie John Travolta and Debra Winger showed the riding a mechanical bull.  The mechanical bull used in this movie was the El Toro brand of mechanical bull.  This brand of mechanical bull is still being made, but does not carry the same safety features that are available on more current models. Mechanical bulls can also be seen in the films Stir Crazy, and Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle. In the movie Barnyard, in the night barn, a "Mechanical Man" is seen (as the main characters are cows).

In the television show Strangers with Candy, Jerri Blank's physical education class is uses mechanical bull riding.

A bucking bronco was originally a cowboy term for a horse that jumps about with stiff knees and an arched back.

[[Suda]]

CATEGORIES: Byzantine Empire, Encyclopedias, Literature

The Suda or Souda (Σοῦδα) is a massive 10th century Byzantine encyclopedia of the ancient Mediterranean world. It is an encyclopedic dictionary, written in Greek, with 30,000 entries. The derivation is probably from the Byzantine Greek word souda, meaning 'fortress' or 'stronghold'.

The Suda is somewhere between a grammatical dictionary and an encyclopedia in the modern sense. It explains the source, derivation, and meaning of words according to the philology of its period. There is nothing especially important about this aspect of the work. It is the articles on literary history that are valuable. These entries supply details and quotations from authors whose works are otherwise lost. 

This lexicon represents a convenient work of reference for persons who played a part in political, ecclesiastical, and literary history in the East down to the tenth century. The chief source for this is the encyclopedia of Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus (912–959), and for Roman history the excerpts of John of Antioch (seventh century).

The work deals with biblical as well as pagan subjects, from which it is inferred that the writer was a Christian. A prefatory note gives a list of dictionaries from which the lexical portion was compiled, together with the names of their authors. The work is uncritical, and probably much added to, and the value of the articles is very unequal. Nevertheless, it contains much information on ancient history and life.

The Souda has a near-contemporaneous Islamic parallel, the Kitab al-Fehrest of Ibn al-Nadim.

[[Implication and inference]]

CATEGORIES: Grammar, Human communication

Implication and inference are two related words which are opposites.

To imply is to suggest something is true without actually saying it. Examples:

To infer is to see the implication in the sentence. When you realize the meaning of the second sentence, and protest "I have never beaten her", you have made an inference. 

Here are the rules:

An implication is always verbal, but inferring is not always verbal. A non-verbal response might show the indirect message (implication) had been accurately interpreted (inferred) by the receiver. Example: I hate you! may contain unspoken implications, according to circumstance and tone of voice. Between two lovers it might mean:

[[Nonverbal communication]]

CATEGORIES: Non-verbal communication

Nonverbal communication (NVC) uses signals without words. Language is not the only way to communicate, there are other means. Much nonverbal communication is unconscious: it happens without people thinking about it.

NVC may use gestures and touch, body language or posture, facial expression and eye contact. NVC may be communicated through objects such as clothing and hairstyles. Dance is also a type of nonverbal communication.

Speech has nonverbal elements known as paralanguage. These include voice quality, emotion and speaking style, rhythm, intonation and stress. Likewise, written texts have nonverbal elements such as handwriting style, spatial arrangement of words, or the use of emoticons, such as :).

Nonverbal communication has three main aspects: the situation where it takes place, the communicators, and their behavior during the interaction.p7

[[Triangular number]]

[[Pair production]]

CATEGORIES: Wave physics

In physics, pair production is what happens when a photon interacts with the nucleus of an atom, instead of the electron like in lower level x-ray interactions. The photon gives its energy to the nucleus and then creates a pair of positively and negatively charged electrons. The positive electron (positron) ionizes until it combines with a free electron. The two particles scatter in opposite directions. 

The probability of pair production is proportional to the energy of the incoming photons and is affected by the material's atomic number. Pair production usually happens with energy levels over 25 MeV. Pair production happens sometimes in radiation therapy treatments with high-energy photon beams.

It is somewhat related to photoelectric effect.

[[Sexual selection]]

CATEGORIES: Evolutionary biology

Sexual selection is a special kind of natural selection. It is a theory of Charles Darwin that certain traits can be explained by competition within a species.

Darwin defined sexual selection as the effects of the "struggle between the individuals of one sex, generally the males, for the possession of the other sex". It is usually males who fight each other. Traits selected by male combat are called secondary sexual characteristics. They include horns, antlers, which are sometimes referred to as 'weapons'. 

Traits selected by mate choice are called 'ornaments'. Females often prefer to mate with males with external ornaments  exaggerated features of morphology. Genes that enable males to develop impressive ornaments or fighting ability may simply show off greater disease resistance or a more efficient metabolism. This idea is known as the 'good genes' hypothesis. Sexual selection is still being researched and discussed today.

One author says studies on sexual selection have something important to tell us, namely "how males and females came to be what they are".

[[Blood atonement]]

CATEGORIES: Mormonism

Blood atonement was once a teaching of the Mormon Church.  Brigham Young first preached about blood atonement in the 1850s, though Joseph Smith may have thought of it first.  

Blood atonement taught that murder is so bad that the only way the murderer could pay for their sins was to be killed.  This was sometimes called "blood-for-blood" punishment because it was used to punish murder.  However, sometimes it was also used for non-violent crimes, like denying or leaving the church or marrying someone of a different race.  

The idea of blood atonement led to firing squads being allowed in Utah for many years. It also may have led to the Mountain Meadows Massacre, where Mormons killed some emigrants from Arkansas.

At one time, most Mormons believed in blood atonement.  Today, only some fundamentalists do.

[[John Michael Wright]]

CATEGORIES: 1617 births, 1694 deaths, English painters, Scottish painters

John Michael Wright (May 1617 – July 1694) was a British portrait painter in the Baroque style. 

Wright was taught in Edinburgh by the Scots painter George Jamesone. He became a famous artist and scholar during his long journey in Rome. There, he entered the Accademia di San Luca, and came to know some of the most important artists of his time. He was hired by Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria, the governor of the Spanish Netherlands in 1655. His job was to find artworks in Oliver Cromwell's England in 1655. 

He settled in England from 1656. He served there as a court painter before and after the English Restoration. A Roman Catholic, he was favoured by the Stuart court. Hired by both Charles II and James II, he saw many of the political experiences of the era. In the last years of the Stuart rule he went back to Rome as part of an embassy to Pope Innocent XI.

Today, Wright is seen as one of the most important British painters of his time. He is important mostly because of the special realism he used in his portraits. Perhaps because of his unusual experiences, he was favoured by people of the highest level of society. This was surprising in an age in which foreign artists were usually more liked. Wright's paintings of royalty and aristocracy are in the collections of many great galleries today.

Xenophanes of Colophon,  c.570 – c.475 BC, was a Greek philosopher, poet, and social and religious critic.

Our knowledge of his views comes from fragments of his poetry, surviving as quotations by later Greek writers. To judge from these, his poetry criticized and satirized a wide range of ideas. This included Homer and Hesiod, the belief in the pantheon of anthropomorphic gods and the Greeks' love of athletics and athleticism. He is the earliest Greek poet who claims explicitly to be writing for future generations, creating "fame that will reach all of Greece, and never die while the Greek kind of songs survives".

[[Canaanite]]

CATEGORIES: Bible

Canaanites were a people mentioned in the Hebrew Bible, or Old Testament. Most of their land, called Canaan, later became known as Israel.  

The Canaanites settled in the region about 2000 BCE. They were the main inhabitants until about 1200 B.C. The Book of Joshua says that the Israelites conquered Canaan. However, archaeology and the Bible suggest that the Israelites only gradually became the area's main people.  Archaeology also suggests that many Canaanite cities were destroyed by the Sea Peoples, or Philistines, in the 1100s BCE. The Sea Peoples may have sailed to Canaan from the area around the Aegean Sea.  

The Canaanites were a Semitic people related to the Phoenicians, Amorites, Assyrians and Israelites.  The Canaanites had a developed civilization.  Their main political group was the city-state. In a city-state, a king ruled a city or town and the villages and land around it.  The Bible mentions a number of Canaanite tribes.

The chief Canaanite gods were El (a creator god) and Baal (a storm god).  The main goddesses were Anat, Asherah, and Astarte.  They were fertility goddesses.

Sovacool sees no role for nuclear power in a clean energy transition.

The Dirty Energy Dilemma won a 2009 Nautilus Award.

[[Governor of New South Wales]]

CATEGORIES: Governors of New South Wales

The Governor of New South Wales is the oldest political office of Australia. Captain Arthur Phillip RN became the first Governor of New South Wales on 7 February 1788. The Colony of New South Wales was the first British settlement in Australia. The first governors had almost autocratic powers due to the distance from and poor communications with Great Britain. In 1824 the New South Wales Legislative Council, Australia's first legislature, was appointed to help the governor.

Between 1850 and 1861, the Governor of New South Wales was also called the Governor-General. All letters between the Australian colonies and the British Government were meant to go through the Governor-General. The other colonies had Lieutenant-Governors. As they became independent, South Australia in 1836, Tasmania January 1855 and Victoria May 1855 replaced their Lieutenant-Governors with Governors. Sir William Denison kept the title of Governor-General until h is retirement.

The Governor acts on the advice of the head of the elected government, the Premier of New South Wales. The Governor does have power of the Crown, and has the right to dismiss the Premier. This power was last used in 1932, when Sir lachlan mendham dismissed toby erin rodgers

If the Governor dies, resigns or is absent their duties are carried out by the Lieutenant Governor of New South Wales.

The Governor of New South Wales used Government House as a home, office and official reception space until 1996. The Governor's office is now in the historic Chief Secretary’s Building at 121 Macquarie Street. In 2011, the Premier of New South Wales, Barry O'Farrell, said that this would change and the governor would move back into Government House.

The first Australian-born Governor of New South Wales (or of any Australian state) was Lieutenant General Sir John Northcott in 1946. All governors since then have been Australian-born except for Gordon Samuels, who was born in the United Kingdom but came to Australia at an early age. Northcott's successor, Lieutenant General Sir Eric Woodward (1957), was the first born in New South Wales.

[[Space bar]]

CATEGORIES: Computing

The space bar, also called the 'spacebar' or 'space key', is one of the most commonly used keys on a computer keyboard. It is used to put a space into something being typed. It is at the bottom of most standard keyboard layouts, such as the QWERTY keyboard. The space bar is wider than all of the other keys on the keyboard.

On many computers, pressing the space bar at the same time as the ALT or CTRL key can activate many useful functions. For example, it can minimize a window in some operating systems. In some web browsers, pressing the space bar makes a window scroll down. Nowadays space bar games are very famous and trending people challenge each others to make maximum score. Spacebar counter and hit the spacebar is most common.

Spacebar counter is used to calculate total number of spacebar clicks that were performed during a limited time duration. The prime objective is to analyze the clicking speed and to improve the speed thereafter by using different clicking methods and time frames, well of course practicing more. Some most commonly used time durations include 5 seconds, 10 seconds, 20 seconds, 30 seconds and 60 seconds tests to measure and count the spacebar pressing speed test.

[[Tarbosaurus]]

CATEGORIES: Theropods, Tyrannosaurids, Dinosaurs of Asia

Tarbosaurus was a large carnivorous theropod dinosaur from Asia, especially Mongolia and China. It was a tyrannosaurid dinosaur which flourished between 70 and 65 million years ago, at the end of the Cretaceous period.

Tarbosaurus lived in a humid floodplain criss-crossed by river channels. In this environment, it was a predator at the top of the food chain, probably preying on other large dinosaurs like the hadrosaur Saurolophus or the sauropod Nemegtosaurus.

Tarbosaurus is known from dozens of specimens, with several complete skulls and skeletons. These remains have allowed scientific studies on its phylogeny, skull mechanics, and brain structure.

[[Torosaurus]]

CATEGORIES: Ceratopsids

Torosaurus (meaning "pierced lizard") was a large, quadrupedal, plant-eating Ceratopsian dinosaur with three horns on its large head. Torosaurus hatched from eggs and may have lived in herds.

Torosaurus lived during the Upper Cretaceous, about 70–65 million years ago, in what is now western North America. It was similar to Triceratops. Some had thought that Triceratops was a younger form of Torosaurus.

However, latest thinking is that the two are definitely different genera. In 2011, 2012 and 2013, studies of external features of known specimens decided that shape and development differences mean the two genera are not synonyms. The main problems in the "one genus" idea are: 

[[Dung beetle]]

CATEGORIES: Polyphaga

Dung beetles are beetles that feed partly or only on the dung of mammals. They are a kind of scarab beetle. All these species belong to the superfamily Scarabaeoidea, and most of them to the family Scarabaeidae. The subfamily Scarabaeinae alone has more than 5,000 species. There are dung-feeding beetles in other related families, such as the Geotrupidae (the 'earth-boring dung beetles'). 

Many dung beetles, known as rollers, roll dung into balls, which are used as a food source or brooding chambers. Other dung beetles, known as tunnelers, bury the dung wherever they find it. A third group, the dwellers, neither roll nor burrow: they simply live in dung. They are often attracted by the dung burrowing owls collect.

[[Glomerular filtration rate]]

CATEGORIES: Medical tests

Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is a test used by physicians and other medical professionals to see if the kidneys are working correctly. In basic terms, it is a measurement of how much liquid and waste is passing from the blood through the tiny filters in the kidney, called the glomeruli, and out into the urine during each minute. The test measures how much creatinine is in the blood. This shows how well the kidneys are performing. In a normal healthy person the GFR stays close to the same value all of the time. The test is done by taking blood from a person and sending it to a laboratory. Normal values are between 90ml/min and 110ml/min. A value below 60ml/minute means the person has chronic renal disease and a value below 15ml/minute means the person's kidneys have stopped working.

[[Centrosaurus]]

CATEGORIES: Ceratopsia

Centrosaurus is a genus of herbivorous ceratopsian dinosaurs from the Upper Cretaceous of Canada. Their remains have been found in the Dinosaur Park Formation, dating from 76.5 to 75.5 million years ago.

Centrosaurus was first discovered near the Red Deer River in Alberta. Vast bonebeds of Centrosaurus were found in Dinosaur Provincial Park, also in Alberta. Some of these beds extend for hundreds of meters and contain thousands of individuals of all ages and all levels of completion.

This would be explained if they had perished while trying to cross a flooded river. A discovery of thousands of Centrosaurus fossils near the town of Hilda, Alberta, is believed to be the largest bed of dinosaur bones ever discovered. The area is now known as the Hilda mega-bonebed.

The genus Centrosaurus is now understood to include the fossils which used to be classified as Monoclonius.

[[Extra time]]

CATEGORIES: Sports

Extra time is more time added to a game if the score is tied at the end of normal time. Some sports do not allow some of all of their games to end in a tie. In score notation (notes about the score of the game), it is often written by the letters ET or a.e.t. a.e.t stands for "after extra time".

In tournament play, where only the winner continues to the next round, professional association football add 30 minutes of extra time to the game. The extra time is made up of two 15-minute periods. If a game is still tied after extra time, it is usually decided by kicks from the penalty mark, commonly called a penalty shootout. 

Extra time is also used in other sports. Some of these sports are rugby union and rugby league, where extra time is usually 20 minutes long. In Australian rules football, two five-minute extra time periods are played in knockout finals matches when scores are tied at the end of the final quarter. In Gaelic football (and hurling), two halves of ten minutes are played after a draw. In major Gaelic football tournaments, extra time is only used if a replay finishes in a tie. In field hockey matches, extra time of 7½ minutes each way is played.

In North American sports, extra time is usually referred to as "overtime"; for ice hockey, it is usually "sudden death", which means that the overtime period ends with the first score made. In college football, a system of alternating possessions beginning at the opponent's 25-yard line is used which plays out similarly to extra innings in baseball in that each team receives a chance to score, and if the game is still tied, another iteration occurs.

[[Binaural beats]]

CATEGORIES: Sound, Neurology, Hearing

A binaural beat is an auditory illusion. It is perceived when two different pure-tone sine waves are presented to a listener, one tone to each ear. 

For example, if a 530 Hz pure tone is presented to a subject's right ear, while a 520 Hz pure tone is presented to the subject's left ear, the listener will perceive the illusion of a third tone. The third sound is called a binaural beat, and in this example would have a perceived pitch correlating to a frequency of 10 Hz, that being the difference between the 530 Hz and 520 Hz pure tones presented to each ear.

They may help people with pain when they are in hospital.  Some people use binaural beats to help them sleep, meditate or have out of body experiences.  There are computer programs and smartphone programs that make binaural beats.

Many of the claims are not verified at present.

[[David Pall]]

CATEGORIES: 1914 births, 2004 deaths, Deaths from Alzheimer's disease, Canadian scientists

David Boris Pall (2 April 1914 - 21 September 2004), founder of Pall Corporation, was the chemist who invented the Pall filter used in blood transfusions.

Born in Thunder Bay, Ontario of Russian immigrant parents, he grew up on a farm in Saskatchewan, and attended McGill University, from which he was granted a bachelor's degree in chemistry and a Ph.D. in physical chemistry. He moved to New York in 1938 and became a part of the Manhattan Project.  In 1946, he established Pall Corporation.  The company's initial focus was on the development of filters for use in aircraft hydraulics. 

However, in 1959, when  Dr. Pall's first wife, Josephine, died of aplastic anemia, he began to work on the Pall filter.  Mrs. Pall had undergone multiple blood transfusions in the course of an illness, which were ultimately unsuccessful.  The Pall filter makes blood transfusions significantly safer by filtering out white blood cells, thereby reducing the incidence of transfusion reactions and viral infections.  Today, Pall Corporation has sales in excess of $2.0 Billion.

In his lifetime, Dr. Pall received over 180 patents and in 1990, he received the United States National Medal of Technology from President George H.W. Bush.

Pall, a trustee of the North Shore University Hospital, died of complications of Alzheimer's disease at his last home in Roslyn Estates, New York.  

[[Barosaurus]]

CATEGORIES: Dinosaurs of North America, Dinosaurs of Africa, Jurassic dinosaurs, Diplodocids

Barosaurus was a large, long-necked, plant-eating dinosaur which lived about 156 to 145 million years ago. The name Barosaurus means "heavy lizard"; this giant was named by paleontologist Othniel C. Marsh in 1890. Barosaurus fossils have been found in western North America and East Africa.

Barosaurus was differently proportioned to its close relative Diplodocus. It had a longer neck and shorter tail, but was about the same length overall. It was longer than Apatosaurus, but its skeleton was less robust.

Sauropod skulls are rarely preserved, and scientists have yet to discover a Barosaurus skull.

[[Djefatnebti]]

CATEGORIES: Ancient Egyptian queens

Djefatnebti was Ancient Egyptian queen of the 3rd dynasty. She lived at the end of that dynasty. She was a wife of Pharaoh Huni and mother of Queen Hetepheres I. We know for her and her name from a vessel from Elephantine. 

Title of Djefatnebti was Great one of the hetes-sceptre. 

[[Meresankh I]]

CATEGORIES: Ancient Egyptian queens, 3rd millennium BC

Meresankh I was Ancient Egyptian queen of the 3rd dynasty of Egypt. She was a lesser ranked wife of Pharaoh Huni, mother of Pharaoh Sneferu, grandmother of Pharaoh Khufu. One of her great-granddaughters was named Meresankh II. 

Name of Meresankh appears on a fragment of the Palermo Stone. She is also mentioned at Meidum. 

Title of Meresankh was King's Wife. 

Queens' name means "She Loves Life". Here is a name of this queen written in hieroglyphs:

[[Huni]]

CATEGORIES: Pharaohs

Huni was the last Pharaoh of Egyptian Third dynasty. He was successor of Khaba, and maybe Khaba's son. Huni established a fortress on the island of Elephantine, and he maybe built pyramid in Meidum.

One of officials of king Djoser was also named Huni, and it's possible that this man and pharaoh Huni are the same person. 

Huni had two wives - Djefatnebti and Meresankh I. With Djefatnebti, he fathered Hetepheres I, and with Meresankh he sired Sneferu, his own successor. Sneferu became a king after Huni's death, and he married his half-sister Hetepheres. Huni's grandson - son of Sneferu - was pharaoh Khufu, who built Great Pyramid of Giza.

[[Peace treaty]]

CATEGORIES: Treaties, Documents, Dispute resolution

A peace treaty is a formal (official) agreement which ends a conflict. The conflict is usually between countries or governments, but may be between any other kind of group. The conflict is usually armed conflict, such as war, or serious disputes which might lead to war.

A peace treaty is different from an armistice, which is an agreement to cease hostilities, or a surrender, in which one side agrees to give up its arms.

Peace treaties are made in stages:

Peace treaties may include various items:

[[Khaba]]

CATEGORIES: Pharaohs

Khaba was a Pharaoh of the 3rd dynasty of Ancient Egypt. His predecessor was Sekhemkhet, and his successor was Huni. Khaba's reign is dated from 2640 BC to 2637 BC. 

We do not know who Khaba's parents were, but it is most likely that he was a son of Sekhemkhet and his wife Djeseretnebti. It is possible that Khaba was a father of Huni and grandfather of Sneferu. 

Khaba's name means "the soul appears". 

[[Monoamine oxidase inhibitor]]

CATEGORIES: Drugs used in psychiatry

Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitors (RIMAs) are a type of antidepressant drugs given for the treatment of depression. They are good at treating atypical depression, Parkinson's disease, anxiety disorders, social phobia and have also shown to help people to stop smoking tobacco.

As MAOIs drugs can be fatal if someone takes too much, they are usually only ever given when other antidepressant drugs have failed. Some newer drugs such as selegiline and moclobemide have proven to be safer than the older MAOIs and are prescribed by physicians in the first instance.

[[Isoform]]

CATEGORIES: Molecular biology, Biochemistry

A protein isoform is any of several different forms of the same protein. Different forms of a protein may be produced from related genes, or may be made from the same gene by alternative splicing. A large number of isoforms are caused by single-nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs, small genetic differences between alleles of the same gene. These occur at specific individual nucleotide (building block of dna-strand) positions within a gene.

[[Google Wave]]

CATEGORIES: Google

Google Wave is an internet application made by Google. Google describes Wave as an application which "lets you communicate and collaborate in real time". This means that Wave can be used for several people to edit a document at the same time, or for a group discussion. Waves can be used in a similar way to a forum, or just for emails and instant messaging between two or more people.

To use Google Wave in some browsers like Internet Explorer, you have to install Google Chrome Frame. This makes Internet explorer behave like Google Chrome on the Wave website. This is needed because Internet Explorer does not have enough features for Wave to work: it does not have full HTML5 support.

Google Wave was discontinued in 2010. It has been open sourced as Apache Wave.

[[Annihilationism]]

CATEGORIES: Christian eschatology, Afterlife

Annihilationism (also called conditional immortality) is something that some Christians believe. People who are annihilationists believe that those who do not go to heaven do not live forever in hell, but instead die and no longer exist. (Annihilationists often believe that people are punished for a period of time in hell before they stop existing). Most Christians are not annihilationists. Famous Christian writers who have written in favor of annihilationism include Edward Fudge, John Wenham, and Clark Pinnock. Christians who have written against annihilationism include J.P. Moreland, Robert Peterson, and Ron Rhodes.

Groups that believe in annihilationism include Seventh-day Adventists and Jehovah's Witnesses.

[[Wenzhou]]

CATEGORIES: Cities in China, Zhejiang

Wenzhou (温州) is an important city in the Zhejiang province of the People's Republic of China.  It has two satellite cities and six counties. In 2007, it had 7,645,700 living in it. It is in a very mountainous place. Because of that, it had been separated for a long time from the rest of the country. This made its culture and language very different from other areas.

Wenzhou was a prosperous foreign treaty port, which remains well-preserved today. It is in a very mountainous region and, as a result, has been isolated for most of its history from the rest of the country, making the local culture and language very different from those of neighbouring areas. Many of its people move to other countries like Europe and the United States. It is also famous for its oranges and bamboo.

[[Fabrosaurus]]

CATEGORIES: Ornithischia, Dinosaurs of Africa

Fabrosaurus was a small, early, plant-eating dinosaur that lived in Africa during the Lower Jurassic, roughly 199 to 189 million years ago (mya). Very little is known about Fabrosaurus since only a portion of a jaw has been found. Fabrosaurus is a dubious genus; it may be the same dinosaur as Lesothosaurus.

[[Lesothosaurus]]

CATEGORIES: Ornithischia

Lesothosaurus was a small, early, lightly-built dinosaur. It was an herbivore (plant-eater) and a fast, agile runner. It was small and lizard-like, about 3 feet (1 m) long. It walked on two long legs, had four-toed feet, five-fingered hands, short arms, a long pointed tail, a flexible neck, and a small head. Its head was short and flat with large eyes. It had sharp, pointed front teeth and arrow-like cheek teeth, but its lower jaw ended in toothless bone. 

The place of this species within the Ornithischia is controversial. It is probably an ornithopod.

[[Stygimoloch]]

CATEGORIES: Pachycephalosauria

Stygimoloch was a plant-eating dinosaur that had bony spikes and knobs on its skull. This bipedal dinosaur lived during the late Cretaceous period, about 68 million to 65 million years ago.

Stygimoloch are ornithischian dinosaurs that had thick, domed, spiked skulls. Pachycephalosaurs probably engaged in head-butting both as a defense and in intra-species rivalry.

Pachycephalosauruses are small creatures.

[[Hypacrosaurus]]

CATEGORIES: Hadrosauridae

Hypacrosaurus (meaning "almost the largest lizard") was a large, plant-eating, hollow-crested duck-billed dinosaur similar to Corythosaurus. It was about 30 feet (9 m) long, had almost 40 rows of cheek teeth, and a short toothless beak. A row of long spines from its vertebrae formed a high fin along its back. The fossils are dated as 75 to 67 million years ago. 

It is known from the remains of two species  in the Upper Cretaceous of Alberta, Canada, and Montana, United States. It is the latest hollow-crested duckbill known from good remains in North America. It was an obscure genus until the discovery in the 1990s of nests, eggs, and hatchlings belonging to one of the species.

[[HiT Entertainment]]

HiT Entertainment was a British-American entertainment company owned by Mattel and was originally established in 1982 as Henson International Television, the international distribution arm of Jim Henson Productions. They were known for owning and distributing shows such as Thomas & Friends, Barney & Friends, Bob the Builder, Fireman Sam, Pingu, and Angelina Ballerina. They also provided distribution rights for several titles in the Jim Henson library that weren't owned by Disney or Sesame Workshop, and were responsible for the US distribution of The Wiggles videos from 2001 to 2007.

From mid 2001 to early 2002, HiT distributed five of Big Idea's VeggieTales videos and one album as a result of acquiring the company's mass market distributor, Lyrick Studios.

Because Big Idea had not made a partnership with HiT Entertainment (primarily because HiT was not usually interested in working with properties they did not own), Big Idea turned to Warner Home Video to serve as their new mass market distributor in 2002. HiT responded to this by filing a lawsuit against them in federal court for "breach of contract."

Their lawsuit against Big Idea was one of the major causes of Big Idea's bankruptcy in 2003 shortly after the release of Jonah: A VeggieTales Movie.

In 2009, when Entertainment Rights was facing bankruptcy, HiT was one of three bidders to potentially purchase the company's library.

On February 1, 2012, HiT Entertainment was acquired by Mattel, and was eventually folded into their TV division, Mattel Creations, on March 31, 2016.

[[Procompsognathus]]

CATEGORIES: Coelophysidae

Procompsognathus was a small, speedy theropod dinosaur. This meat-eater lived during the late Triassic period, about 210 million years ago (mya). It probably ate insects and lizards in a relatively dry, inland environment. 

Procompsognathus may have been about one meter long (3.3 ft), 

A biped, Procompsognathus had long hind legs, short arms, large clawed hands, a long slender snout with many small teeth, and a stiff tail. The tibia is approximately 20% longer than the femur in Procompsognathus. This suggests that they were good runners.

She wrote three memoirs about the imperial family and about her own escape from Russia. In her book "Before the Storm", Sophie describes a side of old Russia seldom seen elsewhere, a family in the old fashioned provincial country life of the gentry in the years before the revolution. When she saw the famous imposter, Anna Anderson, who was at first claiming to be Grand Duchess Tatiana, she did not believe her. She called her "too short" to be Tatiana. When Anderson later claimed to be Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia, the Baroness said that Anderson "does not physically resemble her in the least".

[[Blood and soil]]

CATEGORIES: Political philosophy, Nazism

Blood and soil is a concept first developed in the 19th century. It looks at a person's blood, to see where they come from, and who their ancestors were. It also looks at the soil a person is working on, to make a claim that they should indeed work and occupy that land. In the nineteenth century, the idea was linked to racism and to nationalism. 

One of the first to use Blut und Boden, or blood and soil was Oswald Spengler in his book Der Untergang des Abendlandes. In the book, Spengler talks about the struggle of blood and soil about the inner form of a relocated species of animal and man. Walther Darré took the phrase and established the link. In his book "Neuadel aus Blut und Boden" (New nobility from blood and soil) he tries to show the relation between economic and agrarian policies, as well as racial ones.

Another idea of the blood and soil ideology comes from Lamarckism: The ethnic characteristics of a population are linked to the geographical regions it inhabits; only in this region will it be able to fully live up to its potential.

There is also a literary genre called blood and soil. In it, it shows an agrarian society living up to this ideals. People writing in this style were Gerhard Schumann and Herbert Böhme. The ideas are also sometimes shown in artworks. Artists included Adolf Ziegler, Arthur Kampf, Arno Breker and Josef Thorak. Very often, such artworks were seen as degenerate art when the Nazi party came to power. Artists had to flee, many died in exile.

Today, the phrase is associated with Nazi ideology. White supremacist gathers at the 2017 Charlottesville riots were heard chanting "blood and soil", presumably to align themselves with Nazism.

[[Argentinosaurus]]

CATEGORIES: Titanosaurs, Cretaceous dinosaurs

Argentinosaurus was a titanosaurid sauropod dinosaur. It was an enormous, long-necked, long-tailed, quadrupedal, plant-eater from Argentina, South America during the Cretaceous period.

Argentinosaurus meaning "Argentina lizard", was named by paleontologists Coria & José Bonaparte in 1993. It is known from fossilized back vertebrae, tibia, ribs and sacrum, found in Neuquén Province. It may be the largest dinosaur, but its remains are so incomplete that palaeontologists prefer to use Saltasaurus for their calculations. An accurate estimate was got for the much more complete sub-adult Dreadnoughtus.

[[Hornbill]]

CATEGORIES: Coraciiformes

It is also the state bird of Kerala.

The female hornbill lays her eggs in a hole in a tree. Then, helped by her mate, she seals herself in, covering the entrance with droppings and mud. Only a small slit is left, through which the male gives her food. This keeps the nest safe from snakes until the chicks are grown enough to leave the nest, and learn how to fly.

Riojasaurus had a heavy body, bulky legs, and a long neck and tail. Its leg bones were dense and massive for a prosauropod. By contrast, its vertebrae were lightened by hollow cavities, and unlike most prosauropods, Riojasaurus had four sacral vertebrae instead of three.

It probably moved slowly on all fours and could not rear up on its back legs. The nearly equal length of the fore and hindlimbs is also suggestive of a quadrupedal animal.

[[Constitution of the United Kingdom]]

CATEGORIES: Government of the United Kingdom, Constitutions

The Constitution of the United Kingdom is a set of laws and rules in the United Kingdom that governs how the country is organized and the basic rights and freedoms of the people.

The UK's constitution is not written in one single document like many other countries' are. In fact, the UK's constitution is not completely written down at all. Some of it can be found in writing, starting with the Magna Carta of 1215 and the Bill of Rights Act 1689 and including more modern Acts of Parliament. Other parts of it are considered common law and are made up of the decisions of judges over many hundreds of years in a system called legal or judicial precedence. Because of this, some people say that the United Kingdom has a de facto or "unwritten" constitution.

Using the word "unwritten" is a problem, because most British laws and rules are written as statutes, or court judgments, the law of equity and in various treaties. Most of these laws come from the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Because most of the constitution is written down in this way, it is not technically correct to call it "unwritten" or "de facto". However, these words are still used. The Constitution of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is even more different to most other constitutions in that it is just a normal set of laws, and not a "higher" law that the government cannot easily change. The constitution has no more authority than any other law in the UK, and the government can change it just by passing a new Act.

[[Hatshepsut]]

CATEGORIES: Ancient Egypt, Pharaohs

Hatshepsut (1507–1458 BC), meaning Foremost of Noble Ladies, was the fifth Pharaoh of the 18th dynasty of Ancient Egypt. She reigned longer than any other woman of an indigenous Egyptian dynasty, and successfully. 

Her father was Thutmose I. Her predecessor was Thutmose II (her husband). Her successor was Thutmose III, her nephew, the son of Thutmose II by a lesser wife. Thutmose III was co-regent with his stepmother, and was head of the army, but Hatshepsut was the effective ruler, and the named Pharaoh.

Today it is generally recognized that Hatshepsut assumed the position of Pharaoh. The length of her reign usually is given as twenty-two years. The third-century B.C. historian, Manetho, gave that figure of twenty-one years and nine months, and he had access to many records that now are lost. She died in 1458 BC, which means that she became pharaoh in about 1479 BC.

[[Slime mould]]

CATEGORIES: Microbiology, Protista

Slime moulds, or slime molds, are forms of life which live on the rainforest floor, and many other parts of the world. They slither over ground and fallen tree trunks in search of food. They scatter spores, like plants, which grow into new slime moulds.

They are a way of life, or life-form, which has evolved a number of times. Because they are not a monophyletic group, they are put into several different phyla. They have some features of fungi and some features of protozoa. This was discussed by Anton de Bary in 1858.

They spend part of their lives as isolated cells, but come together when a chemical signal is released. Then together, they form a multicellular organism which reproduces and makes spores. So they are both single-celled and multicellular. That is not all: the multicellular form loses its cell walls, and becomes a syncytium. This is an organism with many nuclei, but few or no cell walls.

The single cells are amoeboid (amoeba-like) and haploid (one set of chromosomes, like our gametes). The multi-nuclear stage is called a plasmodium. It is diploid, formed from fusions between pairs of amoeboid cells. It gains nutrition by phagocytosing bacteria and food particles.

As the food supply fades, the plasmodium makes haploid cells by meiosis, and they form the basis of spores. The spores are kept and then distributed from a structure like a sporangium. This life-cycle is typical of the main group called Mycetozoa.

CATEGORIES: Spiders

Crab spiders are the Thomisidae family of spiders. The group has 170 genera with over 2000 species.

They have two front pairs of legs angled outward and bodies that are flattened and often angular. Also, like crabs, Thomisidae spiders can move sideways or backwards. 

Crab spiders are hunters and ambushers. Some species sit on or among flowers, bark, fruit or leaves where they grab visiting insects. Crab spiders use their powerful front legs to grab and hold onto prey while paralyzing it with a venomous bite.

They are camouflaged: several different types are known. Even at a close range, it is difficult to see the spider. Some species are disguised as birds' droppings resting on a leaf.  Crab spiders live in rainforests all over the world. They get their name from the way they scuttle around like small crabs.

[[Claude Bernard]]

CATEGORIES: 1813 births, 1878 deaths, Physiology, French scientists

Claude Bernard (12 July 1813 – 10 February 1878) was a French physiologist. He has been called "one of the greatest of all men of science". He was one of the first to suggest blind experiments to get scientific observations more free of bias. He was the first to define the term milieu interieur, which is now known as homeostasis, a later term coined by Walter Cannon.

Bernard made animal experimentation a part of the standard scientific method. He famously wrote in 1865 that "the science of life is a superb and dazzlingly lit hall which may be reached only by passing through a long and ghastly kitchen".

He was born in 1813 in Saint-Julien near Villefranche-sur-Saône. He wrote comedies and other plays. When he was 21 he went to Paris with his play and went to a critic. But the critic suggested for him to study medicine instead of literature.

In 1845 Bernard married Françoise Marie (Fanny) Martin for her money. Her money helped him in his experiments, but she was firmly against his methods, and founded the first French society for anti-vivisectionists. When he died Bernard was given a public funeral. This was something which had never been given by France to a man of science before.

Lee Kuan Yew (born Harry Lee Kuan Yew; 16 September 1923 – 23 March 2015), often referred to by his initials LKY, was a Singaporean statesman who served as the first Prime Minister of the Republic of Singapore from 5 June 1959 to 28 November 1990. He had also served as the second Senior Minister from 28 November 1990 to 12 August 2004 and Minister Mentor from 12 August 2004 until his retirement from the executive branch of government on 21 May 2011.

Lee was born in Singapore during British colonial rule, which was part of the Straits Settlements. He had top grades in his early education, gaining a scholarship and admission to Raffles College. During the Japanese occupation, Lee worked in private companies and as an administration service officer for the propaganda office. After the war, Lee first attended the London School of Economics, but transferred to Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge, graduating with starred-first-class honours in law in 1947. He became a barrister of the Middle Temple in 1950 before returning to Singapore, and began campaigning for Britain to give up its colonial rule of his place of birth.

He was the co-founder and first secretary-general of the People's Action Party (PAP), and led the party to a landslide electoral victory in 1959. During his leadership, Lee campaigned for a merger with other former British territories in a national referendum to form the Federation of Malaysia in 1963. However, racial issues and ideological differences led to Singapore's being forced to leave from the federation, and it became its own country on 9 August 1965.

As leader of an independent Singapore, Lee guided the country by helping it grow from an underdeveloped outpost with no natural resources into a rich highly developed country, becoming known as an Asian Tiger. He has remained one of the most influential political figures in Asia. The party which he had co-founded also still rules Singapore today.  

Lee died on 23 March 2015 from pneumonia, and the country went into a week of national mourning. He was 91 years old.

[[Peak oil]]

CATEGORIES: Energy

Peak oil is the idea that at some point an oil well, an oil field, a country, or the world, will be producing the most crude oil it can ever produce at one time.  After this point, less oil will be produced and therefore people will have to use less oil because it will cost more money.  Many scientists and governments are concerned about what will happen when there is less oil to go around.

The first person to come up with this idea was M.K. Hubbert in the 1950s and 1960s, who said that a graph of oil production looks like a curve (which we now call Hubbert's Curve).  Hubbert drew a graph in 1956 that predicted that the United States would reach its peak oil in the early 1970s.  The United States did indeed reach its peak oil in the early 1970s.  

It is unclear as to when the world's peak oil will happen, though many scientists agree that it was reached in the early 2000s or before 2020. For example, in 2010 the International Energy Agency (IEA) has said that peak oil may have happened in 2006.

[[Ozymandias]]

CATEGORIES: 19th-century British poems

Ozymandias  is a sonnet by Percy Bysshe Shelley. It was published in 1818 in the 11 January issue of The Examiner, a journal in London. It is probably Shelley's most famous short poem.

The poem has been noted for its skillful diction, and its powerful themes and imagery. The central theme of Ozymandias is the inevitable (unavoidable) ruin of leaders and empires. The message is that all leaders and the empires they build will always end up as nothing, however mighty they are.

The name Ozymandias comes from a transliteration into Greek of the throne name of Ramesses II. The sonnet paraphrases (copies in different words) the writing on the base of a statue of Ramesses. The statue is called Younger Memnon and it is from Thebes (it is now in the British Museum). The writing on the statue was recorded by Diodorus Siculus in his Bibliotheca historica. It reads: "King of Kings am I, Osymandias. If anyone would know how great I am and where I lie, let him surpass one of my works".

[[International Air Transport Association airport code]]

CATEGORIES: Airports, Geocodes

An IATA airport code, is a three-letter code that can be used to identify airports. This removes the need to write the name of the airport in full every time it is needed, instead an IATA code can be used.

An important use of these codes is on baggage tags. They will display the IATA code for the airport which the bags should be heading to, should they get lost.

[[International Civil Aviation Organization airport code]]

CATEGORIES: Airports, Geocodes

An ICAO code is the code used by pilots and air traffic controllers to identify airports simply and easily.

The code is made up of four numbers or letters. These are not the same as IATA codes, which are often simpler, and are made to sound like the airport's name. For example, people who fly from Heathrow airport, are likely to know it best as either Heathrow, or by its IATA code: LHR. They are less likely to know its ICAO code: EGLL.

The currently accepted basic format for individual trampoline competitions usually consists of two or three routines, one of which may involve a compulsory set of skills. The skills consist of various combinations of somersaults, shaped bounces, body landings and twists performed in various body positions.

[[Priapulida]]

CATEGORIES: Minor phyla

Priapulida (priapulid or penis worms) are a phylum of marine worms. Their name refers to their extensible spiny proboscis, which, in some species, may have a shape similar to that of a human penis. They live in the mud, which they eat, in comparatively shallow waters up to 90.

Their nearest relatives are probably Kinorhyncha and Loricifera with which they constitute the taxon Scalidophora. Besides arthropods and velvet worms, the priapulids are the only members of the Ecdysozoa which are relatively large in size. They feed on slow-moving invertebrates, such as polychaete worms.

Priapulid fossils are known at least as far back as the Middle Cambrian. They were probably major predators of the Cambrian period. There are only sixteen known living species of priapulid worms.

[[Kinorhyncha]]

CATEGORIES: Minor phyla

Kinorhyncha  is a phylum of small (1 mm or less) marine invertebrates. They are widespread in mud or sand at all depths of the sea. They are sometimes called mud dragons. About 150 species are known. Kinorhynchs eat either diatoms or organic material found in the mud, depending on species.

[[Loricifera]]

CATEGORIES: Minor phyla, Extremophiles

Loricifera  is a recently discovered ecdysozoan phylum of marine animals. The phylum includes the first animals known to exist in a completely anoxic environment (no oxygen at all). The phylum was described in 1983 by Reinhardt Kristensen.

They are a phylum of very small animals which live in sediment. There are now twenty-two described species, in eight genera. In addition, there are about 100 more species which have been collected, but not yet described. Their size ranges from 100 µm to about 1 mm.

Their habitat is in the spaces between marine gravel to which they attach themselves. They are among the most recently discovered groups of Metazoans. They attach themselves quite firmly to the gravel, and this explains why they remained undiscovered for so long. The first specimen was collected in the 1970s, and later described in 1983. They are found at all depths of water, in different sediment types, and in all latitudes. They have not yet been found in the fossil record.

[[Constitution of Australia]]

CATEGORIES: Government of Australia, Constitutions

The Constitution of Australia is the law that set up the Australian Commonwealth Government and says how it works. It is made up of several documents. The most important is the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia. The people of Australia voted in referendums from 1898–1900 to accept the Constitution. The Constitution was then passed as a part of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900 (Imp), an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Queen Victoria signed it on 9 July 1900. The Constitution became law on 1 January 1901. Even though the Constitution was an Act of the United Kingdom parliament, the Australia Acts took away the power of the United Kingdom parliament to change the Constitution. Now only the Australian people can change it by referendum. 

Two other laws support the Australian Constitution. The first is the Statute of Westminster, as passed by the Commonwealth as the Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1942. The second is the Australia Act 1986, which was passed by the Parliaments of every Australian state, the United Kingdom, and the Australian Federal Parliament. Together, these Acts had the effect of cutting all constitutional links between Australia and the United Kingdom. Even though the same person, Queen Elizabeth II, is the monarch of both countries, these are now separate countries.

Under Australia's common law system, the High Court of Australia and the Federal Court of Australia have the power to decide what the constitution actually means.

[[Wildlife management]]

CATEGORIES: Ecology

Wildlife management is a general term for the process of keeping wild species at desirable levels as determined by wildlife managers. Wildlife management can include game keeping, wildlife conservation and pest control.  Wildlife management has become an integrated science using disciplines such as mathematics, chemistry, biology, ecology, climatology and geography to gain the best results.

Wildlife conservation aims to halt the loss of species. It does this by taking using ecological principles to balance the needs of wildlife with the needs of people. Most wildlife is concerned with the preservation and improvement of habitats. Techniques can include reforestation, pest control, irrigation, coppicing and hedge laying.

Game keeping is the management or control of wildlife for the wellbeing of game birds. It may include killing other animals which share the same niche or predators to maintain a high population of the more profitable species, such as pheasants introduced into woodland. In his 1933 book Game Management, Aldo Leopold, one of the pioneers of wildlife management as a science, defined it as "the art of making land produce sustained annual crops of wild game for recreational use".

[[Food poisoning]]

CATEGORIES: Illnesses, Food and drink

Food poisoning is when someone gets sick from eating food or drink that has gone bad or is contaminated.

There are two kinds of food poisoning: poisoning by toxic agent or by infectious agent. Food infection is when the food contains bacteria or other microbes which infect the body after it is eaten. Food intoxication is when the food contains toxins, including bacterially produced exotoxins, which can  happen even when the microbe 

that produced the toxin is no longer present or able to cause infection. Even though it is commonly called "food poisoning", most cases are caused by a variety of pathogenic bacteria, viruses, prions or parasites that contaminate food, rather than chemical or natural toxins which are what we usually call poison. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 76 million people in the United States become ill from the food they eat, and about 5,000 of them die every year.

The Rŭngrado May First Stadium, or May Day Stadium, is a multi-purpose stadium in Pyongyang, North Korea, completed on May 1, 1989.

The stadium was built as a main stadium for the 13th World Festival of Youth and Students in 1989.

It is currently used for football matches, a few athletics matches, but most often for Arirang performances (also known as the Mass Games). The stadium can seat 150,000, which is the largest stadium in the world that is not used for auto racing.

Its name comes from the place where it is, Rungra Islet in the Taedong River, and May Day, the international day celebrating labour.

The stadium is most famous for being the place where large shows celebrating Kim Il-sung and the North Korean nation were held. In June-July 2002, the "Arirang" gymnastic and artistic performances were held there. There were 100,000+ people taking part —double the number of people watching— and was open to foreigners, which is rare. These performances now happen every year, usually in August and September. The Guinness Book of Records has recognized these events as the largest in the world.

In 2000, Kim Jong-Il used the stadium to entertain Madeleine Albright, the U.S. Secretary of State under President Bill Clinton.

[[Badwater Basin]]

CATEGORIES: Geography of California, Drainage basins

Badwater Basin is a basin in Death Valley National Park, Death Valley, California. The water which goes into it does not flow into any ocean.

Badwater Basin is the lowest point in North America, at 282 below sea level. Mount Whitney, the highest point in the 48 states, is only 76 miles west of the Basin. It is one of the lowest places in Death Valley.

Badwater Basin has a small natural pool of undrinkable water next to the road. The water comes from a spring. It is called 'Badwater' because people cannot drink the water. This is because so much salt has built up from the basin. The pool does have animals and plants living there, including pickleweed, insects, and the Badwater snail.

The pool is not actually the lowest point of the basin. The lowest point is several miles to the west, the exact point which is lowest changes.  However, the salt flats are dangerous to travel across (in many cases being only a thin white crust over mud), therefore the sign states that the lowest point is at the pool, where people can see it. Some people say that it is the lowest point in the Western Hemisphere, but this is not true. The lowest point is actually Laguna del Carbón in Argentina at -105 meters (-344 feet).

[[Truman Doctrine]]

CATEGORIES: Cold War, 1947 in the United States

A speech was made by U.S. President Harry S. Truman to the U.S. Congress on March 12, 1947. In this speech he said he thought that the United States should help Greece and Turkey to stop them being 'totalitarianists' although he meant Soviet Communism.  This became known as the Truman Doctrine.  Some historians believe that this was the start of the Cold War.  

This speech was made after the United Kingdom said that they would stop helping Greece and Turkey in February 1947 since the U.K. was also poor after the cost of World War II. This meant that Greece and Turkey would still be poor and Truman believed that a poor Eastern Europe would convert to a Communist government more easily unless helped by the United States. Truman wrongly thought that the Soviets were helping the Greek Communist partisans when there was no clear proof.

This plan was a big change to American politics. Political historian Walter LaFeber wrote that 'the doctrine became an ideological shield' which means that he believed that the United States used the doctrine as an excuse or reason. The Marshall Plan came after because of this.

In the Galapagos Islands the tree was planted by farmers as a crop for the quinine. It has become a dominant species on Santa Cruz Island, taking over from the shrub Miconia and Fern-Sedges. It is also invasive in Hawaii on Maui and the Big Island.

Attempts have been made to control the plant in the Galapagos National Park using a variety of methods. It is not affected by many poisons, it will regrow from a stump or any piece of root left in the ground. Controlling it over all of Santa Cruz island would cost several million US dollars according to research by the Charles Darwin Foundation.

[[AIDS orphan]]

CATEGORIES: HIV/AIDS

An AIDS orphan is a child who became an orphan because at least one of their parents died of AIDS. (An orphan is a child with no parents.)

The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), use the term "AIDS orphan" to talk about children whose mothers died of AIDS before the child's 15th birthday, whether the child's father is still alive or not. Because of this, some people say that 80% of all "AIDS orphans" still have one parent who is still alive.

There are 70,000 new AIDS orphans a year.  People in the past have guessed that by the year 2010, over 20 million children would be AIDS orphans.

Because most people who get AIDS are people who have sex, most people who die of AIDS are people who make most of their family's money (because most people who have sex are old enough to work). This means that many AIDS orphans need help from their country's government to live, and need money. This happens a lot in Africa especially.

In 2007, South Africa had more AIDS orphans than any other country, (although South Africa uses the term "AIDS orphan" differently than UNICEF and WHO. South Africa uses the term to talk about children under age 18 who lost either their father or their mother to AIDS). In 2005, the country with the highest percentage of AIDS orphans among the country's orphans was Zimbabwe.

[[Endianness]]

CATEGORIES: Microprocessor design

Endianness refers to how hexadecimal data is ordered in machine language, the simplest, most understandable code that a computer can use.

In computer coding, certain numbers, usually two bytes long (1 byte = 8 bits) that are called "words", can be written or input in two ways: little-endian and big-endian. It depends on the data format and the way the computer reads the data.

Say that we have a "word" like this:

12AB ---> 12 | AB

Now, the way it's written right now is big-endian, because the bigger number is on the end. (In hexadecimal, the numbers go from 0 to 9, then from A to F. After F, a 1 is added to the front. F+1=10, which is 16 in our numbering system)

To write it in little-endian, we simply switch the positions of the first two and the last two pieces, so it becomes:

12AB ---> AB | 12

A padlock is a type of portable lock that has a U-shaped shackle that will not come apart from the body of the lock unless the correct key is inserted or the correct combination is dialed.

[[Market economy]]

CATEGORIES: Economics

A market economy is economy in which the prices of the products and services are chosen in a free price system that is decided by supply and demand. It began around the late 18th century, after the Industrial Revolution. A key work was Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations, 1776.

Market economics has been widely used because of its efficiency (ability to work well). However, it has also been criticized for its selfishness and the difference between the rich and poor. In the real world, market economies are not purely market economies, as societies and governments control them in some ways instead of market forces. The expression free-market economy is sometimes used as the same as market economy. Nobel Prize in Economics winner Ludwig von Mises said that a market economy is still a market economy even if the government joins in pricing.

In a market economy, the following will be true:

[[Symphony No.8 "Symphony of a Thousand" (Mahler)]]

CATEGORIES: Symphonies, Compositions by Gustav Mahler, Faust

Symphony No. 8 in E-flat major by Gustav Mahler (1860–1911) is one of the largest choral works in classical music.  It needs a huge orchestra to play it and a huge choir to sing.  Because so many performers are needed it is often called  "Symphony of a Thousand", but that is not a name that Mahler gave to it.

Mahler worked very hard at it, composing it in quite a short time at Maiernigg in southern Austria in the summer of 1906.  It was the last of Mahler's works that was to be given its first performance in his lifetime.  The symphony was given its first performance in Munich on 12 September 1910.

Symphonies are usually pieces of music played just by an orchestra, but Beethoven started a tradition of having singing in symphonies: his Ninth Symphony is the famous one with the Ode to Joy in the last movement.  Mahler took up this idea of combining singing with symphony.  His Symphonies Nos 2, 3, and 4 all have singing in them.  The next three are just for orchestra, but in No. 8 he uses singing again.

Symphony No. 8 is very unusual because he does not have the usual three or four movements with traditional forms such as sonata form.  The whole symphony is in two parts.  Part I is based on the Latin text of a ninth-century Christian hymn for Pentecost, Veni creator spiritus ("Come, Creator Spirit").  Part II is in German.  The words come from the closing scene of Goethe's Faust. 

The two parts have a common idea: the idea of being saved through the power of love. Musically Mahler does this by sharing tunes throughout the symphony.  The symphony expresses the confidence of the eternal human spirit.

For many years after Mahler’s death it was not often performed.  It is, of course, a very expensive symphony to perform because of the vast numbers of musicians needed.  It also needs to be performed in a very large concert hall.  Today it is played more often.  The 100th anniversary of its first performance will be celebrated in July 2010in the opening concert of the BBC Proms is the Royal Albert Hall, London.

Opinions about the symphony have been divided.  Some people did not think the optimism expressed in the music was really convincing.  Other people have said it is one of the greatest musical expressions of humanity.

[[Minos]]

CATEGORIES: People in Greek mythology

Minos was the mythical first king of Crete,  son of Zeus and Europa.  The following stories are mythological, and have no real historical basis.

Every nine years, he made King Aegeus pick seven young boys and seven young girls to be sent to Daedalus' creation, the labyrinth, to be eaten by the Minotaur. After his death, Minos became a judge of the dead in the underworld. 

He once had a wife named Pasophae. Minos upset the Greek gods by cheating them in a sacrifice. He told Poseidon that he would sacrifice a beautiful bull that Poseidon gave him after he used it. Instead, he switched it with another bull. They punished him by having Pasophae fall in love with a bull.

Pasophae asked Daedalus to help her, so Daedalus made a mechanical cow for her, and she got into it. The bull mated with the wooden cow and Pasophae had a child. It was the Minotaur, half human, half bull. 

King Minos took the Minotaur and put it in a labrynth, or maze, built by Daedalus.  When he was in possession of all of Crete he ordered that fourteen young people come to him to be sacrificed to the Minotaur.  Theseus volunteered to be one of them, and went there with daughter, Ariadne. He killed the Minotaur in the labyrinth.

The Minoan civilization was later named after him by Arthur Evans. Evans was the archaeologist who discovered and excavated the palace of Knossos in Crete.

[[Daedalus]]

CATEGORIES: People in Greek mythology

Daedalus was King Minos' head architect in ancient Greece and son of Athena.  When King Minos of Crete was having some sovereignty problems, he asked Poseidon, god of the sea, for an offering to sacrifice to him as a sign as true kingship.  So Poseidon sent a snow-white bull straight out of the sea foam.  Once the people of Crete saw the bull, they all agreed that it was a sign of true kingship.  However, once King Minos saw the bull, he refused to sacrifice the bull, kept it for himself, and sacrificed another bull to Poseidon, thus angering him.  Poseidon put a curse on Minos’ wife, making her fall in love with the bull.  She loved it so much that she wanted to mate with it.  Minos called for the help of Daedalus, who built a wooden bull and put Queen Pasiphae inside it, thus calming her anxiety for mating with the bull.  She soon became pregnant with half-man, half-bull (also called the Minotaur).  

King Minos was horrified and asked Daedalus to build some kind of prison to keep the Minotaur from destroying Crete.  So Daedalus built a labyrinth that was so complicated that the Minotaur could not get out.  Only Daedalus knew the course of the labyrinth.  Minos was afraid that Daedalus would tell the route through the labyrinth, and that he would tell that the Minotaur was the son of Minos' wife, he imprisoned Daedalus and his son Icarus, in a high tower.  Daedalus made some wings that he strapped to his and Icarus’ arms and together they escaped from the tower.  However, Icarus, forgetting his father’s words, flew too close to the sun, and the wax that held the feathers together melted.  Icarus fell into the ocean and drowned.  Daedalus landed safely on an island, and in grief, he named the sea that he and Icarus had flown across the Icarian Sea.

While most cat fanciers love the flat faced Persian, this brings along many illnesses. The public likes the traditional faced Persian more than the flat faced one. They can get polycystic kidney disease easily.

The gentle and easy-going nature of the Persian makes it very easy to live in apartments with this cat. While it is the top cat in the U.S.A, it's popularity has decreased in France and the U.K.

Persian cats are not an ordinary cat,they can barely live outside in the wild.

Pentateuch means the first five books of the Bible. These books are Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy.  The word Pentateuch comes from two Greek words that mean "five books" or "five scroll" 

According to tradition, the books were written by the Israelite leader, Moses. The Pentateuch is often called the Five Books of Moses or the Torah.

The Pentateuch tells the story from the Creation of the world to the death of Moses and the preparation of the Israelite's to enter the land of Canaan.  The story is told in three parts.  The first part (Genesis 1-11) is about the Creation and the beginning of human beings on earth.  The second part (Genesis 12-50) are the stories of the ancestors of the Israelites, mainly Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph. The third part, beginning with the book of Exodus, describes how the Israelite's left Egypt and the early history of the people of Israel as a nation. It also has many laws about how the Israelite's must build their society. Deuteronomy is mostly Moses's final speech to his people and a summary of the Pentateuch.

The Pentateuch is most likely the oldest part of the Bible, however there is speculation that the book of Job could be older due to the similarities of Job to the patriarchal period, ie counting wealth in flocks and the sacrifices being performed by the patriarch of the household rather than a priest. Scholars do not know exactly when these books were writtenSeptember 2018 however many place Moses at between 1,600 - 1,450 BC. The earliest parts may have been written more than 1,000 years before the final partsSeptember 2018 according to the Julius Wellhausen 4 JEDP theory. However this theory is based on the idea that the Pentateuch is a disjointed work and has received due criticism. Modern archaeological discoveries suggest that some of the oldest stories in Genesis may date back three thousand years.September 2018

[[Quickstep]]

CATEGORIES: Ballroom dances

The Quickstep is an International Style ballroom dance that follows a 4/4  time beat, at about 50 bars per minute.p62 From its early beginning as a faster Foxtrot, the Quickstep has become quite different. It is danced to the fastest tempo of the ballroom dances.

The Quickstep developed in the 1920s from a combination of the Foxtrot, the Charleston, and other dances. The dance is English in origin, and was standardized in 1927. Although it came from the Foxtrot, the Quickstep now is quite separate. Unlike the modern Foxtrot, the feet often close and syncopated (split-beat) steps occur often. Three characteristic dance figures of the Quickstep are the chassés, where the feet come together, the quarter turns, and the lock step.p126

This dance became a very dynamic one with a lot of movement on the dance floor, with many advanced patterns including hops, runs, quick steps with a lot of momentum, and rotation. The tempo of Quickstep dance is rather brisk as it was developed to ragtime era jazz music which was fast-paced compared to other dance music.

Today the complexity of Quickstep as done by competition dancers has increased. They use more syncopated steps. While in older times quickstep patterns were counted with "quick" (one beat) and "slow" (two beats) steps, many advanced patterns today are cued with split beats, such as "quick-and-quick-and-quick, quick, slow", with there being further steps on the 'and's.

[[Waltz (International)]]

CATEGORIES: Ballroom dances

The Waltz is one of the five international ballroom dances in the Modern or Standard style. It is danced socially, and in ballroom competitions. Like its older brother, the Viennese waltz, this dance originated in Vienna, but was greatly modified by English dance teachers in the 1920s. That is why it is sometimes called the English waltz. Other names are the diagonal waltz, the international waltz, and the slow waltz.

Music for the waltz should be in 3/4 time, and played at 29 to 34 bars per minute.p62 The accent is on the first beat of each bar. For beginners it is a simple dance compared to some others. At competitive level it is much more demanding. It features whisks, chassés, spins, hesitations, drags, and split-beat steps, many of which have been copied in other dances. The first 'advanced' figure to be invented was the double reverse spin, by Maxwell Stewart in the 1924 World Championship.p42 Nowadays it is taught at the silver medal stage.

[[Tracking (education)]]

CATEGORIES: Education

Tracking is the method of placing students according to their ability level in homogeneous classes or learning experiences. Students of different abilities (low, middle, and high) are assigned to different "tracks" of courses and programs (vocational, general, college-bound, honors, and AP). Tracking is the term given to this process, and while some teachers believe that tracking makes instruction more manageable, others believe that it is a terribly flawed system. Once a student is placed, it may be very difficult to move up from one track to another.  The placements may reflect racism, classism, or sexism. Many educators charge that the United States relies more on tracking than any other nation in the world. Most schools today work hard to avoid using the term "tracking." Middle and high schools are taking their cue from elementary schools, where "ability grouping" has been in favor.  Ability grouping sorts students based on capability, but the groupings may well vary by subject.  While tracks suggest permanence, ability grouping is more transitory.  One year, a student might find herself in a high-ability math group and a low-ability English group.  The following year, that same student might be reassigned to a new set of groups. School tracking is a reality functioning under an assumed identity called ability grouping.

Arthur Murray (born Moses Teichman, April 4, 1895 –  March 3, 1991) was an American dance instructor and businessman, whose name is most often associated with the dance studio chain which bears his name.

Arthur Murray was born in Galicia, Austria-Hungary, in 1895 as Moses Teichman. In August 1897, he was brought to America by his mother Sarah on the S.S. Friesland, and landed at Ellis Island. They settled in Ludlow Street, in the Lower East Side of Manhattan with his father, Abraham Teichmann.

In 1912, at the age of 17, he taught dance at night while working as a draftsman by day. He studied under the popular dance team of Vernon and Irene Castle and went to work for them.

Murray won his first dance contest at the Grand Central Palace, a public dance hall. He later became a part-time dance teacher there, after graduation from high school. The first prize had been a silver cup, but Murray went home with nothing to show for his win. His partner of the evening took it; it was destined for a pawnshop. This loss made an impression on Murray, and in later years every winner in his dance contests took home a prize.

[[Occupational Safety and Health]]

CATEGORIES: Social sciences, Health

Occupational Safety and Health is a set of laws that have been made to protect the health and the safety of people when they are working.  Health and safety rules will vary a lot from one country to another.  Some countries have very strict rules.  Rules about Health and Safety have been made since 1950 when the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the World Health Organization (WHO) agreed about standards of health in the workplace.

Health and safety laws will deal with such things as: the temperature in the workplace (it must not be too hot or too cold), things on the floor that people could fall over, or things that could catch on their clothing and cause an accident, smoking in the workplace and other things that might cause pollution or which might be fire hazards, how many toilets per person there should be, whether they need safety equipment (e.g. hard hats in case anything falls on their heads), whether it is safe for a person to be left alone in the workplace, the rights of disabled people, how many hours in the day people can work for etc.

Businesses that do not obey health and safety regulations may be punished (e.g. with a fine or forced to close), or they may be held responsible if there is an accident.

In the European Union, member states have authorities which make sure that people obey the health and safety laws.  In the UK, health and safety legislation is made by the Health and Safety Executive and local authorities (the local council) under the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974.

In the United States, the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 created both the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).

No one can ever be said to be absolutely safe, and employers have to fill in “risk assessments” (UK) or “hazard assessments” (USA) to show they have done everything they can to make things safe.

There are many names for bread rolls, especially in local versions of British English. These were named depending on how the dough was made and how the roll was cooked.

Bread rolls are common in Europe, mostly in Germany and Austria. They are also common in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, and very common in Canada. In Germany and Austria, there is a large variety of bread rolls, ranging from white rolls made with wheat flour, to dark rolls containing mostly rye flour. Many variants include spices, such as coriander and cumin, nuts, or seeds, such as sesame seeds, poppy seed or sunflower seeds.

CATEGORIES: Submachine guns

It was used by the German Military during World War 2. It fired 9mm bullets and had a 32-round magazine. The weapon could only fire in full-automatic fire, but since the weapon had such a slow rate of fire of 500 rounds per minute, it was possible to fire individual bullets. It was one of the first weapons made completely out of plastic and steel, making it both cheap and quick to make. The design was so good and so reliable that British soldiers would often ditch their own Sten sub-machine guns and use the MP-40 instead. This would not have been a big problem since both weapons fire the same type of bullet and clip.

There have been five revisions since it was first published in 1952. Each time, more mental disorders were added, although some have been removed and are no longer seen as mental disorders. An example of this is homosexuality. 

The manual was developed from systems for collecting census and psychiatric hospital statistics, and from a manual written by the US Army. A lot of changes were made to it in 1980. The last time it was greatly changed was the fourth edition ("DSM-IV"), published in 1994, but small changes to text were made in a 2000 version. The fifth edition ("DSM-5") was published May 2013.

[[Aryan race]]

CATEGORIES: Race, Nazism, Indo-European

The Aryan race is an idea that was formed in the 19th and early 20th century.  The term "Aryan" comes from the Rig Veda and is the name of an ancient group of people in ancient Persia and India, who spoke an Indo-European language. It has been used to describe people of Iranian and Indian descent, but there was no record of Aryans in European history. Later it was used for Germanic peoples because of new ideas about the Aryans.

The term Aryan comes from the ancient Sanskrit word ārya, which was a term used by Sanskrit speaking people to distinguish themselves from other races. The Iranians also used the terms, and the name Iran means "land of the Aryans". The idea of an Aryan race was first used as a category of people but was later used by occult movements such as Theosophy. It was also later used by Nazis and white supremacists in racist ways.

[[Keynesian economics]]

CATEGORIES: Economic theories

Keynesian economics (also called Keynesianism) describes the economics theories of John Maynard Keynes. Keynes wrote about his theories in his book The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money. The book was published in 1936.

Keynes said capitalism is a good economic system. In a capitalist system, people earn money from their work. Businesses employ and pay people to work. Then people can spend their money on things they want. Other people work and make things to buy. Sometimes the capitalist system has problems. People lose their work. Businesses close. People cannot work and cannot spend money. Keynes said the government should step in and help people who do not have work.

This idea is called "demand-side policy". If people are working, the economy is good. If people are not working, the economy is bad.

Keynes said when the economy is bad, people want to save their money. That is, they do not spend their money on, or invest in, things they want. As a result, there is less economic activity. 

Keynes said the government should spend more money when people do not have work. The government can borrow money and give people jobs (work). Then people can spend money again and buy things. This helps other people find work.

Some people, such as conservatives, libertarians, and people who believe in Austrian economics, do not agree with Keynes' ideas. They say government work does not help capitalism. They say when the government borrows money, it takes money away from businesses. They do not like Keynesian economics because they say the economy can get better without government help.

During the late 1970s, Keynesian economics became less popular because inflation was high at the same time that unemployment was high. This is because many people interpreted Keynesian theory to say that it was impossible for there to be both high inflation and high unemployment. 

When a big recession happened in 2007, Keynesian economics became more popular. Leaders around the world (including Barack Obama) created stimulus packages which would allow their government to spend a lot of money to create jobs. Conservatives and Libertarians would say that the stimulus package rewards the bad behavior that lead to the recession. It tells big banks that they can misbehave and the government will step in and get them out of trouble.

[[Dental braces]]

CATEGORIES: Orthodontics

Dental braces are wires that are held together by brackets glued to the permanent teeth. The wires and brackets may be made of metal or other materials. Each week or month (or other time the orthodontist decides) the braces may be checked, cleaned, or changed into a tighter wire. 

Braces are an orthodontic device. They are to make the teeth straight, and to correct problems in a person's bite. There are many natural problems which occur to the way teeth fit together, but not everyone needs or will need braces. 

However, the use of braces is quite common, even when they are not medically necessary. Their cosmetic use for young females is more common in countries with first world economies. To overcome the visibility of traditional metal braces, there are now nearly transparent braces. Sometimes braces are possible behind the teeth, and so are not in view.

[[Braces]]

CATEGORIES: Accessories

Braces (suspenders in the U.S.) are a standard item of male clothing. Their function is to keep trousers at a set height on the body. They are standard wear for formal styles of dress such as the lounge suit.

There is also a fashion use among some young males, and a use by some workmen, most often with newspaper. Braces can be worn entirely out of sight, hidden by a waistcoat, or in sight as a display. A critical factor in formal dress is the "drop" of the trousers as they meet the shoes. Here braces avoid the need to hitch trousers up, always a problem with belts.

In many countries braces were worn by all classes of men for well over a hundred years until about the 1960s, except in the armed forces. Then fashion changed and men's clothes became informal, with lower waistlines and belts. Now they are a minority item.

[[The Flash]]

CATEGORIES: DC Comics superheroes, Comic books

The Flash (or simply Flash) is the name of several popular comic book characters from the DC Comics universe. Nicknamed the "Scarlet Speedster", all versions of the Flash who have the ability to travel at a very high speed, use superhuman reflexes and defy the laws of physics. The original Flash first appeared in Flash Comics #1 (cover date January 1940 / release month November 1939). This fictional character was created by writer Gardner Fox and Harry Lampert.

Thus far, at least four different characters—each of whom somehow gained the power of the "Speed Force"—have assumed the role of the Flash in DC's history: College athlete Jay Garrick (1940–1951, 1961–2011, 2017–present) was the first character to take on the alter-ego "The Flash", other characters who have been the  Flash are forensic scientist Barry Allen (1956–1985, 2008–present), Barry's brother-in-law Wally West (1986–2011, 2016–present) who is currently the youngest Flash, he calls himself "Kid Flash"; and Barry's grandson Bart Allen (2006–2007) who becomes "Impulse", the second hero known as Kid Flash. Each version of the Flash has been a key member of at least one of DC's premier teams: the Justice Society of America, the Justice League, and the Teen Titans. Most of the Flash stories take place in the fictional city of Central City.

The Flash is one of DC Comics' most popular characters and has been integral to the publisher's many reality-changing "crisis" storylines over the years. The original meeting of the Golden Age Flash Jay Garrick and Silver Age Flash Barry Allen in "Flash of Two Worlds" (1961) introduced the Multiverse storytelling concept to DC readers, which would become the basis for many DC stories in the years to come.

[[Damselfly]]

CATEGORIES: Odonata

Damselflies are insects in the order Odonata. They are similar to dragonflies, but are in a separate suborder, the Zygoptera. There are 20 families of damselfly. "Demoiselle" is another name for damselflies.

The wings of most damselflies are held along, and parallel to, the body when at rest. There are also damselfly families in which the wings are held open, as in the true dragonflies (Anisoptera). 

Damselflies are also usually smaller, weaker fliers than dragonflies.  Their eyes are well separated by more than their own diameter. Another distinction is that their forewings and hindwings look similar; this is not the case in the true dragonflies. Like dragonflies, damselflies cannot walk, but only land. Their life cycle is also similar. They have incomplete metamorphosis, with an aquatic nymph. The nymph is carnivorous, as is the adult.

Damselflies have existed since the later Carboniferous (early forms may be put in the Protozygoptera by some authorities). They are found on every continent except Antarctica. One feature of their life is different from dragonflies. Not only do their nymphs grow in rivers, but the adults usually keep close to the river, and live in colourful little groups. Most damselflies live their lives within a short distance of where they were hatched.

They are often brilliantly coloured, but when they land on a bush, out of direct sunlight, they are not easy to see. They land and close their wings at the same instant. They have eyes which detect movement well, and they fly off if anything moves nearby. Thus, although they are fragile and highly coloured, they are not easily caught by predators.

All damselflies are predatory; both nymphs and adults eat other insects.

The red pigment of some species is an intracellular protection against excessive visual light and ultraviolet radiation of the sun, which otherwise can cause photoinhibition of photosynthesis or mutations. Without it, the algae at the surface would suffer chromosome breaks and DNA mutations.

There are also ice algal communities on sea ice. These algae (mainly diatoms) are important in polar ecosystems (especially Antarctica) because they provide food for krill. Krill scrape off the algae from the underside of the ice, which is colored brown by the algae. The algae may be found between ice crystals or attached to them, in the water or saltwater channels between ice crystals.

John Deere (February 7, 1804 – May 17, 1886) was an American blacksmith and inventor. He started Deere & Company, which is a big company that makes farm equipment. In 1837, he invented the first successful steel plow. This worked better with the tough soil of the Midwestern United States.

John Deere was born in Rutland, Vermont, on February 7, 1804. He was the third son of William Rinold Deere and Sarah Yates Deere. In 1805, the family moved to Middlebury, Vermont, John’s father worked as a tailor. In 1808, William took a boat to England, because he hoped to claim an inheritance and make a more comfortable life for his family. He was never heard from again, and people think that he must have died at sea. John’s mother, Sarah, only had a small of money to raise him. John Deere's education was limited to the elementary schools of Vermont. At the age of 17 he learned how to be a blacksmith, which took him to several places in Vermont.

In 1836, John traveled to Grand Detour, Illinois, to make a fresh start. He had married and nine young children to look after. John was smart and hard working and he easily found work as a blacksmith. There were lots of farmers in Illinois and John had to fix their plows. The new farmers in Illinois struggled to turn heavy, sticky prairie soil with cast iron plows designed for the light, sandy soil of Vermont. John thought about the steel needles he had seen in father’s tailor shop. The needles stayed smooth and shiny because they were pulled through rough leather. John Deere came up with the idea for a plow that would work. The plow in his mind was polished and shiny and made of steel just like his father’s tailoring needles. It was shaped so that it could scour itself as it cut furrows. In 1837, he created his plow using a broken saw blade.

John sold his first plow to a farmer named Lewis Crandall. Lewis loved the plow told lots of other farmers. By 1841, John was making 100 of the plows every year. In 1843, he started working with another man named Leonard Andrus to help him keep up! By 1848, John had stopped working with Leonard and moved the business to Moline, Illinois. Moline had water power, coal and cheaper transportation than in Grand Detour. In 1850, John’s company made 1600 plows. The company was soon producing other tools to go with the steel plow.

In 1858, John asked his son Charles to be in charge of the company. John stayed on as president of the company, but he also wanted to work on others things. He started a bank in Moline and joined a church. He was also the mayor of the city for two years and the director of the city library! John Deere died on May 17, 1886, at his home in Moline.

[[Quena]]

CATEGORIES: Flutes, South American culture, World music

The quena, also written as "kena" in English, is the traditional flute of Peru and the Andes. Made of bamboo, it has six finger holes and one thumb hole and is open on both ends. To make a sound, the player closes the top end of the pipe with the flesh between the chin and lower lip, and blows a stream of air downward, over a notch cut into the end. It is normally in the key of G major. G is the lowest note when all the holes are covered. It produces a very breathy or airy tone.

The quenacho (also "kenacho" in English) is a bigger, lower sounding type of quena and made the same way. It is in the key of D major, a fourth lower than the quena. In most of Andes' towns "vamos a ir a la quena" (we will go to the quena) was used to threaten little children, because the quena was made of bamboo, a hard material.

Quena is mostly used in traditional Andean music. In the 1960s and 1970s the quena was used by several Nueva Canción musicians. Some groups such as Illapu have used it regularly. In the 1980s and 1990s some post-Nueva Canción rock groups have also used the quena in some of their songs; notably Soda Stereo in Cuando Pase el Temblor and Los Enanitos Verdes in Lamento Boliviano. The quena is also relatively common in World music.

Lee Harvey Oswald (October 18, 1939 – November 24, 1963) was, according to five government investigations, the sniper who assassinated U.S. President John F. Kennedy in Dallas, Texas on November 22, 1963.

A former U.S. Marine who lived in the Soviet Union for almost 3 years, Oswald was first arrested for the murder of police officer J. D. Tippit (1924-1963), who had been shot on a Dallas street shortly after Kennedy was killed. He was also soon suspected in the death of Kennedy as well.

Soon after he was arrested, Oswald talked to reporters in a hallway. Oswald shouted, "I didn't shoot anybody," and, "They've taken me in because of the fact that I lived in the Soviet Union. I'm just a patsy!" (a scapegoat or someone who is blamed for something someone else actually did). Later, at a press meeting, a reporter asked, "Did you kill the President?" and Oswald answered, "No, I have not been charged with that. In fact, nobody has said that to me yet. The first thing I heard about it was when the newspaper reporters in the hall asked me that question." As he was led from the room the question was called out, "What did you do in Russia?" and, "How did you hurt your eye?"; Oswald answered, "A policeman hit me."

Two days later, while being moved from police headquarters to the county jail, Oswald was shot and mortally wounded by nightclub owner Jack Ruby, in full view of television cameras broadcasting live.

[[Zangalewa]]

CATEGORIES: 1986 songs

"Zangaléwa" or "Tsaminamina" is a 1986 hit song, originally sung by a makossa group from Cameroon called Golden Sounds who were popular throughout Africa for their silly dances and costumes. The song was such a hit for Golden Sounds that they eventually changed their name to Zangaléwa, too. The song pays tribute to African skirmishers (a.k.a tirailleurs) during WW2. Most of the band members were in the Cameroonian Army themselves and used make up, fake belly and fake butt for comic relief.

The song is still used today almost everywhere in Africa by soldiers, policemen, boy scouts, sportsmen and their supporters, usually during training or for rallying. It is also widely used in schools throughout the continent especially in Cameroon as a marching song and the lyrics are well-known among Cameroonians. The song was also popular in Colombia where it was known as “The Military” and brought to the country by West African DJs.

The men in the group often dressed in military uniforms, wearing pith helmets and stuffing their clothes with pillows to appear like they had a swollen buttocks from riding the train and overweight stomachs from eating too much. Music historians say the song, or at least part of it, is a criticism of Black military officers who were in league with Whites to oppress their own people. The rest is Cameroonian slang and jargon from the soldiers during the war.

[[History of ancient Israel and Judah]]

CATEGORIES: Ancient Israel and Judah

Israel and Judah were Iron Age kingdoms of the old Near East. The area of time covered in this page is from the first mention of the name Israel in the archaeological record (1200 BCE) to the end of a independent Judean kingdom near the time of Jesus Christ.

The two kingdoms arose on the most eastern coast of the Mediterranean, the most western part of the Fertile Crescent, between the old empires of Egypt to the south, Assyria, Babylonia, later Persia to the north and east, Greece and later Rome across the sea to the west. The area is small, maybe only 100 miles north to south and 40 or 50 miles east to west.

Israel and Judah were from the Canaanite culture of the late Bronze Age, and were based on villages that formed and grew in the southern Levant highlands (today for the region between the coastal plain and the Jordan Valley) between c. 1200-1000 BCE. Israel became an important local power in the 9th and 8th centuries BCE before falling to the Assyrians.  The southern kingdom, Judah, became rich inside the greater empires of the region before a revolt against Babylon led to it being destroyed early in the 6th century.

Judean exiles returned from Babylon early in the following Persian period, starting a Judahite presence in the province of Yehud, as Judah was now called. Yehud was absorbed into the subsequent Greek-ruled kingdoms which followed the conquests of Alexander the Great. In the 2nd century BC, the Jews went up against Greek rule and created the Hasmonean kingdom, which became first a Roman dependency and soon went under the rule of the Roman Empire.

[[Endeavour River]]

CATEGORIES: Rivers of Queensland

The Endeavour River on Cape York Peninsula in north Queensland, Australia, was named in 1770 by the English explorer, Captain James Cook. He had been forced to put his ship, HM Bark Endeavour, onto the beach at the river mouth so that it could be repaired. The ship had been damaged by coral on the Great Barrier Reef. The Aboriginal Australians, the Guugu Yimithirr people, called the river Wabalumbaal. 

Cook and his crew stayed for seven weeks and met with the Guugu Yimithirr. The word "kangaroo" was a Guugu Yimithirr word for the animal which Cook wrote down in his diary. The naturalists Joseph Banks and Daniel Solander made big collections of native plants and flowers, while Sydney Parkinson made pictures of the flora and fauna of the region. 

The Endeavour River is very wide at its mouth where it meets the sea. Upstream it quickly branches into many small creeks. There are 25 species of mangrove grwoing along the river. Saltwater crocodiles live in the river, and can often be seen on the banks during the winter in June and July. In October 2008, a man fishing for crabs on the river bank was taken by a crocodile. At first people thought it was a big crocodile, more than six metres in length. But his remains were later found inside a 4.5 crocodile. The river is also a good place to go fishing for barramundi. 

In recent years, tilapia fish, which are a "noxious  species" in Australia, have moved into the river in large numbers. Scientists are worried that this will harm the numbers of native fish. These fish, which are often farmed for food in other countries, are listed in the worst 100 introduced species. A person in Australia owning or selling a tilapia could be fined up to AU$11,000.

There is now a town, Cooktown, at the mouth of the Endeavour River. About 2000 people live in the town. Cooktown is the northernmost town on the east coast of Australia. It was first settled in 1873, at the site of Cook's landing. It was a port for the newly discovered Palmer River Goldfields. Some of the relatively undisturbed natural features near the mouth of the river have been protected as a Queensland National Park, the Endeavour River National Park.

The chapter is formed of three independent narratives, which place the culture-hero Daniel at the court of Cyrus, king of the Persians: "When King Astyages was laid to rest with his ancestors, Cyrus the Persian succeeded to his kingdom."  There Daniel "was a companion of the king, and was the most honored of all his Friends" (14:1).

The narrative of Bel (14:1–22) is a folk tale ridiculing worship. In it, the king asks Daniel "Do you not think that Bel is a living god? Do you not see how much he eats and drinks every day?" Daniel proves through a ruse that the sacred meal of Bel is actually consumed at night by the seventy priests and their wives and children, who entered through a secret door when the temple's doors were sealed. The priests and their wives and children are killed, and Daniel is permitted to destroy the idol of Bel and the temple.  This version has been cited as an ancestor of the "locked room mystery".  

In the brief companion narrative of the Dragon (14:23–30), "there was a great dragon, which the Babylonians revered." In this case the supposed god is no idol, but not all that eats is divine: Daniel slew the dragon by making cakes of pitch, fat and hair. The dragon ate them and burst open. Now the Babylonians were indignant. "The king has become a Jew; he has destroyed Bel, and killed the dragon, and slaughtered the priests," they said, and demanded that Daniel be handed over to them.

The third narrative (14:31–42), Daniel in the Lions' Den, is apparently Daniel's 1st or 2nd trip. It has been made into a consequence of the preceding episode, but the Septuagint precedes it with the notice: "From the prophecy of Habakkuk, son of Jesus, of the tribe of Levi." Daniel remained unharmed in the den with seven lions, fed by the miraculous transportation of the prophet Habakkuk. "On the seventh day the king came to mourn for Daniel. When he came to the den he looked in, and there sat Daniel! The king shouted with a loud voice, "You are great, O Lord, the God of Daniel, and there is no other besides you!" Then he pulled Daniel out, and threw into the den those who had attempted his destruction, and they were instantly eaten before his eyes." Some have suggested that the Daniel in Bel and the Dragon is different from that of Daniel 1-13.

[[South Lebanon conflict]]

CATEGORIES: Middle East, Conflicts

The South Lebanon conflict describes a series of military clashes in South Lebanon involving Israel, Palestine Liberation Organization, Lebanese factions and Syria.

The conflict began in late 1960s and escalated in the 1970s. After the PLO leadership and its Fatah brigade were expelled from Jordan in 1971 for fomenting a revolt, they entered Lebanon and internal and cross-border violence increased. The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) had already recruited militants in Lebanon from among the families of Palestinian refugees who were expelled or fled due to the creation of Israel in 1948. By 1968, the PLO and Israel were committing cross border attacks against each other. Meanwhile, demographic tensions over the Lebanese National Pact led to the Lebanese Civil War (1975–1990). PLO was one of the key factors to the eruption of the Lebanese Civil War and its bitter battles with Lebanese factions caused foreign intervention. Israel's 1978 invasion of Lebanon pushed the PLO north of the Litani River, but the PLO continued their campaign against Israel. Israel invaded Lebanon again in 1982, in alliance with major Lebanese Christian militias, and forcibly expelled the PLO. Israel withdrew to a slim borderland buffer zone, held with the aid of proxy militants in the South Lebanon Army (SLA). Israel and Lebanon signed the May 17 Agreement providing a framework for the establishment of normal bilateral relations between the two countries, but relations were disrupted with takeover of Shia and Druze militias in early 1984.

In 1985, a Lebanese Shi'te resistance movement sponsored by Iran, calling itself Hezbollah, called for armed struggle to "end the Israel occupation of Lebanese territory". When the Lebanese civil war ended and other warring factions agreed to disarm, Hezbollah and the SLA refused. Combat with Hezbollah weakened Israeli resolve and led to a collapse of the SLA and an Israeli withdrawal in 2000 to their side of the UN designated border. Citing Israeli control of the Shebaa farms territory, Hezbollah continued cross border attacks intermittently over the next six years. Hezbollah now sought freedom for Lebanese citizens in Israeli prisons and successfully used the tactic of capturing Israeli soldiers as leverage for a prisoner exchange in 2004. The capturing of two Israeli soldiers by Hezbollah ignited the 2006 Lebanon War. Its ceasefire called for the disarmament of Hezbollah and the remaining armed camps of the PLO, and for Lebanon to control its southern border militarily for the first time in four decades.

Hostilities were suspended on 8 September 2006. As of 2009 Hezbollah had not disarmed. On 18 June 2008, Israel declared that it was open to peace talks with Lebanon.

[[Arab–Israeli conflict]]

CATEGORIES: Arab–Israeli conflict

The Arab–Israeli conflict  is a term used to describe the political tensions and open hostilities between the Arab countries of the Middle East and North Africa and the State of Israel. The conflict has gone on since 1948.

The Arab–Israeli conflict began from earlier tensions between the Arab and Jewish communities in British Mandatory Palestine, with the rise of two nationalist movements - Zionist movement among Jews and Arab nationalism among the Arabs.  The ethnic conflict in Mandatory Palestine was also a result of the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, which created tension over the division and ownership of the land.  While the Jewish people saw the land as their historical homeland of the Land of Israel, the Palestinian people and Pan-Arab movement saw the land as Palestine belonging to the Arabs and in the Pan-Islamic context, as territory regarded as Muslim lands.

The modern conflict started with the 1948 Arab-Israeli war in parallel with the creation of state of Israel by the Jews. Later, on the course of the 1948 War, the All-Palestine Government was created in Gaza Strip by the Arab League, as an Arab Palestinian state.  Israel won the 1948 war, and the All-Palestine Government moved to Cairo in Egypt and were not allowed to return to Gaza.  They gradually lost importance, until abolished in 1959 by the Egyptian President Nasser.

In 1964, another Palestinian political organization was formed by Yasser Arafat (named Palestinian Liberation Organization), and became the most important Palestinian movement. In 1967, Arab countries and Israel fought the Six-Day War, resulting in Israeli takeover of Gaza Strip and Sinai Peninsula from Egypt, West Bank from Jordan and Golan Heights from Syria.  Jordan, Egypt and PLO soon began a low-level War of Attrition, which lasted from 1967 to 1970 with no significant benefits to any side.  In 1973, another major war, the Yom Kippur War, was started by Egypt and Syria to regain the territory lost in the Six Day War.  Egypt liberated part of the Sinai, and Syria was pushed back to Damascus. Egypt and Israel both claimed victory and till now historians argue as to whom the victory belongs to.

Over the years, it has changed from the large-scale Arab–Israeli conflict to a more local Israeli-Palestinian conflict, though the Arab World and Israel still disagree with each other over specific territory.

[[Storms of My Grandchildren]]

CATEGORIES: Climate change, Non-fiction books, Environment

Storms of My Grandchildren is the first book written by climate scientist James Hansen.

Hansen says that the burning of fossil fuels is changing our climate and that the earth is in danger. Millions of species, and humanity itself, are threatened. The title of the book, Storms of My Grandchildren, refers to the extreme weather events "that will greet the next generation if the unmitigated use of fossil fuels continues".

Hansen states that we immediately need to "reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide to at most 350 ppm in order to avoid disasters for coming generations".   He says that we need to reduce coal plant emissions, and improve forestry and agricultural practices.

Storms of My Grandchildren has been reviewed in Nature, the Los Angeles Times, Science, and Cosmos.

James Hansen is director of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies and is often called the "father of global warming".

[[Star of Bethlehem]]

CATEGORIES: Gospels, Bethlehem, Astrology, Christian terminology

The Star of Bethlehem, also called the Christmas Star, is a star in the Bible and Christian tradition that let the Magi know that Jesus was born, and later helped them go to Bethlehem. According to the Gospel of Matthew, the star made the magi travel to Jerusalem. There they met King Herod of Judea, and asked where the king of the Jews had been born. Herod's advisors said that the Messiah would be born in Bethlehem, a nearby village, because of a prophecy in the Book of Micah. While the magi were going to Bethlehem, they saw the star again. The star stopped above the place where Jesus was born. There, the magi saw Jesus with his mother, worshipped him and gave costly presents to him. They then returned to their "own country".

Christians usually think of the star as a miraculous sign to show the birth of the Christ. Astronomers have thought of many different explanations for the star. A nova, a planet, a comet, an occultation, and a conjunction (planets coming together) have all been suggested.

Some scholars say that the story is not historically right and that the star was not real.

The Star of Bethlehem is a well-loved subject at planetarium shows during Christmas, but the Bible seems to suggest that the magi visited Jesus at least several months after he was born. The visit is usually celebrated on Epiphany (January 6) in Western Christianity and on Christmas (December 25) in Eastern Christianity.

[[List of Formula One World Championship points scoring systems]]

CATEGORIES: Formula One lists

This is a Formula One World Championship scoring system used by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). The FIA uses this system to decide the FIA World Drivers' and Constructors' Championships since the 1950 season. The Championships are awarded to the driver and constructor (car builder) who score the most points over the course of the season.

From 1950 through 1959, a championship point was awarded to the driver (and team starting in 1958) that set the fastest lap.

In some seasons, not all race results would be counted towards the World Championship. Only a certain number of a driver's best results would count. In 1988 this caused a very unusual result. Alain Prost and Ayrton Senna were the drivers for McLaren. They were the best two drivers of that year. There were 16 races that year, but only the best 11 results counted towards the championship. Prost won seven races and finished seven races in second place. He scored a total of 105 points, but only 87 of them counted for the championship. Senna won eight races and finished second in three, giving him 90 points for the championship and 94 for the season. This resulted in the strange event where Prost took a record number of points, yet Senna won the champion. A new system counting all races was introduced in 1991. One additional point was also awarded to the race winner.

The current system was introduced for the 2010 season. It was designed to allow more teams and drivers to score points. 

The most dominant Drivers' Champion in terms of points scored is Jim Clark. Clark scored the maximum of 54 points (6 wins) in both 1963 and 1965. In recent years, Michael Schumacher finished on the podium (one of the top three finishers) in every race of the 2002 season. Schumacher scored 144 of a maximum 170 points. The most dominant Constructors' Champion in recent times was McLaren in 1988. McLaren scored 199 of a maximum 240 points available. McLaren finished 134 points ahead of the second place team. In 2002, Ferrari scored 221 points of a maximum 340 points available. Ferrari finished 129 points ahead of the second place team.

[[2007 Formula One espionage controversy]]

CATEGORIES: Formula One, Espionage

The 2007 Formula One espionage controversy, also known as "Spygate," or "Stepneygate" involves claim that the teams passed confidential technical information. It was claimed that McLaren Formula One had information from the Ferrari team. Then it was claimed that Renault F1 had information from the McLaren team.

The case involved Nigel Stepney, who used to work for Ferrari and was working at the time for McLaren. It also included Mike Coughlan, who was working for McLaren and his wife Trudy Coughlan. Ferrari claimed that Stepney stole confidential technical information. This became the subject of legal action in Italy and an FIA investigation. The case in England was dropped after Ferrari reached an agreement with the Coughlans.

The FIA penalized McLaren. The biggest penalty was that McLaren excluded (not allowed to compete) from the 2007 Constructors' Championship. They were also fined a record-breaking $100 million (USD).

Then the FIA claimed Renault F1 had information about the 2006 and 2007 McLaren cars. Renault were found guilty of breaking the same regulation as McLaren, but Renault was not punished.

[[Oxidation state]]

CATEGORIES: Chemical bonding, Oxides

The oxidation state (or oxidation number) of an element is used to predict what sort of chemical compounds form.

For example, if you put hydrogen and oxygen together, they form H2O, and not H3O because the oxidation number of oxygen is −2, which means that we need two +1 hydrogens for the numbers to balance.

You can look up the oxidation state(s) of an element on many periodic tables. They are usually between −2 and +3.

Oxidation states were invented by Antoine Lavoisier to predict how oxygen reacted in chemical reactions; hence the name. Later on, we learned that Lavoisier's theory can be used to predict other reactions too, many of them have nothing to do with oxygen.

In ionic compounds, oxidation states tell us about the movement of charge within the compound. For example, chlorine has a very high electronegativity which means that it really likes electrons and sodium has a very low electronegativity which means that it really hates electrons. When sodium and chlorine are close together, sodium will give away an electron to chlorine. A change in charge has taken place; chlorine's charge has gone down which we call reduction, and sodium's charge has gone up which we call oxidation.

[[Oxidizing agent]]

CATEGORIES: Physical chemistry

Oxidizing agent can have two meanings. It can be a chemical that releases oxygen atoms. For example, potassium chlorate has a chemical formula of KClO3. When it oxidizes a reducing agent, such as powdered aluminium metal, it loses its oxygen to the aluminium and becomes potassium chloride, KCl. 

Another definition is a chemical that accepts electrons from a reducing agent. For example, potassium permanganate has an oxidation state of +7. In an acid solution, it gains 5 electrons (e-). It becomes a manganese compound with an oxidation state of +2. Most oxidizing agents of the second definition have oxygen, but not all. For example, fluorine (F2) does not have any oxygen in it. It is also the most powerful oxidizing agent. When it acts as an oxidizing agent, it gains an electron to transfer from an oxidation state of 0 to an oxidation state of -1. 

[[Reducing agent]]

CATEGORIES: Chemistry

A reducing agent is a chemical that gives away electrons to another chemical compound, the oxidizing agent. For example, zinc is a reducing agent. When it reacts with an oxidizing agent, it gives up two electrons, changing its oxidation state from 0 to +2. All chemical elements have an oxidation state of 0.

[[Reduction (chemistry)]]

CATEGORIES: Chemistry

Reduction is a chemical reaction that involves the gaining of electrons by one of the atoms involved in the reaction between two chemicals. The term refers to the element that accepts electrons, as the oxidation state of the element that gains electrons is lowered. 

An example of a reduction is when iron reacts with oxygen, forming iron oxides such as those called rust.  The iron is oxidized and the oxygen is reduced. This is called redox. A blast furnace reverses that reaction, using carbon monoxide as a reducing agent to reduce the iron.

[[Electroplating]]

CATEGORIES: Technology, Physical chemistry

Electroplating is the coating of an object with a metal. It is done by immersing the object and a bar of the metal in a solution containing the metal ions. Electric current is then applied; the positive goes to the metal and the negative goes to the object. The metal bar dissolves in the solution and plates out on the object, forming a thin but durable coating of metal. It is often used to gold-plate objects for decoration or to stop corrosion. Normally the metal becomes fragile, and is only used for display.

CATEGORIES: Chlorine compounds, Calcium compounds

Calcium chloride is a chemical compound made of calcium and chlorine atoms. It has the formula of CaCl2. It absorbs water from the air and releases heat when it is dissolved in water. It is used as a de-icer on roads to melt the ice. It can be formed by mixture of calcium oxide with hydrochloric acid, but this produces a version that is hydrated (has water molecules attached to it). The anhydrous (no water molecules attached) form is needed most of the time. Calcium chloride is melted at a high temperature and electrolyzed to produce calcium metal.

On July 5, 2010, while boating on Lake St. Clair with his children, father-in-law, and mother-in-law, Probert experienced "severe chest pain" and collapsed. His father-in-law Dan Parkinson, the Cornwall, Ontario, chief of police, attempted CPR to save his life. He was taken to Windsor Regional Hospital's Metropolitan Campus and was pronounced dead. His funeral services were held July 9, 2010, in Windsor, Ontario. It was attended by many of his former teammates and rivals including Dino Ciccarelli, Tie Domi, Gerard Gallant, Doug Gilmour, Stu Grimson, Joey Kocur, Brad McCrimmon, Darren McCarty and Steve Yzerman, as well as the Red Wings general manager Ken Holland and owners Mike and Marian Ilitch. His eulogy was delivered by Yzerman. His brain was donated to the Sports Legacy Institute to help researchers that are studying the effects of concussions and other sports-related head injuries. In February 2011, the researchers announced at Boston University that they had found evidence of chronic traumatic encephalopathy in Probert's brain.

[[Laurasia]]

CATEGORIES: Laurasia

Laurasia  was a supercontinent. It had been the northern part of the Pangaea global supercontinent. Pangaea split into Laurasia and Gondwana to the south during the Jurassic period. 

Laurasia included most of the landmasses which make up today's continents of the northern hemisphere, chiefly Laurentia (the name given to the North American craton), Europe, Scandinavia, western Russia, Siberia, Kazakhstan, and China.

Laurasia's name combines the names of Laurentia and Eurasia.

Although Laurasia is known as a Mesozoic phenomenon, today it is believed that the same continents that formed Laurasia also existed as a coherent continent after the breakup of Rodinia around 1 billion years ago. To avoid confusion with Laurasia, that continent is referred to as Proto-Laurasia.

[[Sodium bicarbonate]]

CATEGORIES: Sodium compounds, Carbonates

Sodium bicarbonate is baking soda, bicarb or bicarbonate of soda. It is a chemical compound, sodium hydrogen carbonate, with the formula NaHCO3. The elements within it are sodium, hydrogen, carbon, oxygen. It is a white crystalline  powder. 

Sodium bicarbonate is an antacid. It is sometimes used to relieve acid indigestion, a sickness caused by lots of acid in one's stomach. This was usually done by mixing sodium bicarbonate with water and drinking it.  When there is too much acid, it causes heartburn, an uncomfortable feeling in the stomach. It reacts with acids to produce carbon dioxide gas. It also reacts with bases to reduce their harmful effects.

When sodium bicarbonate is heated, it releases carbon dioxide and water vapor (gas) and turns into sodium carbonate.

Baking soda is rarely found in the earth. It can be manufactured artificially, though. 

[[Heartburn]]

CATEGORIES: Symptoms, Digestive system

Heartburn is an uncomfortable feeling in the chest that happens when acids from the stomach travel up the esophagus (the tube leading from the mouth to the stomach). When stomach acids hurt the lining of the esophagus, the feeling is a symptom. 

The burning sensation is commonly called "heartburn," but it has nothing to do with the heart.

The symptom may be helped by taking antacids, such as calcium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate.

A Material safety data sheet, commonly abbreviated to MSDS, is a document for a chemical compound. It explains the hazards of the chemical and gives an overview of the chemical's properties. 

[[NFPA 704]]

CATEGORIES: Standards, Safety, Chemistry

NFPA 704, also known as a fire diamond, is a diamond-shaped sign or picture that tells people about the hazards of a chemical compound.  It was designed in 1960 by the National Fire Protection Association, as a way of quickly telling firefighters and other emergency workers what kind of dangers might be nearby.

The sign is made of four smaller diamonds: a red one on top, a yellow one on the right, a white one on the bottom, and a blue one on the left.  Numbers or symbols in these boxes tell how dangerous the chemical is.  

The red diamond tells how flammable the chemical compound is: how easily it catches fire.  The yellow diamond tells about reactivity: how quickly the compound reacts with other materials.  (For example, some chemicals, like ammonium nitrate, explode when they touch water; this is an example of reactivity.)  The blue diamond tells how dangerous the chemical is to a person's health.  Each of these three diamonds - red, yellow, and blue - are given a score between 0 and 4.  A score of 0 means there is no danger.  A score of 4 means there is the worst possible danger.

The white diamond has codes for "special hazards."  For example, if a chemical like ammonium nitrate should not touch water because it will explode, a W with a line through it will be written in the white diamond.

[[Fluorite]]

CATEGORIES: Minerals

Fluorite is the mineral form of calcium fluoride.  It has a chemical formula of CaF2  where Ca stands for calcium, and F2 stands for Fluorine.

Geologists have found about 9000 deposits of fluorite found on the Earth.  It is mainly mined in China, Mexico and Russia. 

[[Fluoride]]

CATEGORIES: Chemicals

Fluoride is the reduced form of fluorine. When fluorine gains an electron by taking it from another substance (oxidizing it), it converts into fluoride. Fluoride is found in toothpaste and helps prevent tooth decay. Fluoride is added artificially to drinking water in some places and has caused a controversy over the harmful effects versus the benefits of fluoridation.

[[Fluoridation]]

CATEGORIES: Chemistry

Fluoridation is the adding of fluorine compounds (fluorides) to various substances, especially toothpaste and drinking water.

[[Chromate]]

CATEGORIES: Chromium compounds

Chromate is an ion that contains one chromium atom (in its +6 oxidation state) and four oxide atoms. Its formula is CrO4. Its overall charge is -2. Dichromate is similar, but it contains two chromium atoms and seven oxide atoms (therefore, Cr2O7).

Chromate and dichromate are strongly oxidizing in acidic conditions, but weakly oxidizing in basic conditions. Chromates are generally bright yellow, while dichromates are generally orange or red. They can be made by reaction of chromium(III) oxide and a metal oxide in a basic environment. They can be destroyed by reaction with reducing agents. The oxygen in the air boosts the chromium atom's oxidation state from +3 to +6. 

Chromates and dichromates are harmful when powdered because the dust is carcinogenic (it can cause cancer). This can be avoided by reducing chromate with something like iron(II) sulfate.

[[Chromium(III) oxide]]

CATEGORIES: Chromium compounds, Oxides

Chromium(III) oxide is a dark green chemical that has a formula of Cr2O3. It is composed of chromium in its +3 oxidation state and oxide ions. It can react with other metal oxides in basic conditions to make chromates. It is made from chromium ore and is part of the process for making chromium metal. It was used as a pigment. It dissolves in acid to produce chromium(III) salts, such as chromium(III) chloride. Stainless steel's corrosion resistance is based on this compound. A thin layer of this compound forms on the surface of the stainless steel. It prevents the rest of the steel from oxidizing.

[[Chromium(III) chloride]]

CATEGORIES: Chlorine compounds, Chromium compounds

Chromium(III) chloride is a chemical compound composed of chromium in its +3 oxidation state and chloride ions. It is green when hydrated (attached to water molecules) and purple when anhydrous (not attached to water molecules).

A stink bomb is a packet that, when pressed, releases bad odors. A common ingredient in stink bombs is ammonium sulfide. They are used for practical jokes on other people. Some use it to imitate farting, and some use them to embarrass other people, by placing them in the seat of their pants. When the targeted person sits, the stink bomb releases bad odors, similar to menthol. Stink bombs do expire, since the longer they are not used the less effective they are. Stink bombs do have guides. Stink bombs are also lightly regulated, since some can have toxic waste inside. it is similar to an instant cold pack.

Household ammonia is a marketed substance that consists of a dilute solution of ammonia in water. About 7% of the solution by weight is ammonia. It is used for cleaning. It can also be known as ammonium hydroxide, but it really exists in the form NH3 + H2O rather than NH4+ + OH-.

[[Cape York Peninsula]]

CATEGORIES: Geography of Queensland, Peninsulas

Cape York Peninsula is a large remote peninsula in the far north of Queensland, Australia. It is the largest unspoilt wilderness in eastern Australia and one of the last remaining wilderness areas on Earth.  The area is mostly flat and about half is used for grazing cattle. Much of the wildlife is threatened by introduced species and weeds. However, the eucalyptus wooded savannah, tropical rainforests, and other types of habitat are now recognized as being globally important.

[[Crankshaft]]

CATEGORIES: Motors

The crankshaft, sometimes casually called the crank, is the part of an engine which changes the up and down motion of the pistons into rotation. To convert the motion, the crankshaft has one or more offset shafts. The pistons are connected to the crankshaft by these shafts. When the piston moves up and down, it pushes the offset shaft. This in turn rotates the crankshaft.

The pistons cause a pulsing affect in the rotation. A crankshaft usually connects to a flywheel. The flywheel smooths out the rotation. Sometimes there is a torsion or vibration damper on the other end of the crankshaft. This helps reduce vibrations of the crankshaft. 

Large engines usually have several cylinders. This helps to reduce pulsations from individual firing strokes. For some engines it is necessary to provide counterweights. The counterweight is used to offset the piston and improve balance. While counterweights add a lot of weight to the crankshaft, it provides a smoother running engine. This allows higher RPMs to be reached and more power produced.

[[Motorboat]]

CATEGORIES: Boats

A motorboat is a boat which is powered by an engine (also commonly called a motor). Some motorboats are made with inboard engines; others have an outboard motor installed on the outside, containing the internal combustion engine, the gearbox and the propeller in one portable unit.

An inboard/outboard contains a hybrid of a powerplant and an outboard, where the internal combustion engine is installed inside the boat, and the gearbox and propeller are outside.

[[Neutralization]]

CATEGORIES: Physical chemistry, Analytical chemistry, Thermodynamics

Neutralization occurs when a base is reacted with an acid. The OH- ions in the base react with the H+ ions in the acid to form H2O, water. In this reaction, the base is protonated and the acid is (deprotonation|deprotonated). To neutralise a substance (e.g alkali substance), you must put an equal amount of an acid into the alkali in order for it to become neutral(also known as pH 7). Titration uses neutralization to measure chemical concentrations.

[[Chloralkali process]]

CATEGORIES: Chemical processes, Electricity

The chloralkali process is a process used to create sodium hydroxide, chlorine, and hydrogen from sodium chloride and water. It is normally conducted in a tank separated by a membrane, although there are other methods, such as using mercury. If potassium chloride or calcium chloride is used instead, potassium hydroxide and calcium hydroxide are produced. When the membrane is not in place, hypochlorites are formed. If it is heated, chlorates are formed. 

The process is fueled by electrolysis. It can be done in the laboratory.
