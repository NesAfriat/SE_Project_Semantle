[[Pelican eel]]

CATEGORIES: Fish

The pelican eel (Eurypharynx pelecanoides) is a deep sea fish. They are rarely seen by humans, although these creatures are sometimes hooked on the nets of fishermen. It is a fish with the shape of an eel. 

It is the only known species of the genus Eurypharynx and the family Eurypharyngidae. It belongs to the order Saccopharyngiformes, which are closely related to the true eels.

The pelican eel's most notable feature is its huge mouth, much larger than its body. They can be opened wide enough to swallow a fish much larger than itself. The pouch-like lower jaw is similar to that of a pelican, hence its name. It is also sometimes referred to as the umbrella mouth gulper. The stomach can stretch and expand to make room for large meals. The eel uses a long, whip-like tail for movement, and the end of the tail is bright enough to attract prey.

The pelican eel feeds primarily on fish, shrimp and plankton. It grows to about 0.61 to 1 metre in length and is found in all tropical and subtropical seas at depths ranging from 900 to 8,000 metres (3,000 to 27,000 feet).

[[Cocos plate]]

CATEGORIES: Tectonic plates, Central America

The Cocos plate is a geologically young oceanic tectonic plate. It is beneath the Pacific Ocean off the west coast of Central America. Cocos Island  rides on it. 

The Cocos plate was created about 23 million years ago when a larger plate broke into two pieces. The other piece became the Nazca plate. The Cocos plate also broke into two pieces, creating the small Rivera plate. 

The Cocos plate touches several different plates. To the northeast it touches the North American plate and the Caribbean plate. To the west it touches the Pacific plate and to the south the Nazca plate.

This complicated set of little plates is caused by what geologists call the Cocos-Nazca spreading system. The leading edge is subducting (going under existing plates). This causes the Central American Volcanic Arc.

The Cocos Plate is near the Galapagos hotspot, which caused the Galapagos Islands.

[[Domain hack]]

CATEGORIES: Internet

A domain hack is a domain name that blends the text in a web address' domain (before the dot) with its top level domain (after the dot) to create a word (such as youtu.be), or a phrase (such as play.it).

In the example above, YouTube uses .be as part of their link shortening service, even though .be was meant to be used as a country code top level domain (ccTLD) for Belgium. Entercom Communications Corporation does the same thing with their play.it domain name, using Italy's ccTLD.

Matthew Doucette first used the term "domain hack" in a blog post on November 3rd, 2004.

Huntington, and, as President, himself. They bonded together as a team to build the first Transcontinental Railway. His role with them drove his politics, and his success in politics for what he was trying to do for Sacramento and California was very much driven by his position as the head of Southern Pacific Railroad.

Stanford was a white supremacist. In 1859, he wrote:I am in favor of free white American citizens. I prefer free white citizens to any other race. I prefer the white man to the negro as an inhabitant to our country.He spent one two-year term as Governor of California after his election in 1861.

[[Referential transparency]]

CATEGORIES: Computer programming

Referential transparency is a feature of parts of computer programs. A part of a program is called "referentially transparent" if it can be replaced with the value it gives back without changing the program's behavior. A referentially transparent function must be pure—it must always give the same output if it takes the same input, and it must not have any side effects—parts of the program that perform an action other than giving a value back. The opposite of referential transparency is referential opacity.

In mathematics, all functions are referentially transparent, because a mathematical function can only take values in and spit a value out. In programming, this is not always true—a function might also find out what day of the year it is, or print a message to the screen. Because of this difference, some people use other names for functions in programming, like procedures.

Referential transparency lets programmers and compilers to think of code as a rewrite system—something that takes an expression and replaces it with something else. This can help with several tasks, such as:

There are several ways of doing the last task—the most well-known are memoization (saving answers after the first time), common subexpression elimination 

(figuring out if it is worth it to combine two parts of the code that are the same) , lazy evaluation (not finding the answer until the code really needs it), and parallelization (working on multiple problems at the same time).

[[Side effect (computer science)]]

CATEGORIES: Computer science

A part of a program with a side effect performs a noticeable action other than giving back a value. Examples include showing a picture on a computer screen, or checking what year it is. Code with side effects can be harder to understand without any context, and the order of instructions more important for code with side effects. 

In functional programming, programmers try to avoid side effects when they can, so it is easier to prove that a program will always do what it is supposed to. In some functional languages, like Standard ML, Scheme, or Scala, side effects are not restricted, but programmers still try to use them less. In Haskell, actions with side effects must be stated explicitly—this makes it easier to tell what code does or does not have them.

[[2020 Belizean general election]]

CATEGORIES: 2020 elections, Politics of Belize

The 2020 Belizean general election will elect and the members of the House of Representatives in the National Assembly. On 14 March 2017, Prime Minister of Belize, Dean Barrow stated that he will call for early elections in November 2019. But in March 2018, Barrow pushed back and set it for 13 February 2020. On 22 May 2019, Barrow to the Media that he will strip off his call for early elections and insisted that there will be no General election before 1 November 2020 in Belize. Therefore, the next Belizean general election will be held on Sunday, 1 November 2020.

Date

The Deadline for Candidate Nominations will be on 1 October 2020, with political Campaigning lasting for four Weeks until Polling day on 1 November 2020. On the Day of the Election, Polling stations across the Country will be open from 7 am, and closed at 10 pm. The Date chosen for the election made it the third to be held in November since 1979.

Individuals eligible to vote have to be registered to vote by Midnight on 26 September 2020. To be eligible to vote, Individuals had to be aged 18 or over; residing as a Commonwealth citizen at an address in Belize, or a Belizean citizen overseas who registered to Vote in the last 15 years and not legally excluded (on grounds of detainment in Prison, a Mental hospital, or on the run from Law enforcement) or disqualified from Voting. Anyone who qualified as an Anonymous elector will have until midnight on 26 October to Register.

The previous general election was held on 4 November 2015, and the new National Assembly was opened on 13 November 2015, which was also the date that the first sitting of the National Assembly of Belize began after the 2015 Belizean general election. According to Section 84 of the Constitution of Belize, the National Assembly of Belize (House of Representatives and Senate) must be dissolved every “five years from the date when the two Houses, first met” unless dissolved sooner by the Governor-General of Belize upon the advice of the Prime Minister. A general election must be called within three months of a dissolution, meaning the latest possible date for Barrow to call the next Belizean general election is on 13 February 2021. If by any chance the next Belizean general election is not held by 13 February 2021, Barrow may be forced to vacate the office of Prime Minister, however he may still remain as Leader of the United Democratic Party (UDP), but he will have to make a Snap! decision on a Caretaker Prime Minister of Belize to formally announce a date for the next general election. The Caretaker Prime Minister must be from the ruling, UDP and must also be a Cabinet minister in government.

Despite the five-year term of the National Assembly, three of the last four general elections have been called at least a year early. Both Prime Minister, Dean Barrow and Leader of the Opposition, Johnny Briceño of the People’s United Party (PUP) are on record supporting lowering the maximum five-year term of the National Assembly of Belize to four years. This was also one of the promises that Briceño promised the People of Belize should the PUP be elected in the next election.

Barrow first declared on 1 March 2016 that he would be stepping down as Prime Minister on 13 February 2020 and is currently finding a suitable successor to succeed him for that position. He also told the Media that the next election is likely to be held in early 2020 and also scheduled a UDP Leadership convention and election in May 2019. His remarks came as he was being questioned about the then pending United Democratic Party First Deputy Leadership election and convention. On 1 April 2017, at the Belize Chamber of Commerce and Industry annual general meeting Barrow narrowed down his departure as Prime Minister to less than a year and stated that he will retire in March 2018. He also narrowed down the date of the Leadership convention to 13 February 2018. He also declared that “Since this will be my last opportunity to address your annual gathering, I close by saying how thankful I am for what has in the main been a constructive relationship with the Chamber”.

It's important to point out that in early 2017, Barrow was ailing with excruciating back pain; a serious condition that he was enduring for some time. He could barely sit upright without visible signs of pain on his face, It is understandable then, that in such a poor and un-stabilised state of health and having archived a historic 3-peat in government, he would welcome retirement. But on 1 September 2018, things changed, after swiftly enduring the back pain for more than a year, Barrow with uncontrollable pain vested in his back, proceeded to Cuba and requested the Doctors in a hospital there to perform a Spinal Surgery, the Cuban Doctors did as they were told by Barrow and they also did a phenomenal job. The surgery was a success and after one week of rest and recovery, Barrow returned to perfect health. So after the surgery was over, Barrow rescheduled his retirement once again this time to December 2019 and hinted he could do so earlier and also rescheduled the date for the UDP’s Leadership convention back to May 2019.

On 18 November 2018, Barrow’s cabinet by way of a strange press release urged him to remain as Prime Minister until the 2020 general election on 1 November 2020. They also urged him to remain as Leader of the UDP until February 2020. He said he will take that move and eventually for the final time, rescheduled the convention to February 2020. A significant walking back from his declaration at the 2017 Chamber meeting. On 4 December 2018, Minister of Human Development and Minister of Social Transformation, Anthony Martinez reveled to the media on why he and the Cabinet urged Barrow to remain as Prime Minister until 2020. Martinez stayed on course saying that Barrow ultimately took the decision and that the goal is for the currently leadership to take the UDP into a fourth term in government. A fourth term will be historic for the UDP as no political party in post-independence Belize has ever embarked on a fourth term. Plus this will also be a major upset for the majority of Belizeans who are expecting the PUP to cling win at the Next election.

Timetable

The key dates are:

Monday 10 February

Minister of National Security, John Saldivar elected as Leader of the UDP he swears in the Title of UDP Leader-elect while Barrow remains Official Leader. Saldivar defeats his opponent Deputy prime minister, Patrick Faber receiving 342 votes of the 569 votes cast. Faber only received 227 votes.

Background

United Democratic Party

The rulling United Democratic Party, which has been in power since 7 February 2008, will attempt to win a fourth consecutive general election. However, both major parties will be contesting this election with first-time leaders. UDP Leader and Prime Minister, Dean Barrow has stated he will step down from both positions on 2 November 2020, after the new Prime Minister of Belize has been officially sworn-in by Govonor-General, Colville Young. The UDP has initially scheduled a May 2019 convention and election, but after Barrow’s cabinet urged him to stay on as Prime Minister and Leader of the UDP, he pushed back that date in January 2019 to February 2020. Thus the United Democratic Party Leadership Convention and election will take place in February 2020. On 10 August 2019, The UDP’s National Party Council met and set the date of the UDP’s leadership convention and election on 9 February 2019. The venew will be at the Belize Civic Centre, according to the party organ, The Guardian. Deputy Prime Minister of Belize, Patrick Faber and Minister of National Security and Defence, John Saldivar will contest the position of, UDP Leader through other candidates can apply. Minister of Health, Pablo Marin will contest the position of, Deputy Leader of the UDP. Minister of Natural Resources, Hugo Patt is also expected to contest for Deputy Leader as well. Patt and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Wilfred Elrington was mentioned as possible candidates to contest the position of, UDP Leader. However, both declined the offer back in June 2018. On 5 June 2019, Belize Breaking News (BBN) published an article stating that the UDP has a high chance of capitalising and making history by wining a fourth consecutive term come 2020, given the results of the 2019 Belizean territorial dispute referendum went in the favour of the UDP. The UDP was Long campaigning for an “Yes” vote to bring Guatemala’s claim to the International Court of Justice (ICJ), while the PUP eyed the “No” vote while some of its Politicians still supported “Yes” as they thought that was the right thing to do. Nevertheless, results are results and this could determine who would win the next general election. The UDP, which has already served an unprecedented three consecutive terms has gone the extra mile in securing their mandate. A victory in the next election would be monumental as the party navigates new Leadership with the departure of several senior members. The UDP Cabinet, though marred by waves of Scandal and revelations of systemic Corruption across Government departments throughout its 11-year reign, has withered the political Storms. The UDP looks to continue its decade-Long Dominance (ethology) over Belizean Politics.

People’s United Party

The People’s United Party has yet to prove it can win a general election since its last victory in 2005, 14 years ago; a virtual eon in politics. Despite gains in Belize City in 2015, most notably Kareem Musa’s upset win over Belize City Mayor, Darrell Bradley in the Caribbean Shores constituency, the opposition PUP remained at 11 seats overall thanks to losses in the Cayo and Corozal Districts. However, after Former Senate President, Lee Mark Chang bested opponent Leila Peyrefitte in the UDP convention held in Carribean Shores constituency, there have been rumours that if the win indicated that Caribbean Shores would go red next year, also given that the “Yes” vote prevailed in Caribbean Shores for the 2019 Referendum. Area Representative, Kareem Musa said that he did not ask a single voter to vote yes or no in the referendum and that he is confident of next victory at polls. The PUP will run with Johnny Briceño as it's Leader. Francis Fonseca, who led the party during the past two general elections, resigned from leadership soon after the party’s 2015 loss. Although Briceño served a previous term as PUP leader from 2008 to 2011, he has yet to led the party during a General election and do what Fonseca could not, steer the party into a victory. On the morning of Briceño swearing-in as Leader of the party.

[[Kingdom of Koya]]

CATEGORIES: Former monarchies of Africa

The Kingdom of Kquoja or Koya or Koya Temne, or the Temne Kingdom (1505–1896), was a pre-colonial African state. It was located  in the north of  Sierra Leone. Its capital was at Cape Mount in what is now Liberia.

The kingdom was founded by the Temne ethnic group in or around 1505. Migrants from  the north who wanted to trade with the Portuguese in the south founded the kingom. 

It was ruled by a king called a Bai or Obai. The sub-kingdoms within the state were ruled by nobles titled "Gbana". The Koya Kingdom kept and maintained diplomatic relations with the British and French in the 18th century. Children of Temne nobles were allowed to get western educations abroad. Koya also traded with Islamic states to its north and had Muslims within its borders.

Under Nembanga's reign (1775–1793), the Koya kingdom signed a treaty which made it possible for the establishment of a British colony on the peninsula of Sierra Leone in 1788.

Koya participated in the trans-atlantic slave trade, though sources state that such commerce was much more privatized than in other kingdoms. Subjects of Koya traded in slaves on the coast even against the wishes of the state at times.

From 1801 to 1807, Koya fought a war with British colonists and the Susu. Koya lost the northern shoreline of Sierra Leone to the British and Port Loko to the Susu. However, they remained a power in the region. In 1815, the Temne fought another war with the Susu and regained the port. In 1841, the Temne defeated the Loko tribe of Kasona on the Mabaole River dispersing many of the people. In response to a British bombardment, the kingdom expelled the Church Missionary Society missionaries operating at Magbela in 1860.

The kingdom became a British protectorate August 31, 1896. At that point the Koya kings lost almost all power. Revolts of the Temne and Mende in 1898 were fierce but futile. The British would govern the area of the former kingdom until 1961.

The Yemeni Civil War is an ongoing conflict that began in 2015 between two factions: the Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi led Yemeni government and the Houthi armed movement, along with their supporters and allies. Both claim to constitute the official government of Yemen. Houthi forces currently controlling the capital Sanaʽa, allied with forces loyal to the former president Ali Abdullah Saleh, have clashed with the forces loyal to Hadi who are based in Aden. Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant have also carried out attacks, with AQAP controlling swathes of territory in the hinterlands, and along stretches of the coast. On 21 March 2015, after taking over Sanaʽa and the Yemeni government, the Houthi-led Supreme Revolutionary Committee declared a general mobilization to overthrow Hadi and expand their control by driving into southern provinces. The Houthi offensive, allied with military forces loyal to Saleh, began fighting the next day in Lahij Governorate. By 25 March, Lahij fell to the Houthis and they reached the outskirts of Aden, the seat of power for Hadi's government. Hadi fled the country the same day. At the same time, a coalition led by Saudi Arabia launched military operations by using air strikes to restore the former Yemeni government. The United States provided intelligence and logistical support for the campaign. 

According to the UN and other sources, from March 2015 to December 2017, between 8,670–13,600 people were killed in Yemen, including more than 5,200 civilians,. They estimated more than 50,000 have died as a result of an ongoing famine due to the war. With Iran suporting the Huthi and Saudi Arabia opposing them, the conflict has been widely seen as a proxy war and a means for Saudi Arabia to combat Iranian influence in the region. 

In 2018, the United Nations warned that 13 million Yemeni civilians face starvation in what it says could become "the worst famine in the world in 100 years." The international community sharply condemned the Saudi Arabian-led bombing campaign, which included widespread bombing of civilian areas. The bombing campaign has killed or injured an estimated 17,729 civilians as of March 2019 according to the Yemen Data Project. Despite this, the crisis gained less international media attention than the Syrian civil war. The US has been providing bombs to aid the Saudi forces and airstrikes in Yemen. In March 2019, this led the US senate to pass a resolution to end US support of Saudi Arabia. It was vetoed by President of the United States Donald Trump, and in May, the Senate failed to override the veto.

Gangkhar Puensum is a 7570 mountain in the Himalayas range, in Bhutan and Tibet. It is the 40th highest mountain in the world. It is also known as Kangkar Pünzum. The name means "White Peak of the Three Spiritual Brothers". No one has ever made it to the top of Gangkhar Puensum. It is the highest mountain in the world that has never been climbed.

Details about the mountain have not always been correct. It was first measured in 1922, but not all maps showed the same height. There was also confusion on the location of the mountain. Some maps showed it in different places than others. Due to this confusion, the first team to try to climb it wasn’t even able to find it at all. The present listed height and location are from China, as Bhutan has not surveyed the mountain.

A few people have tried to climb the mountain in the past, but none succeeded. In 1994, Bhutan made a law that no one could climb above 6000. Then in 2003, they banned all climbing. As long as the ban is in place, it is unlikely that anyone will reach the top from the Bhutan side. While it may be possible to start the climb in Tibet, China has not allowed it. Tibet is an autonomous region of the People's Republic of China (PRC). This is a political decision due to issues in the border region between China and Bhutan. There is a border dispute between the two countries.

[[Citypoint]]

CATEGORIES: Skyscrapers in the United Kingdom, Buildings and structures in London

Citypoint (previously known as Britannic House and Britannic Tower) is a skyscraper located on Ropemaker Street on the northern part of the City of London, the main financial district and historic center of London.

Originally named Britannic House, Citypoint was built in 1967 as a 35-storey, 122 tall headquarters for British Petroleum (now BP). This became the first building in the City of London area to pass the height of St Paul's Cathedral. The designers were F. Milton Cashmore and H. N. W. Grosvenor. In 1991 British Petroleum moved back to their original headquarters on Finsbury Circus and the building was renamed Britannic Tower.

It was refurbished in 2000, with additional floor space and the height increased to 127. Sheppard Robson helped to improve the building. It was then renamed to Citypoint.

Citypoint is the seventh-tallest building in the City, after the Heron Tower, 122 Leadenhall Street, Tower 42, 30 St Mary Axe, Broadgate Tower and 20 Fenchurch Street but only the 23rd-tallest in Greater London.

In August 2005 its owner, Pillar Properties, sold the building for more than £500 million in one of the largest deals ever seen in the City office market.

In early 2007 the building was again put on the market, this time for £650 million, and purchased by a private American company called Beacon Capital Partners. At the time it was the most expensive building sale in the United Kingdom. However 8 Canada Square at Canary Wharf eclipsed this by some margin just a few months later when it was sold for over £1 billion.

A number of other large buildings are planned on sites nearby. These include a 43-storey, 140 residential tower at Milton Court. A 90 office tower at Ropemaker Place has also been developed by British Land.

The Redwood National and State Parks (RNSP) are a group of state and national parks in the United States. They are on the coast of northern California. These parks include Redwood National Park, Del Norte Coast Redwoods State Park, Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park, and Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park. Together, the parks contain 139,000,

The parks have old-growth temperate rainforests. The four parks include 45% of all remaining coast redwood forests. These total at least 38982. These trees are the tallest and one of the biggest trees on Earth. In addition to the redwood forests, the parks protect much nature within the area.

In 1850, old-growth redwood forest covered more than 2000000 of the California coast. The northern part of that area was noticed by lumbermen and others when a gold rush brought them to the region. As they did not become rich from gold, these men decided to log the gigantic trees. The timber went to San Francisco and other places on the West Coast.

After many decades of  logging, efforts were started in conservation. In the 1920s the Save the Redwoods League worked to save old-growth redwoods. Due to their efforts, a number of State Parks were formed. Then in 1968, Redwood National Park was created. By that time nearly 90% of the original redwood trees had been logged. The National Park Service (NPS) and the California Department of Parks and Recreation (CDPR) combined the management of Redwood National Park with the three Redwood State Parks in 1994.

The ecosystem of the RNSP preserves a number of threatened animal species. These include the tidewater goby, Chinook salmon, northern spotted owl, and Steller's sea lion. The United Nations made the parks a World Heritage Site on 5 September 1980. Other parts of the area were added on 30 June 1983.

[[Causes of World War I]]

CATEGORIES: World War I

The First World War lasted from 1914 to 1918.  It was caused by the buildup of tension between countries. The three long-term causes were the formation of empires, the accumulation of armies and weapons, and alliances. The trigger cause was the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand.

One of the causes of World War I was that countries wanted to form empires.  This is called imperialism. From the late 1800s, the power of an empire was judged by its size. Britain had the largest empire, with lots of territories overseas, such as India. People would say "The sun never sets on the British Empire" because there were British holdings all over the world, so it was always day in some part of the empire. 

In order to conquer far-away places on different continents, imperial powers built large armies and navies and the cultures valued fighting. This is called militarism.  Countries spent large amounts of money in a short amount of time to build these armies.  In the early 1900s, Britain's navy was the biggest.  This made their traditional rival, Germany want to make a big navy too.  When Britain launched a new kind of ship called the Dreadnought, Germany launched their own version of the Dreadnought to compete with Britain.

The third long-term cause was alliances. The bigger countries of Europe formed two sides. They were called the "Triple Entente" and the "Triple Alliance." The Triple Entente included France, Great Britain, and Russia. The Triple Alliance was Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy. Great Britain, France, and Russia were worried about the growing strength of Germany, so they promised to help each other if any one of them was attacked. Germany objected to this arrangement because, with France and Great Britain on the west and Russia on the east, Germany would be surrounded.  So Germany formed an alliance with Austria-Hungary and Italy.

The trigger cause of World War I was the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, who was next in line to be emperor of Austro-Hungary.  He was killed in Sarajevo on June 28, 1914.  He and his wife, Countess Sophie, both died.  They were making a state visit to the capital of Bosnia. A Serbian secret society, the Black Hand, wanted Bosnia to break free from the Austro-Hungarian Empire and be a country by itself. They were supported by Russia. The Archduke and his wife arrived at 9:30 a.m. and got into an open-topped car at the train station. Members of the Black Hand had learned the route they would take to their destination. When the time came, one of them threw a hand grenade at the Archduke's car. It bounced off the back of the car, which drove on. It injured the driver and passengers in the car behind the Archduke instead. When the Archduke realized he was a target he immediately abandoned his planned trip and went to visit a hospital instead. However, the driver took a wrong turn up Franz Joseph Street and had to reverse. By chance, he slowed down in front of Gavrilo Princip, leader of the Black Hand. Seeing that this was his only chance to carry out his plan, he pulled his gun and fired, killing the Archduke, Sophie, who had been pregnant at the time. Gavrilo Princip was arrested and beaten up for this rebellious act.

Austria-Hungary was outraged that the heir to their throne had been killed. They blamed Serbia and bombed the capital, Belgrade.  The Serbians tried to surrender, but Austria-Hungary bombed them anyway. Serbia's ally, Russia, then helped to defend it from attack. Soon after, Germany, Austria-Hungary's ally, declared war on Russia as well as starting to move towards French territory, ready to invade, attacking Belgium as they progressed. The French soldiers started to get ready for a German invasion. When Germany declared war on France, then under the terms of the Triple Entente, Britain then ordered Germany to stop attacking Belgium, who was neutral during the war. When the Germans didn't retreat from Belgium, Britain declared war on Germany. Finally, Austria-Hungary declared war on Russia and WWI commenced.

[[Battle royale game]]

CATEGORIES: Video game genres

A battle royale game is an online multiplayer video game genre that combines the survival, exploration, and scavenging (collecting useful items from what looks like waste) in a game where only one can remain, also known as a last-man-standing game. Battle royale games usually have a large number of players, ranging from tens to hundreds, that start with almost nothing who then try to defeat all other enemies/players while trying to stay inside of a play zone or "safe area" that gets smaller over time. The winner is the last player or team alive. The name for the genre is taken from the 2000 Japanese movie Battle Royale, which has a similar theme of a last-man-standing competition in a shrinking play zone.

The genre's origins arose from mods for large-scale online survival games like Minecraft and ARMA 2 in the early 2010s. By the end of the decade, the genre became a cultural phenomenon, with standalone games such as PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, Fortnite Battle Royale and Apex Legends each having received tens of millions of players within months of their  release.

Many protests were held in Hong Kong and other cities around the world, protesting against the bill.

People worried that the bill would cause the city to open itself up to the reach of mainland Chinese law and that people from Hong Kong could become subject to a different legal system.

Various protests have been launched in Hong Kong by the general public and legal communities. Among these, the 9 June protest organised by the Civil Human Rights Front (CHRF), had 1.03 million people protest on the streets. Protests in other places were also launched by overseas Hongkongers and locals.

Despite the widespread demonstrations, the government initially insisted on the bill's passage, saying that the bill was urgent and that the legal "loophole" should be fixed. On 15 June 2019, Carrie Lam announced the suspension of the bill. On 4 September, Lam promised that the bill would be withdrawn when the Legislative Council started again in October.

[[History of Kansas]]

CATEGORIES: History of Kansas

The first people who lived in Kansas were Native Americans who were nomadic (people who don't live in one place for very long). They hunted American bison. In the 1500s, Spanish conquistadores came to explore the place. Later, French fur trappers came to the area. They traded with the Native Americans. The United States added most of Kansas in the Louisiana Purchase in 1803. In 1854, the Kansas-Nebraska Act opened the place for Americans to move there. A lot of fighting happened because the new residents had to decide if they wanted slavery. The new residents decided to make slavery illegal. The fighting helped start the American Civil War.

After the Civil War, Kansas had many frontier towns. The railroads were stops for cattle drives from Texas. Many black people moved from the south to Kansas. These people were called "exodusters". Farmers tried growing corn and raising pigs, but there was little rain, so they were not able to. They started growing wheat. They became very good at growing wheat, and they had enough to trade with Europe. Many angry farmers joined the Populist and Progressive movement in the 1890s, and they supported it until the 1940s. Since the 1940s, Kansas has been a very conservative state. Since 1945, the number of farmers has lowered, and manufacturing has become more popular.

[[User (computing)]]

CATEGORIES: Computers

A user is a person who uses a computer or network service. Users of computer systems typically have no experience on how the software works.

In order to identify oneself, a user has an account (a user account) and a username (also called a screen name, handle, nickname, or nick on some systems), and in most cases also a password.

A user account allows one to authenticate to system services. It also generally provides one with the opportunity to be authorized to access them. However, authentication does not automatically mean authorization. Once the user has logged on, the operating system will often use an identifier such as an integer to refer to them, rather than their username.

His goal was to create a market for RCA's photophone, which was their sound-on-film technology. By the mid-1940s, the studio was under the control of investor Floyd Odlum.

RKO is well known for the musicals it made in the 1930s. These starred Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. Other well-known actors got their start at RKO.

[[Solar sail]]

CATEGORIES: Spaceflight, Alternative propulsion, Solar energy

A solar sail (or light sails or photon sails) is a proposed method of spacecraft propulsion using radiation pressure exerted by sunlight. The word 'sail' is by analogy with boats which use a sail to use wind to move. The concept was first proposed in the 17th century by Johannes Kepler. He had a theory that sails could be adapted to "heavenly breezes".

In 1865, James Clerk Maxwell published his theory of electromagnetic fields and radiation. He showed that light (one form of electromagnetic radiation) can put pressure on an object. This pressure is called radiation pressure.  This provided a foundation for the science behind the solar sail. 

Solar radiation exerts a pressure on the sail due to reflection and a small fraction that is absorbed.

Solar pressure acts on  spacecraft, in space or in orbit around a planet. A typical spacecraft going to Mars, for example, is displaced thousands of kilometers by solar pressure. The effects are predicted in planning. This has been done since the time of the early interplanetary spacecraft of the 1960s. Solar pressure also affects the orientation of a craft, a factor that is included in spacecraft design.

The concept of solar sail was later used science fiction, such as the works of Jules Verne.

In April 2018, the United Nations General Assembly declared June 3 as International World Bicycle Day. The resolution for World Bicycle Day recognizes "the uniqueness, longevity and versatility of the Bicycle, which has been in use for two centuries, and that it is a simple, affordable, reliable, clean and environmentally fit sustainable means of transportation."

Professor Leszek Sibilski from the United States led a grassroots campaign with his Sociology class to promote a UN Resolution for World Bicycle Day, eventually gaining the support of Turkmenistan and 56 other countries.  The original UN Blue and White World Bicycle Day logo was designed by Isaac Feld and the accompanying animation was done by Professor John E. Swanson.  It depicts bicyclists of various types riding around the globe.  At the bottom of the logo is the hashtag #June3WorldBicycleDay. The main message is that the bicycle belongs to and serves all of humanity.

World Bicycle Day is a global holiday meant to be enjoyed by all people regardless of race, ethnicity, creed, class, sex, gender, age, sexual orientation, or any other characteristic.  The bicycle as a symbol of human progress and advancement "promotes tolerance, mutual understanding and respect and facilitates social inclusion and a culture of peace." 

World Bicycle Day is now being associated with promoting a healthy lifestyle for those with diabetes.

[[Cliff Morrison]]

CATEGORIES: Nurses, American activists, Living people, HIV/AIDS

Cliff Morrison is an activist and a nurse who established the first hospital ward for treating AIDS patients in the United States. Ward 5B was established in San Francisco General Hospital in 1983. When the ward was opened there was little known about this illness, and patients with the disease were regarded as worthy of disgrace and/or disapproval.

When Ward 5B was opened AIDS was considered a death sentence. Every single person diagnosed with AIDS died in those days. No one knew  what caused this disease and how it was passed on from person to person. Some of the caregivers refused to treat patients. Patients in hospitals would not be bathed, because nurses did not want to touch them for fear of contracting AIDS themselves.

Ward 5B was the first hospital  ward where the medical team comforted patients by touching them.  Patients were allowed to furnish their rooms and make them like home. They were even allowed to bring  in pets.Families and partners were allowed to visit patients any time.

Ward 5B became a model for many other hospitals in the United States and in other countries.

Cliff Morrison grew up in Live Oak, Florida. His family was a very poor.  When he was young he worked on his family’s farm. The family had no car, no telephone, no television and no access to healthcare.

At age twelve Morrison got a job at a local hospital mopping floors, taking out trash, and working in the laundry. He worked his way up to orderly. Doctors and nurses at the hospital liked him. They encouraged him to go to college and helped him get a scholarship.

In 1969 Morrison started studying at Florida Community College in Jacksonville when he was 17 years old. He was the youngest student ever in the nursing program. He was also the first person in his family to go to college. 

Morrison admits to being embarrassed studying what  is considered a woman’s profession. However, earning $10,000 as a nurse  would allow him to enter   medical school if he wanted to. Afterwards he moved to Miami to complete his education. 

In 1980, Morrison became a clinical nurse specialist in the Department of Psychiatry and Forensic Services at San Francisco General.

[[2020 United Democratic Party (Belize) leadership election and convention]]

CATEGORIES: 2020

The 2020 United Democratic Party leadership election and convention will elect the Next Leader of the United Democratic Party (UDP). It was triggered on 18 November 2018, when Prime Minister of Belize, Dean Barrow‘s cabinet urged him to remain as Prime Minister of Belize until 2 November 2020, a day after the Next Belizean general election on 1 November 2020. Barrow’s Cabinet also urged him to remain as Leader of the UDP until February 2020. He said he will take that move and eventually scheduled the United Democratic Party (UDP) leadership election and convention to February 2020, meaning that the 2020 United Democratic Party leadership election and convention will be held in February 2020, unfortunately no firm date has been set yet. Barrow told the Media that he will schedule a few dates for the various ballots to take place when the date nearers. Nominations will be opened in January 2020 and so far two Candidates of the UDP will be contesting this Leadership election and convention. There will be a total of three ballots. The first ballot will be endorsment and voting by the current leader of the UDP and Prime Minister of Belize, Dean Barrow.The second ballot will be from the former members and Candidates of the UDP who will be voting and the third ballot is from the people of Belize. There will also be a exhaustive ballots of MPs also talking place in mid-February 2020. The ultimate decision will be made but the general membership of the party who will elect the leader by postal ballot. The results will be announced by the end of February 2020.

Speculation about a leadership election first arose back in 2006, just before the 2006 Belizean municipal elections. Barrow told LOVE FM that he will resign as Leader of the UDP If his party loses the Municipal Elections. The UDP has not defeated the than rulling People’s United Party (PUP) in any election until the 2006 municipal elections and the UDP was not doing very well after Barrow called for Civil Unrest In 2005. At that point debt troubles cloud the future, indeed the future of the UDP and Dean Barrow is nebulous in its own way. Barrow also stated that it was the proper thing to do and he would call for a Leadership election and convention if the UDP continues onto the path of darkness prior to the 2006 municipal elections. However, that all changed after the UDP won a landslide victory in the 2006 Municipal elections and eventually took control of the government realms in the 2008 Belizean general election on 7 February 2008.

Background

After being in power for seven years the People’s United Party was desperate to win the 2006 Belizean municipal elections and govern the country like never before. It has never lost even one election whether general election, municipal elections or Village council elections since coming to power after the 1998 Belizean general election on 27 August 1998. The UDP however, was faced with a shocking traumatic defeat in the 1998 general election with only three of the UDP Candidates getting elected in that General election. Barrow and Member of Parliament for Mesopotamia constituency, Michael Finnegan were the only two Members of Parliament and Area Representatives to be re-elected to their constituencies. Erwin Contreras narrowly defeated PUP’s Amin Hegar In Cayo West constituency and became the only newly elected UDP MP and Area Representative. Several UDP Ministers and Members went down to defeat. One of them was prominent then Leader of the UDP, Manuel Esquivel who also served as Prime Minister of Belize since 1984 and has been leading the UDP since 1983.

Aftermath

After the 1998 Belizean general election, Esquivel stepped down as Leader of the UDP On 28 August 1998, after being it's leader for 15 years. Esquivel also called a snap 1998 United Democratic Party (Belize) leadership election and convention on 28 August 1998. He scheduled the leadership election and convention to take place on 30 August 1998 and in his last address to the nation as leader of the UDP, Esquivel said that it's time for the UDP to “renew itself from the top and embark once more on the road to victory”. Nomination day was open on 29 August 1998 and than First Deputy Leader of the UDP, Barrow was the only person who submitted his nominations to contest in the UDP leadership election and convention at deadline. When the results for the 1998 United Democratic Party Leadership election and convention were out, Barrow won unopposed as Leader of the UDP and was sworn-in by Governor-General of Belize, Colville Young as Leader of the UDP and Leader of the Opposition.
