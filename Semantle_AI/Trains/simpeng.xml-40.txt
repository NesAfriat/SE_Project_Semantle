[[Karl Weierstraß]]

CATEGORIES: 1815 births, 1897 deaths, German mathematicians

Karl Theodor Wilhelm Weierstraß (31 October 1815 - 19 February 1897) was a German mathematician. Most of his work is about using logic as a thorough foundation of analysis. He mainly used power series for this. He also provided foundations for the theory of elliptic functions, differential geometry and the calculus of variations. The Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem is named in his honour: according to the theorem, finite series have certain properties: finite convergent series of complex numbers have at least one limit point, those of real numbers have at least two. He criticised earlier mathematicians for using assumptions too often, and being too vague in their definitions.

[[Rachel Berry]]

CATEGORIES: Fictional American people, Glee, Television characters

Rachel Berry is a fictional character from the FOX musical comedy-drama series Glee. The character is played by actress Lea Michele. The character first appeared in Glee from its pilot episode. It was first broadcast on May 19, 2009. Rachel was created by Glee creators Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk and Ian Brennan. She is the glee club captain of the fictional William McKinley High School in Lima, Ohio, where the show is set. Her storylines have seen her suffer feeling alone because of her ambition to win. She has also developed romantic feelings for Jesse St. James (Jonathan Groff), a member of the rival (enemy) glee club Vocal Adrenaline. She also had many dates with quarterback and glee club co-captain Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith). The two eventually become engaged.

Michele has stated that she was just like Rachel when she was younger. She had inspiration to play the role as Rachel.  These include the movie Election and other television roles such as the Gossip Girl character Blair Waldorf. Michele has said that she feels "vulnerable" while playing Rachel. She stated, "Rachel will never be popular because her looks aren't (are not) considered beautiful, and when I was in high school it was the same for me. I didn't get a nose job, and every single girl around me did. Therefore, I was out." Michele added, "What's so great about Glee is that it shows you how that kind of stuff hurts, but it doesn't matter: You can still be who you want to be."

Rachel is a "strong, driven girl" but somewhat nervous about herself. Glee follows Rachel's journey to become more of a team player. She does this to fulfill her own dreams. Michele was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for "Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series" in 2010. She was also nominated for a Golden Globe Award for "Best Actress - Television Series Musical or Comedy" in 2010 and 2011. Rachel has received mostly positive reviews from critics. Maureen Ryan of The Chicago Tribune thanked Michele for making the character "more than a humorless (not funny) stereotype". However, The Wall Street Journal's Raymund Flandez has described Rachel as "insufferable" (annoying). Several songs performed by Michele as Rachel have been released as digital download singles. They have also been included on the series' soundtrack albums.

[[Max Payne]]

CATEGORIES: 2001 video games, PlayStation 2 games, Shooter video games, Xbox games

Max Payne is a third-person shooter video game made by Finnish developers Remedy Entertainment and published by Gathering of Developers in July 2001 for Microsoft Windows. Later in 2001, ports for PlayStation 2, Xbox and GameBoy Advance were published by Rockstar Games. A Macintosh port was published in July 2002 by MacSoft in North America, and by Feral Interactive in the rest of the world. There were plans for a Dreamcast version of Max Payne, but they were cancelled because of the console had stopped being made. The game was again released in April 2009 as a downloadable game for the Xbox Originals program for the Xbox 360.

The game features a neo-noir type style and uses comic strips (with voice-overs) in place of animated cutscenes to narrate the game. This is because it is inspired by hard-boiled detective novels by authors like Mickey Spillane. The game contains many references to Norse mythology, particularly the myth of Ragnarök. Several of the names used in the game are those of Norse gods. The gameplay is very much influenced by the Hong Kong action cinema genre, particularly the work of director John Woo, and it was the first game to feature the bullet time effect made famous in The Matrix.

Max Payne got very good reviews from critics and was praised for its exciting gun play and use of noir storytelling devices. As of 2012, the Max Payne franchise has sold over 7.5 million copies. The game has also won a BAFTA Award.

Every transuranium element is a chemical element with an atomic number greater than the atomic number of Uranium. These elements have atomic numbers greater than 92.

The word "transuranium" is made of two parts. The Greek prefix trans- means "beyond" or "across". The second part of the word is the name of the element "uranium".   

Many transuranium elements are unstable and are not found in nature. An element that is unstable will split into two or more other elements. The process of fission occurs when an element splits into pieces.

[[Carol Greider]]

Carolyn Widney "Carol" Greider (born April 15, 1961) is an American molecular biologist. She is Professor and Director of Molecular Biology and Genetics at Johns Hopkins University. 

Greider discovered the enzyme telomerase in 1984, when she was a graduate student of Elizabeth Blackburn at the University of California, Berkeley. Greider pioneered research on the structure of telomeres, the ends of the chromosomes. She was awarded the 2009 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine, with Blackburn and Jack Szostak, for their discovery that telomeres are protected from progressive shortening by the enzyme telomerase.

[[Telomerase]]

CATEGORIES: Enzymes, Chromosomes

Telomerase is an RNA protein which is an enzyme. It adds DNA sequence repeats ("TTAGGG" in all vertebrates) to the end of DNA strands in the telomere regions. 

The telomeres are disposable buffers blocking the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes. They are a region of repeated nucleotides containing noncoding DNA. Telomeres are destroyed during cell division, and are remade by the enzyme telomerase.

The function of telomeres is to avoid the loss of important DNA from chromosome ends. Every time the chromosome is copied 100–200 meaningless nucleotides are lost, which causes no damage to the organism's DNA. So, the telomeres are shortened after each replication cycle, and then are restored to their proper length by telomerase. Telomerases carry their own RNA molecule, which is used as a template to elongate the telomeres.

The existence of a compensatory mechanism (a 'fix') for telomere shortening was first predicted by Soviet biologist Alexey Olovnikov in 1973. He also suggested the telomere hypothesis of ageing and the telomere's connections to cancer. 

Telomerase was discovered by Carol Greider and Elizabeth Blackburn in 1984 in the ciliate Tetrahymena. Together with Jack Szostak, Greider and Blackburn were awarded the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discovery.

[[Luc Montagnier]]

CATEGORIES: 1932 births, Living people, French academics, French biologists, French Nobel Prize winners, Legion of Honour, People from Centre-Val de Loire, Virologists

Luc Antoine Montagnier (born 18 August 1932 in Chabris, Indre, France) is a French virologist and joint recipient with Françoise Barré-Sinoussi and Harald zur Hausen of the 2008 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, for the discovery made by his team, and particularly Françoise Baré-Sinoussi of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). He currently works as a full time professor at Shanghai Jiaotong University.

He has been discredited by his Nobel peers because of the many fake and dangerous theories he tries to spread, such as "DNA teleportation" or Papaya Cure for AIDS or Parkinson disease. In 2009 he published two controversial research studies which, if true, "would be the most significant experiments performed in the past 90 years, demanding re-evaluation of the whole conceptual framework of modern chemistry". 

Homeopaths claim his research as support for homeopathy, but Montagnier himself says it cannot be extended to homeopathy. Many scientists have greeted it with scorn and harsh criticism.

He received the Legion of Honour.

Leland Harrison (Lee) Hartwell (born October 30, 1939, in Los Angeles, California) is former president and director of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, Washington.  He shared the 2001 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Paul Nurse and Tim Hunt, for their discoveries of protein molecules that control cell division.

When cells divide, they divide in phases called G1 (growth), S (synthesis), G2 (growth), and M (mitosis). Nurse, Hartwell and Hunt together discovered two proteins, cyclin and CDK (cyclin dependent kinase), which control the change from one stage to another. These proteins are called checkpoints, because they check whether the cell has divided properly. If the cell does not divide correctly, other proteins will try to repair it. If that does not work, they will destroy the cell. If a cell divides incorrectly and survives, it may cause cancer and other serious diseases.

Working in baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), Hartwell identified the fundamental role of checkpoints in cell cycle control, and CDC genes such as CDC28, which controls the start of the cycle – the progression through G1.

[[Yutyrannus]]

CATEGORIES: Cretaceous dinosaurs, Coelurosaurs, Dinosaurs of Asia

Yutyrannus  is a Tyrannosauroid dinosaur, an early forebear of Tyrannosaurus rex.

It lived during the Lower Cretaceous 

124.6 million years ago (mya). It was about 10 meters long and 3 meters tall, and is the largest known dinosaur with direct evidence of feathers. It is forty times heavier than the previous record holder, Beipiaosaurus. The feathers were long, up to 20, and filamentous.

The fossil was found in what is now northeastern China. Three fossils of Y. huali, were  all found in the rock beds of Liaoning Province. Because of its size, it is certain that Yutyrannus could not fly. The feathers supported other functions, such as temperature regulation and visual signalling.

Yutyrannus is known from three nearly complete fossil specimens (an adult, a subadult and a juvenile). They were got from a fossil dealer who claimed all three were found in a single quarry at Batuyingzi in Liaoning Province. They were probably found in a layer of the Yixian Formation.

This seabed feature is named after Saikaidō, which was the name given to the southern region of Japan during the Asuka period.

[[Totem and Taboo]]

CATEGORIES: 1914 books, Science books

Totem and Taboo is a book by Sigmund Freud. It is four articles in the magazine Imago then combined as a book in 1914. The first article is "The Horror of Incest", the second "Taboo and Emotional Ambivalence", the third "animism, magic, and the omnipotence of thought", and the fourth "the return of totemism in childhood". It was written partly as a response to Wilhelm Wundt's ideas on psychology, and partly as a response to Carl Jung's ideas. It describes Freud's idea of how the incest taboo began. The last article combines Charles Darwin's idea of an ancient family with William Robertson Smith's idea of human sacrifice being the origin of religious ceremonies, to argue that an ancient group of brothers killed their polygamous father and took his wives and then created totemism as an idea to create conscience and prevent their action from being repeated.

[[Alexander Gorsky]]

CATEGORIES: Choreographers, 1871 births, 1924 deaths, Russian people

Alexander Gorsky (6 August 1871–1924) was a Russian ballet choreographer and a contemporary of Marius Petipa. He is known for restaging Petipa’s classical ballets such as Swan Lake, Don Quixote, and The Nutcracker.  Gorsky "sought greater naturalism, realism, and characterization" in ballet. He valued acting skills over bravura technique (a showy display of skills such as many turns or high jumps.)  His interpretations of ballets were often controversial and he often used artists outside the dance world to create sets and costumes.  Gorsky gave continuity to the plots of Petipa’s ballets and removed excessive choreography that did not relate to the story.

[[William Smith (geologist)]]

CATEGORIES: English geologists, 1769 births, 1839 deaths

William 'Strata' Smith (23 March 1769 – 28 August 1839) was an English geologist, who created the first nationwide geological map.

Like another great scientist of his time, Michael Faraday, he was the son of a blacksmith. His geological discoveries were made when, as a young man, he was a surveyor, and so travelled the country. Smith's greatest discovery was that sedimentary rocks of a similar age held fossils of a similar type. So he could identify them when they were at the surface in different parts of the country.

Smith put together the historical geology of Britain (England and Wales) and southern Scotland into a single record. At the time his map was published he was almost unknown to the scientific community. His humble family and education meant he did not mix easily in learned society. His work was plagiarised, he was financially ruined, and he spent time in debtors' prison. It was only later in his life that Smith got recognition for what he had done.

[[Biological species concept]]

CATEGORIES: Evolutionary biology

The biological species concept gives an explanation of how species form (speciation). A biological species is a group of individuals that can breed together (panmixia). However, they cannot breed with other groups. In other words, the group is reproductively isolated from other groups.

According to Ernst Mayr, a new species forms when an existing species splits. A similar idea had been suggested in the 19th century by Moritz Wagner. Dobzhansky described the role of reproductive isolation in the formation of new species. Once a species lives in two different areas, the geographical isolation makes breeding between the groups reduce or stop. Each group develops features which make breeding between them work less well. Eventually, each group becomes a 'good' biological species, because the two species do not reproduce with each other even when they are together.

This is still considered the most common reason for species splitting, and has the technical name of allopatric speciation. It is contrasted with sympatric speciation where speciation takes place even though all the members live in the same area.

[[Kyushu-Palau Ridge]]

CATEGORIES: Pacific Ocean, Volcanoes of Asia

Kyushu-Palau Ridge (KPR) is an ocean floor feature in the Philippine Sea. It is named after the nearby islands. At the northern end is the Japanese island of Kyushu. At the southern end is the Pacific island nation of Palau.

The seabed ridge begins in an area about 900 km from the eastern end of the Bungo Channel or "Bungo strait" between the Japanese islands of Kyushu and Shikoku.  The ridge creates a line on the ocean floor which runs southeast in the direction of the island of Palau.  There is a chain of extinct volcanos on this line.

KPR is southeast of the Japanese island of Kyushu.

[[Seamount]]

CATEGORIES: Seamounts

A seamount is a mountain rising from the ocean sea floor. It does not reach to the water's surface (sea level), and so is not an island. These are usually formed from submarine volcanoes. They are usually 1,000–4,000 metres (3,000–13,000 ft) in height from the sea floor. 

The peaks are often found hundreds to thousands of metres below the surface, and so are in the deep sea. There are an estimated 100,000 seamounts around the globe, but only a few have been studied. Seamounts come in all shapes and sizes, and follow a distinctive pattern of growth, activity, and death. In recent years, several active seamounts have been observed, for example Loihi seamount in the Hawaiian–Emperor seamount chain.

Over time, the largest seamounts may reach the sea surface. There wave action erodes the summit to form a flat surface.  After they have subsided and sunk below the sea surface such flat-top seamounts are called "guyots" or "tablemounts".

Seamounts are one of the most common oceanic ecosystems in the world. Interactions between seamounts and underwater currents attract plankton, corals, fish, and cetacea alike. Their effect has been noted by the commercial fishing industry, and many seamounts support extensive fisheries. There are concerns about the effect of fishing on seamount ecosystems. There are well-documented cases of stock decline. 95% of ecological damage is done by bottom trawling, which literally scrapes whole ecosystems off seamounts.

Most seamounts are not yet to be studied, or even mapped. Bathymetry and satellite altimetry are two technologies used to collect data. There have been instances where naval vessels have collided with uncharted seamounts. The Muirfield seamount is named after the ship that struck it in 1973. However, the greatest danger from seamounts are flank collapses. As they get older, water eats away at their sides. This causes landslides which, in turn, may cause massive tsunamis.

[[Hazelnut]]

CATEGORIES: Edible nuts and seeds

Hazelnuts are nuts of the hazel genus of tree; they are also called cob nuts and filbert nuts. Filbert nuts are more elongated (twice as long as they are round).

Sibling species are species which look alike, but cannot breed with each other.

The classic case is Drosophila pseudoobscura and D. persimilis. They are almost identical, but if flies from one species are put with flies from the other species, they do not interbreed. Another example was the European mosquito known as Anopheles maculipennis. This turned out to be a cluster of six different species, some of which transmit malaria, and some do not.

[[Planning]]

CATEGORIES: Planning

Planning is the way most organizations work to do big projects. It is thinking about what needs to happen, and then making a detailed plan.

All humans plan to some extent: it is a fundamental property of intelligent behaviour. In big organisations and government planning is a main activity. It combines forecasting  developments with scenarios of how to react to them.

Forecasting is predicting what the future will look like, whereas planning predicts what the future should look like.

The "nuts and bolts" of planning are the documents, diagrams, and meetings, the objectives and the strategy to be followed. Beyond this, planning has a different meaning depending on the context in which it is used.

The counterpart to planning is self-organization, when order emerges spontaneously out of seeming chaos.

[[Gradualism]]

CATEGORIES: Earth sciences, Evolutionary biology, Politics, Planning

Gradualism is a process of change by gradual, slow stages. In politics, it is the opposite of revolutions and rapid change. "Gradualism is... sometimes associated with social democracy".

In geology it is in tune with uniformitarianism, and against catastrophism. In biology it is in tune with Darwinian ideas of slowly changing species as opposed to big, rapid changes

==Politics and society== 

Gradualism is one of the defining features of political liberalism and reformism. It is against abrupt strokes such as revolutions or uprisings. Instead, change ought to be brought about in small, discrete steps.

Martin Luther King, Jr. was opposed to the idea of gradualism as a method of eliminating segregation. The government wanted to try to integrate African-Americans and European-Americans slowly into the same society, but many believed it was a way for the government to put off actually doing anything about racial segregation:

Charles Lindblom was an influential professor and author who believed in muddling through ("incrementalism") as the right way to go. He pointed out the connexions between the political system, the market-place and democratic freedom.

The ROC is also described as the most liberal after over 30,000 people went to the Taiwan Pride parade in 2010 and 2011, making it the largest LGBT event in Asia. On May 17, 2019, the Legislative Yuan approved a bill, submitted by the Executive Yuan, recognising marriage for same-sex couples. The bill was signed into law by President Tsai Ing-wen on 22 May and went into effect on 24 May. Taiwan therefore became the first country in Asia to recognise same-sex marriage.

[[Hotel Mario]]

CATEGORIES: 1994 video games, Puzzle video games, Video game memes

Hotel Mario is a puzzle game developed by Fantasy Factory and published by Philips Interactive Media and Nintendo for the CD-i in 1994. The primary character of the game is Mario, who must find Princess Toadstool by going through seven Koopa hotels in the Mushroom Kingdom. Every hotel is divided into many levels, and what the player must do is close all doors on each level. Killing a Koopaling on the hotel's final level takes the player to the next building. After Nintendo decided not to have Philips create an add-on for the Super NES, they gave Philips permission to use five of their characters in games for Philips' CD-i. There wasn't a lot of time for the games to be developed and there was little funding. The games resulting from the license were widely criticized, with Hotel Mario being known as one of the worst Mario-centered games, due to the animation of the shutting doors, the non-working controls and especially known for the cutscenes that used full motion video. The CD-i was considered a commercial failure and the games became valuable because of their rarity.

[[Premier of South Australia]]

CATEGORIES: Premiers of South Australia

The Premier of South Australia is the head of the South Australian government. They are the leaders of the political party which has a majority of the seats in the Legislative Assembly. Before the 1890s when there was no formal party system in South Australia, politicians usually held liberal or conservative beliefs. The liberals dominated government from 1893 to 1905 with Labor support, with the conservatives mostly in opposition. Labor took government with the support of eight liberals in 1905 when Labor gained more seats than the liberals. The rise of Labor meant the other groups began to become anti-labor parties. The conservatives merged with the Liberal and Democratic Union (formed in 1906) to become the Liberal Union in 1910. No "country" or rural conservative parties have lasted in South Australian state politics. 

Labor formed South Australia's first majority government after winning the 1910 state election. This was two weeks after federal Labor formed Australia's first majority government after winning the 1910 federal election. 

[[Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy]]

CATEGORIES: Ballets by Lev Ivanov, Compositions by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Ballets first performed by the St. Petersburg Imperial Ballet

The "Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy" is a dance for a ballerina. It is the third movement in The Nutcracker pas de deux. This pas de deux is from Act 2 of the 1892 ballet The Nutcracker.  It is danced by the principal female dancer. The number was choreographed by Lev Ivanov to music written by Tchaikovsky. 

Choreographer Marius Petipa wanted the Sugar Plum Fairy's music to sound like "drops of water shooting from a fountain". Tchaikovsky found the ideal instrument to do this job in Paris in 1891. It was then that he came across the recently invented celesta. This instrument looked like a piano. It sounded like bells. Tchaikovsky wrote, "celesta is midway between a tiny piano and a Glockenspiel, with a divinely wonderful sound." He wanted to use the celesta in The Nutcracker. He asked his publisher to buy one. He wanted to keep the purchase a secret. He did not want other Russian composers to "get wind of it and ... use it for unusual effects before me." 

Tchaikovsky  introduced the celesta to Russian music lovers on 19 March 1892 when the Nutcracker Suite was performed for the Russian Musical Society in St. Petersburg. The instrument is forever identified with the Sugar Plum Fairy. It is heard in other parts of Act 2 of The Nutcracker besides the Sugar Plum Fairy's dance. The "Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy" is one of the ballet's best known musical numbers. It is often "jazzed up" for television commercials at Christmas time. 

There is little information about the Sugar Plum Fairy's original choreography. In the first performances the presto at the end of the dance was cut. According to Roland John Wiley, the dance appears to have consisted of short pointe steps, petite batteries, and attitudes in various combinations. He describes the dance as having "a sense of dynamic build up: from delicate angularity ... to circular shapes, to plainer but more virtuoso movementspirouettes to rounds de jambenear the end." 

The first Sugar Plum Fairy was Antonietta Dell'Era. She was a good technician, but Tchaikovsky's brother Modest described her as pudgy and unattractive. Although the Sugar Plum Fairy is the prima ballerina of The Nutcracker, she has very little dancing to do. This was a considered a major defect among early critics. Dell'Era tried to expand the role of the Sugar Plum Fairy in later performances by putting a gavotte by Czibulka into the score.

CATEGORIES: Vascular plants

The Lycopods (Lycopodiophyta or Lycophyta) are the oldest surviving vascular plant division. It is a vascular plant subdivision of the plant kingdom. Its earliest fossils are from 428–410 million years ago.p99

The Lycopods include some of the most primitive (basal) living species. They reproduce by shedding spores and have macroscopic alternation of generations. Members of Lycopodiophyta have a protostele, and the sporophyte generation is dominant.

Lycopods differ from all other vascular plants in having microphylls, leaves that have only a single vein rather than the much more complex megaphylls found in ferns and seed plants.

[[MD5]]

CATEGORIES: Algorithms

MD5 is a special algorithm, a mathematical process, used to make computer information secure and safe. MD5 stands for Message Digest, and was made to replace the MD4 standard. 

It is mainly used for security in database systems. The algorithm generates a unique hash code for every piece of data (strings, text etc.). Any change to the data, either deliberate or accidental, will mean the hash code will also change. By comparing the codes, it is easy to see if a change has been made. MD5 was invented by Ron Rivest of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1991. An MD5 hash code provides a 32-digit hexadecimal number. By 1996, methods were developed to break the security of an MD5 algorithm. This was done by getting another program to make the same hash number for different sets of data. MD5 is no longer considered acceptable for protecting against intentional malicious changes to data, but it is still considered OK to protect from accidental changes, for example single-bit changes caused by noise on a network connection. An MD5 hash could look like: 9c677286866aad38f8e9b660f5411814. This is the hash of the string "Wikipedia".

[[Administrator of the Northern Territory]]

CATEGORIES: Administrators of the Northern Territory, Heads of government of Australian states and territories

The Administrator of the Northern Territory is the person selected by the Governor-General of Australia to act as the governor of the Northern Territory of Australia. The selection of Administrator is made by the Governor-General-in-Council, that is, the Governor-General acting on the advice of the Australian government, not the advice of the Government of the Northern Territory.

The Northern Territory became self-governing on 1 July 1978. Now the Governor-General-in Council accepts a recommendation from the Northern Territory Government. Unlike an Australian State Governor, the Administrator does not represent the Queen in the Territory. They represent the Governor-General who is the Queen's representative in the Commonwealth. The Administrator's role is to govern the Territory under the law which gave it self-government. The Administrator's constitutional role is almost the same as a State Governor and can be considered the Queen's indirect representative in the Territory.

The office of the Deputy of the Administrator was created in 1997.

The present Administrator is Sally Thomas, AM.

[[Septicemic plague]]

CATEGORIES: Plague

Septicemic (or septicaemic) plague is a deadly blood infection. It is one of the three main forms of plague (the other two being the bubonic and penumonic). It is caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis.

Septicemic plague can cause the blood to form small clots through the body. Without treatment it is almost always fatal. The death rate in medieval times was 99-100 percent. Septicemic plague is the rarest of the three plagues that struck Europe in 1348, the other forms are bubonic and pneumonic plague. This disease is caused mainly by the bite of an infected rodent or insect. In rare cases it can also enter the body through an opening in the skin or by cough from another infected human. In septicemic plague the bacteria grow quickly in the blood, causing severe sepsis. The endotoxins cause disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). This is tiny clots of blood throughout the body which stops the blood getting to some areas. This causes the cells in the area to die. DIC uses up the bodies ability to make blood clot, so that it can no longer control bleeding. This means there is bleeding into the skin and other organs, which can cause red and/or black patchy rash and  coughing up or vomiting of blood (hemoptysis/haemoptysis). There are bumps on the skin that look somewhat like insect bites. These bumps are usually red, and sometimes white in the center. Early treatment with antibiotics reduces the death rate to between 4 and 15 percent. People that get this disease must receive treatment in at most 24 hours or they will die. In some cases, people may even die on the same day they get the disease.

[[Titian]]

CATEGORIES: 1490s births, 1576 deaths, 16th century Italian painters

Tiziano Vecellio (sometimes his last name is given as Vecelli, born around 1490, in Pieve di Cadore near Belluno,  died 27 August 1576 in Venice) was an Italian painter. His name in English is Titian. He was one of the leading painters of the 16th century Venetian school; he is also seen as one of the principal artists of High Renaissance painting of the 16th century. When he was alive, he was often called Da Cadore, after his place of birth.

When he was active, the Republic of Venice had a Golden Age, and was well-off economically. Aged nine, Titian went to Venice. The brothers Gentile and Giovanni Bellini taught him how to paint. In 1513, he opened his own shop, and developed into a successful painter, known all over Europe. In 1533, Charles V made him a nobleman. He also obtained a job as a painter at the court of Charles V.  In 1545, Pope Paul III invited him to come to Rome, in 1548 and 1550, Titian accompanied Charles V and his son, Philip II to the Diet of Augsburg. When Titian died of the Plague in the year 1576, he was an old man. He was also one of the most famous painters of Venetian history.

Titian was very productive: in total, he painted 676 works. He did portraits, landscapes, as well as themes from mythology and religious works. All his works are very colorful. This special use of color influenced other painters of the same period a great deal. His works influenced painters such as Peter Paul Rubens, Antoine Watteau and Eugène Delacroix.

The words are from a poem by John Henry Newman.  They are supposed to be the words of a man called Gerontius who is dying.  He imagines what is going to happen to him when he dies: how he will meet God who will judge whether he has been good enough to go to heaven.  The angel speaks to him in the poem.  There is also a priest, and a short solo for the Angel of Agony.  The work is in two parts.  Part I is about 40 minutes long and Part II lasts about an hour.

[[Van der Waals force]]

CATEGORIES: Force, Chemical bonding

In chemistry, the van der Waals force is a type of intermolecular force that attracts molecules together. An intermolecular force is a relatively weak force between molecules. Van der Waals forces are the weakest type of intermolecular force. They are named after the Dutch scientist Johannes Diderik van der Waals (1837–1923).

Negatively charged electrons orbit around molecules or ions. The electrons shift their orbits to create slightly different charges from one end of the molecule to the other as a response to each other. These slight differences are called partial charges, described by using the variables δ- or δ+. 

Van der Walls force is sometimes used loosely to mean for all intermolecular forces. Van der Waals forces are weaker than covalent bonds and usually weaker than hydrogen bonds, but they play a important role in supramolecular chemistry, enzymes, polymer science, nanotechnology, surface science, and condensed matter physics. Van der Waals forces define many properties of organic compounds, including their ability to dissolve.

CATEGORIES: Epidemiology, War

Sanitary epidemiological reconnaissance is a diagnostic method in epidemiology. It has been used in the Soviet Japanese campaign in WWII immediately behind the first echelon of tanks and mechanized vehicles of advancing Soviet army should they encounter any particular contagious disease as withdrawing enemy forces had poisoned many wells and water sources.

The use of sanitary epidemiological reconnaissance or similar practices in the armed forces is mentioned elsewhere. The Polish contingents serving under the UN auspices focused their tasks among others on … sanitary-epidemiological reconnaissance … 

Sanitary epidemiological reconnaissance is a collection and transfer of all data available on sanitary and epidemiological situation of the area of possible deployment and action of armed forces, the same data for the neighbouring and enemy armed forces. The aim for the reconnaissance is to clear up the reasons of the specific disease origin- sources of the infection in extreme situations, including local wars and armed conflicts, the ways of the infection transfer and all factors promoting to the infestation. It should result in revealing of the patients and persons, suspected to the specific disease, their isolation and hospitalization. Mobile equipped group for sanitary epidemiological reconnaissance includes: epidemiologist, specialist on infections, assistant of epidemiologist (bacteriologist- lab assistant), medical orderly (if necessary, the group will include zoologist or parasitologist). After the armed forces have become stationary during wartime and emergency of peace time the sanitary epidemiological reconnaissance turns into sanitary and epidemiological surveillance of vital and communal activity of the armed forces.

In 2010 at The Meeting of the States Parties to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons  and Their Destruction in Geneva 

the sanitary epidemiological reconnaissance was suggested as means for monitoring of infections and parasitic agents and for practical implementation of the International Health Regulations (2005). The aim was to prevent and minimize the consequences of natural outbreaks of dangerous infectious diseases, the treat of alleged use of biological weapons. The sanitary epidemiological reconnaissance will be important in assessing the sanitary-epidemiological situation, organizing and conducting preventive activities, indicating and identifying pathogenic biological agents, suppressing hotbeds of infectious diseases, providing advisory and practical assistance to local health authorities.

Sanitary epidemiological reconnaissance (inspection) or a similar practice and specific indication in the hotbed  should be performed immediately after the receiving of the information about bio-terrorism attack.

[[Bias (textile)]]

CATEGORIES: Woven fabrics

The bias of a piece of woven fabric is at 45 degrees to its warp and weft threads.  Every piece of woven fabric has two biases, at right angles to each other. Fabrics which are not woven, such as felt, do not have a bias.

When cut on the bias, woven fabric is more elastic as well as more fluid in movement, compared to the on-grain direction. This helps many types of garment, such as skirts, dresses and neckties.

The "bias-cut" is a technique used by tailors and dress-makers for cutting cloth. The greater stretch in the bias (diagonal) direction of the fabric, helps it accentuate body lines and curves and drape softly. For example, a full-skirted dress cut on the bias will hang more gracefully or a narrow dress will cling to the figure. 

Bias-cut garments were prominent in haute couture clothes designed by Madeleine Vionnet in the 1920s. It is still used often in both haute couture and high street clothing. In the Middle Ages, before the development of knitting, hose leggings were cut on the bias in order to make them fit better.

[[To each according to his contribution]]

CATEGORIES: Socialism

According to the principle of 'To each according to his contribution', during the transition of a society from capitalism to socialism and then to communism, individuals should be rewarded for the amount they contribute to society. Economists such as David Ricardo (1772-1823) had this idea. Ricardo founded a movement that is known as Ricardian socialism today. Many people in the labour movement had this idea too. Ferdinand Lassalle (1825–1864) and Eugen Dühring (1833-1921) expressed such ideas towards Leon Trotsky. Despite this, Vladimir Lenin was the first person to say that this element is fundamental to Marxist theory.

According to Libertarian socialist thinkers, such as American anarchist Benjamin Tucker, socialism is a system in which the laborer receives the full product of his labor. This eliminates exploitation and unearned income accrued to the capitalist.

The term To each according to his contribution simply means that each worker in a socialist society receives "wages" and benefits according to the quantity and value of the labor that he or she contributed. That way, highly productive workers will receive more wages and benefits than workers of average productivity, and substantially more than workers of low productivity. What is more, the more difficult the job is, the more one is rewarded for the labor contributed. Difficulty can result from factors such as greater training requirement, job intensity or safety hazards. According to Trotsky, the idea is to promote productivity. This is done by creating incentives to work harder, longer, and more productively. In the end, the principle comes from capitalism, but will vanish, according to Marx, as work becomes more automated and enjoyable, and as goods become available in greater quantities.

In capitalism, the means of production are owned by a few people; these people are also known as the bourgeoisie. These people do not produce, but they live off the work others do for them. Socialism can fix this issue, because with socialism, the means of production are owned by all people, they are a common good.

[[Diarchy]]

CATEGORIES: Monarchy, Forms of government

Diarchy (or dyarchy) is a form of government where two people are usually the heads of state. The word comes from the Greek δι- "two elements" and ἀρχή, "rule" (from ἄρχω; -αρχία is a derived suffix). The term duumvirate is a hyponym (from Latin duumvirātus, "male diarchy") but some people use it erroneously for women. Most commonly, the leaders of these diarchys, called diarchs, have the job for life with the position being hereditary. This means the position is given to children or family after the death of the diarch.

Modern examples of Diarchys are Andorra, the Republic of San Marino and the Kingdom of Eswatini.

Historical examples Diarchys are Sparta, The Roman Republic and at one point India

Not all Diarchys have the diarchs as the head of state nor do they necessarily rule for their life. In Andorra for example, the Diarchs are the President of France, an elected, temporary position not passed down to children, as well as the Catholic Bishop of Urgell who is appointed to the position by the Catholic Church. Ancient Sparta had Diarchs who were given the hereditary job for life, but only had roles in the military and religion, not politics. There are numbers of countries in world claiming democratic country / states but in reality are under diarchs.

Isadora Duncan (May 27, 1877 – September 14, 1927) was an American dancer. She was an inspiration for modern dance.

Duncan was born in San Francisco, California. She preferred natural movement, instead of what she called the artificial movements of ballet. Her 'free dance movement' was based on simple, flowing movements of the body. It was inspired by nature, and by ancient Greek sculptures. Costumes were flowing and transparent. Dances involved simple runs, skips and jumps, big gestures and mime.

Duncan was wildly unconventional. A bisexual who had two children but did not marry either of their fathers, she became a communist, and boasted about it. She went to the Soviet Union in 1922, but left in less than two years. At different times she lived in Paris, London and other European cities. She started dance schools in Moscow, Berlin and Paris. The schools did not last long, but Duncan had admirers who have continued her influence to the present day.

[[Scientific revolution]]

CATEGORIES: History of science

The scientific revolution was a time (1550-1700) following the Middle Ages and the Renaissance when many discoveries were made. During this time, new ideas and discoveries fundamentally changed the way people thought; they also forced people to think differently, and started what is called science today. Better printing presses after Johannes Gutenberg's time caused a great rise in publishing. This period roughly lasted from the 16th to the 18th century. 

Galileo Galilei invented kinematics and disproved Aristotle's old theory of gravity. One of his students said he dropped two balls of iron (one weighing one pound, the other a hundred) off the leaning tower of Pisa. The objects fell at the same speed which brought about new methods of thinking in that time period. In 1542, Nicolaus Copernicus published his work On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres, in which he said that not the earth, but the sun was at the center of the universe. This theory is known as Heliocentrism today. In the same year, Andreas Vesalius pubilshed his work  On the Structure of the Human Body. This book is about the anatomy of the human body. 

The philosopher Alexandre Koyré (18921964) first used the term 'scientific revolution'  for this time period.

[[Small shelly fossils]]

CATEGORIES: Fossils, Ediacaran, Cambrian

Small shelly fossils (SSF),  or small shelly fauna, are tiny fossils, many only a few millimetres long. They have a record from the latest stages of the Ediacaran to the early Cambrian period. Almost all are from earlier rocks than more familiar fossils such as trilobites. Most SSFs were preserved by being covered quickly with phosphate. This method of preservation is mainly limited to the later Ediacaran and early Cambrian periods, so the animals that made them may have arisen earlier and continued after this time.

Some of the fossils represent the entire skeletons of small organisms, including the mysterious Cloudina and some snail-like molluscs. However, the bulk of the fossils are fragments or parts of larger organisms, including sponges, molluscs, slug-like halkieriids, brachiopods, echinoderms,  and onychophoran-like organisms that may have been close to the ancestors of arthropods.

One of the early explanations for the appearance of the SSFs – and the evolution of mineralized skeletons – is a sudden increase in the ocean's concentration of calcium. However, many SSFs are made of other minerals, such as silica. The first SSFs appear around the same time as organisms first started burrowing to avoid predation, so it is likely that they represent early steps in an evolutionary arms race between predators and increasingly well-defended prey. Nevertheless it is still true that the animals used minerals that were most easily accessible.

The small size and (usually) broken nature of SSFs makes them difficult to identify and classify. However, they provide evidence for how the main groups of marine invertebrates evolved, and for the pace and pattern of evolution in the Cambrian explosion. They include the earliest known representatives of some modern phyla, and they have the great advantage of presenting a nearly continuous record of early Cambrian organisms whose bodies include hard parts.

[[Charity (practice)]]

CATEGORIES: Altruism

Charity is the act of giving help to those in need of it. It is a humanitarian act. It involves giving money, goods or time and effort to those who need it. It is done without expecting something in return. Giving money or food to poor people is an example of charity. Poor, sick or injured people are generally considered the proper people to whom charity should be given. When such people are not supported, they often begin begging, which is directly asking for help from people they do not know. Others may rely on support from charitable organisations. These organisations collect money and goods and then give them to those in need.

Most charities are concerned with providing basic needs, such as food, water, clothing, health care and shelter. The most common form of charity is donating money. The money is then used to buy these basic needs. However, there are many other actions that may be performed as charity, such as teaching orphans, donating blood, or money to help fund medical research.

Charitable giving can be a responsibility in many religions. This kind of charity is called almsgiving or alms. In Islam, for example, it is called zakat. It is one of the five most important duties of being a Muslim.

[[From each according to his ability, to each according to his need]]

CATEGORIES: Socialism

From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs (or need) is a slogan that Karl Marx made popular in his writing Critique of the Gotha program, published in 1875. The German original is Jeder nach seinen Fähigkeiten, jedem nach seinen Bedürfnissen. According to Marx, once a communist society has been established, it will produce enough goods and services so that everyone's needs can be satisfied.

Even though the phrase is commonly attributed to Marx, he was not the first to use it. The slogan was common within the socialist movement. Louis Blanc first used it in 1839, in "The organization of work".  The origin of this phrasing has also been attributed to the French communist Morelly, who proposed in his 1755 Code of Nature "Sacred and Fundamental Laws that would tear out the roots of vice and of all the evils of a society" including the following:

It is no longer produced by mixing existing kinds of cheeses, but by using a number of ingredients. In many countries, including the US, processed cheese is licensed differently to "real" cheese. American cheese may therefore not be sold as "cheese", but as "processed cheese". 

On the label, the word cheese is often left out, and the product is labeled "American slices", "slices" or similar. Since this kind of processed cheese is very common in the United States, it is often used to refer to all kinds of processed cheese. All the same, the term "American cheese" does have a legal definition in the American Code of Federal Regulations.

[[Islam in Iran]]

CATEGORIES: Islam by country, Iranian culture

The Islamic conquest of Persia (637-651) led to the end of the Sassanid Empire and the eventual decline of the Zoroastrian religion in Persia. However, the achievements of the previous Persian civilizations were not lost, but were to a great extent absorbed by the new Islamic polity. Islam has been the official religion of Iran since then, except short duration after Mongol raid and establishment of Ilkhanate. Iran became an Islamic republic after the Islamic Revolution of 1979.

Before the Islamic conquest, the Persians had been mainly Zoroastrian, however, there were also large and thriving Christian and Jewish communities. Eastern Iran (what is now Afghanistan) was predominantly Buddhist. There was a slow but steady movement of the population toward Islam. When Islam was introduced to Iranians, the nobility and city-dwellers were the first to convert, Islam spread more slowly among the peasantry and the dihqans, or landed gentry. By the late 11th century, the majority of Persians had become Muslim, at least nominally.

Though Iran is known today as a stronghold of the Shi'a Muslim faith, it did not become so until much later, around the 15th century. The Safavid dynasty made Shi'a Islam the official state religion in the early sixteenth century and aggressively proselytized on its behalf. It is also believed that by the mid-seventeenth century most people in Iran had become Shi'as, an affiliation that has continued. Over the following centuries, with the state-fostered rise of a Persian-based Shi'ite clergy, a synthesis was formed between Persian culture and Shi'ite Islam that marked each indelibly with the tincture of the other.

Nowadays Islam is the religion of 98% of Iranians, approximately 90% of Iranians are Shi'a and 8% are Sunni, mostly Turkomen, a minority of Arabs (mainly in Hormozgan Province), Baluchs, and Kurds living in the south, southeast, northeast and northwest. Almost all of Iranian Shi'as are Twelvers.

[[Lactarius torminosus]]

CATEGORIES: Fungi

Lactarius torminosus, commonly known as the woolly milkcap or the bearded milkcap, is a mushroom in the genus Lactarius. It is a common and widely distributed fungus, found in North Africa, northern Asia, Northern Europe, and North America. L. torminosus associates with various trees, most commonly birch, and the mushrooms grow on the ground singly or in groups in mixed forests.  Although it is valued for its peppery flavor and eaten after suitable preparation in Russia and Finland, it is highly irritating to the digestive system when eaten raw. The toxins responsible for the acrid taste are destroyed by cooking.

The caps of L. torminosus mushrooms are convex with a central depression, and attain a diameter of up to 10. Its color is a blend of pink and ochre hues, sometimes with circular zones of darker shades. The edge of the cap is rolled inwards, and shaggy when young. On the underside of the caps are narrow flesh-colored gills crowded closely together. It is on these fertile gill surfaces that the spore-bearing cells, the basidia are found. The cylindrical stem is a pale flesh color with a downy surface, reaching a length of up to 8 and a thickness of 0.6. When cut or injured, the fruit bodies ooze a white latex that does not change color upon exposure to air. The variety normandensis, in contrast, has latex that changes from white to yellow.

[[Island of stability]]

CATEGORIES: Physics

The chemical elements beyond lead are radioactive, and they do not have stable isotopes. This means that they will decay into other elements. Except for Plutonium, their half life is in the order of several minutes, to seconds. There is a theory in physics that says that after a number of elements with short half lives, there will be others with longer half lives. These are generally known as Islands of stability. These elements are expected to have isotopes with half lives in the range of several minutes. The hypothesis is that the atomic nucleus is built up in "shells" in a manner similar to the structure of the much larger electron shells in atoms. In both cases, shells are just groups of quantum energy levels that are relatively close to each other. Energy levels from quantum states in two different shells will be separated by a relatively large energy gap. So when the number of neutrons and protons completely fills the energy levels of a given shell in the nucleus, the binding energy per nucleon will reach a local maximum and thus that particular configuration will have a longer lifetime than nearby isotopes that do not possess filled shells.

A filled shell would have "magic numbers" of neutrons and protons. One possible magic number of neutrons for spherical nuclei is 184, and some possible matching proton numbers are 114, 120 and 126 – which would mean that the most stable spherical isotopes would be flerovium-298, unbinilium-304 and unbihexium-310. Of particular note is Ubh-310, which would be "doubly magic" (both its proton number of 126 and neutron number of 184 are thought to be magic) and thus the most likely to have a very long half-life. (The next lighter doubly magic spherical nucleus is lead-208, the heaviest stable nucleus and most stable heavy metal.)

Recent research indicates that large nuclei are deformed, causing magic numbers to shift. Hassium-270 is now believed to be a doubly magic deformed nucleus, with deformed magic numbers 108 and 162. However, it has a half-life of only 3.6 seconds.

Isotopes have been produced with enough protons to plant them upon an island of stability but with too few neutrons to even place them upon the island's outer "shores". It is possible that these elements possess unusual chemical properties and, if they have isotopes with adequate lifespans, would be available for various practical applications (such as particle accelerator targets and as neutron sources as well).

[[French colonial empire]]

CATEGORIES: History of France, Overseas empires, Colonialism, 1534 establishments, 1946 disestablishments

The French colonial Empire was land controlled by the French from the 17th century to the late 1960s. In the 17th and 18th centuries France gained and lost large territories in North America and India. Like the other empires of the time, was powered by slaves captured from Africa. The Haitian Revolution, when many of these slaves in the colony of Saint Domingue fought and defeated the French, caused major changes in the empire.

Sometimes, people say there was a first and a second French colonial empire. The "first colonial empire" was from the French colonization of the Americas to the Napoleonic Wars. The "second colonial empire" is the French colonies in Africa.

From the 16th to the 17th centuries, the First French colonial empire stretched from a total area at its peak in 1680 to over 10,000,000 square kilometres (3,900,000 sq mi), the second largest empire in the world at the time behind only the Spanish Empire. In terms of land area, the Second French colonial empire extended to over 13,500,000 square kilometres (5,200,000 sq mi) at its peak in 1936, the second largest in the world at the time, which accounted for 10% of the world's land area.

[[Wet Tropics of Queensland]]

CATEGORIES: World Heritage Sites in Australia, Geography of Queensland, Australian National Heritage List

The Wet Tropics of Queensland is a UNESCO World Heritage Site which has the oldest continuously surviving tropical rainforests on Earth. The forests date from the Mesozoic era when the climate of Australia (and the world) was much more tropical than today. Originally, the rain forest area covered a much wider area than today. Today it is just a narrow strip along the east coast of Queensland. It starts just north of Townsville and continues to just south of Cooktown, a distance of about 450. 

The wet tropics cover an area of 894420 in 730 separate blocks of land. It includes 41 national parks covering185000. About 80% of the site is tropical rainforest. It is interesting because it is very old forest, and is a living record of 415 million years of evolution, going back to Pangea and Gondwana. All of Australia's marsupials, and many of its other animals, evolved in tropical rainforests, and many of their closest surviving ancestors still live in the Wet Tropics of Queensland.

[[Rheumatoid arthritis]]

CATEGORIES: Inflammation, Diseases and disorders of joints, Rheumatology

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a serious, painful, and chronic (long-lasting) disease.  It is an autoimmune disease - a disease where the body's immune system attacks healthy cells.  When a person has RA, their immune system attacks the joints and the tissues around the joints in the body.  This causes different problems, like:

Eventually, RA can destroy a person's articular cartilage.  Normally, articular (having to do with the joints) cartilage covers the end of bones where they come together to form joints.  This keeps the bones from rubbing against each other.  If the articular cartilage has been destroyed by RA, the bones will rub against each other, which is very painful.

No one knows what causes RA, but some theories are that it has to do with hormones, environment, infection and genes. There is no cure, but doctors have determined ways to help slow down and reduce the impact of the disease. Women are two to three times as likely as men to get rheumatoid arthritis. Most cases of RA occur in people between the ages of 25 and 55.

RA was first recognized around 1800 by Dr. Augustin Jacob Landré-Beauvais.

[[Sloth (deadly sin)]]

CATEGORIES: Seven deadly sins

In Christianity, Sloth is about a person not wanting to work, because of lack of motivation. The person will be physically inactive and neglect what God has said. Very often, this will lead to resources being wasted. As an example, sloth is about a person not helping those in need, even though they would be able to. Sloth is one of the seven capital sins, which are also called seven deadly sins.

For Protestants, Diligence (or hard work) is one of the ways to please God. Max Weber (1864-1920) treats this in his work The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism. In his work "Anthropologie in pragmatischer Hinsicht", Immanuel Kant stated that of the capital sins sloth, cowardice and falsehood, the first one is the most despicable. However, he also sees this as a measure of self-protection of the individual, as long phases of hard work will lead a person to become tired, and to make short pauses between intervals of work. Without these pauses, the restles malice that is in the world would do a far greater amount of damage. In 1846, Louis Blanc wrote about the right to work. There was a financial crisis at the time, and many people were unemployed. The crisis led to the French Revolution of 1848.

In 1880, the Socialist Paul Lafargue  published an essay called The Right to be Lazy, where he explains that the worker should have a right to be lazy.

Joe and Scott are renowned for not only there flamboyant appearances, but acrobatic manoeuvres

The original Hardy Boys Mystery Stories series ended in 2005. Some stories were adapted for television programs.

[[List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita]]

CATEGORIES: GDP-related lists of countries

This is a list of countries of the world sorted by their gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. GDP per capita is a measurement used to determine economic growth and potential increases in productivity and is calculated by taking the GDP and dividing it by the total population in the country. It is used to describe the standard of living of a population, with a higher gross domestic product per capita country ranking a higher standard of living is possible for its population. Although GDP per capita is an important and widely used indicator of countries’ level of economic welfare, "consumption per capita" may be more useful for comparing the relative welfare of consumers across various countries. GDP is the worth of all goods and services made in a country in a year. PPP is for purchasing power parity and it means how much money would be needed to buy the same item in two different countries. Per capita consumption is the yearly use of goods and services by each person. Per capita means per person.

"There dwelt a Nymph, not up for hunting or archery:

unfit for footraces. She the only Naiad not in Diana’s band.

Often her sisters would say: “Pick up a javelin, or

bristling quiver, and interrupt your leisure for the chase!

But she would not pick up a javelin or arrows,

nor trade leisure for the chase.

Instead she would bathe her beautiful limbs and tend to her hair,

with her waters as a mirror."

Ovid, Metamorphoses. Book IV, 306-312.

According to Ovid's myth, she fell in love with Hermaphroditus, the son of Hermes and Aphrodite. When he bathed in her spring, she embraced him and prayed to the gods to be united with him forever, the gods heard her prayer and merged their bodies together, transforming Hermaphroditus into an androgynous being.

CATEGORIES: Territorial disputes, Egypt, Sudan

The Hala'ib Triangle (مثلث حلايب  in Arabic, transliterated Muthāllath Ḥalāʾib) is an area of land measuring 20580 located on the Red Sea's African coast. The area, which is named after the town of Hala'ib, is created by the difference in the Egypt–Sudan border between the "political boundary" set in 1899 by the Anglo-Egyptian Condominium, which runs along the 22nd parallel north, and the "administrative boundary" set by the British in 1902, which gave an area of land north of the line to Sudan.  When Sudan became independent in 1956, both Egypt and Sudan claimed sovereignty over the area. After Egypt sent military units to the Hala'ib Triangle in the 1990s, Egypt has controlled the area as part of the Red Sea Governorate, and has been actively investing in it.

The area is not shaped like a triangle—it is actually a complicated polygon. Only the southern 290 border is a straight line. A smaller area, called Bir Tawil, touches the Hala'ib Triangle at its westernmost point. Bir Tawil is not claimed by either Sudan or Egypt.

[[Cesarean section]]

CATEGORIES: Surgery, Biological reproduction

A Cesarean section (often called a C-section) is a kind of surgery, which is usually done to make childbirth easier. In the past, this was done when there was a great risk to the health of the mother, or when normal childbirth through the vagina was not possible. More recently, it has also been done on request, without these reasons. In very rare cases, abortions are performed using this procedure, these are called Hysterotomy abortions. The first person to perform a modern Cesarean section was Ferdinand Adolf Kehrer, in 1881. In Latin, it is called Sectio caesarea, in English, the spelling Caesarean section also exists. 

The rate of babies delivered through Cesarean section varies: It is at a record level of 46% in China; levels of 25% and above are common in many Asian and European countries, Latin America, and the United States.

From about the 6th century, there  was Roman law that stated that a living foetus may not be buried with the mother, The Digest notes this to be a "lex regia". If this were the case, it would date from the time around 700 BC, when there were Roman kings.

[[Priapus]]

CATEGORIES: Greek gods and goddesses

Priapus was a minor fertility god in Greek mythology, who was also the protector of livestock, fruit plants, and male genitals. He was depicted as having an oversized and permanent erection. Sources differ as to who his parents were. Some say he was the son of the god Dionysus and the goddess Aphrodite; Dionysus and Chione; Hermes and Aphrodite; Zeus and Aphrodite; or Pan and Aphrodite. According to the myth, Hera cursed him while he was still in the womb of Aphrodite, because she was jealous that the Trojan prince Paris had picked Aphrodite as being the most beautiful of the goddesses and had given the Golden Apple of Eris to her. Hera's curse made Priapus impotent, ugly and foul-minded. The gods did not want Priapus to live with them on Olympus, and he was left on a hillside on Earth. There, he was taken by shepherds who raised him. Priapus later tried to rape the goddess Hestia, but was hit by a donkey, and this caused Priapus to lose his erection.

He also became the patron god of merchant sailing, protecting and guiding them through rough seas. It was common for merchants to carry a Priapus figure or a phallus on their ships as protection.

[[Planaria]]

CATEGORIES: Flatworms

Planaria is a small aquatic genus of flatworm. The term is also used for other similar flatworms. They are fresh water animals which move in a smooth wave-like manner. Planaria are free-living. They can live in fresh water or very damp soil, depending on the type. 

Planaria are hermaphrodite: they produce both eggs and sperm. To reproduce, a planarian releases eggs and sperm into the water, where the eggs get fertilized. Planaria can repair damage by regenerating any part of their body. 

Planaria are the one of most simple creatures to develop a nervous system. Their nervous system consists of  ganglia under the eyespots and a cord of nerves that run down the body, under the gut (ventral nerve cord). The three pairs of ganglia under the eyespots make a inverted U shape that have nerves sticking out to the outside of the head so that the head of the planarian is more sensitive than the rest of the body. If the light hits the animal near the eyespots, they usually move away into darker water. 

The digestive system of Planaria consist of a mouth a pharynx and a gut cavity. Its mouth is on the underside of the body. Digestive enzymes are released from the mouth onto the food to soften it, Then the half digested food is sucked up the pharynx and into the stomach. From there the nutrients diffuse into the rest of the body. 

There are no circulatory or respiratory systems. Oxygen enters and carbon dioxide leaves the planarian's body by diffusing through the body wall. Planaria do not have a skeleton. They have an extendable crumpled muscle that allows them to move.  Also, planarians have three layers of body-wall muscles that are constructed of circular muscle fibers as well as longer muscle threads.

Planarians have both ovaries and testes. To reproduce, they can have sex with another planarian; this is called sexual reproduction. Another way planarians reproduce is called asexual reproduction. This is when a planarian splits and regenerates the parts that are missing. However, asexual reproduction is uncommon.

The 26th of July Movement was the name of the political party led by Fidel Castro during the Cuban Revolution. In Spanish, it is called Movimiento 26 de Julio, it is often abbreviated M-26-7. The name comes from the date of the attack on the Moncada Barracks, in Santiago de Cuba, which was carried out on 26th July 1953. The participants were condemned to long prison terms, but were freed at an amnesty in 1955. After this, they formed the movement. Their strategy was armed resistance, in small cells, that were spread all over the country, and were kept secret. Frank País was made the leader of the resistance in Cuba, other activists were Raúl Pujol, Celia Sánchez, Haydée Santamaría, Aldo Santamaría and Vilma Espín.

Fidel castro and other Moncadistas went into exile. Castro went to Mexico, where he met Ernesto Guevara. In 1956, Fidel and Raul Castro, Juan Almeida Bosque, Ramiro Valdés Menéndez, Guevara, and Camilo Cienfuegos went back to Cuba to support the cells there. After two years of guerilla fighting, Fulgencio Batista fled from Cuba, in 1959. 

Until the fall of Batista, the forces did not have a Marxist ideology, rather they were different people collaborating to overturn the Batista regime. Later they started to work together with the Communist Party of Cuba. In 1961, they merged with the Communist Party.

In some cases, they also stick together in the bloodstream, and form blood clots. Such blood clots cause Strokes and Heart attacks. Another type of drug that prevents clotting is called anticoagulant. Anticoagulants cannot be used to prevent blood clotting in the arteries. Antiplatelet drugs are commonly used in the prevention of strokes and heart attacks. Acetylsalicylic acid, commonly known as Aspirin, is one of them.

CATEGORIES: Villages in Shropshire

Coalbrookdale is a village in the Ironbridge Gorge in Shropshire, England. It is in an area of great significance in the history of industrialisation. This is where iron ore was first smelted by Abraham Darby using easily mined "coking coal".

The coal was drawn from drift mines in the sides of the valley. As it contained far fewer impurities than normal coal, the iron it produced was of a superior quality. Along with many other industrial developments that were going on in other parts of the country, this discovery was a major factor in the growing industrialisation of Britain. It was the Industrial Revolution.

Today, Coalbrookdale is home to the Ironbridge Institute, a partnership between the University of Birmingham and the Ironbridge Gorge Museum Trust offering postgraduate and professional courses in heritage.

[[Drosophila simulans]]

CATEGORIES: Drosophila

Drosophila simulans is a species of fruit fly closely related to D. melanogaster 

It was discovered by the fly geneticist Alfred Sturtevant in 1919, when he noticed that the flies used in Thomas Hunt Morgan's laboratory at the Columbia University were actually two distinct species: D. melanogaster and D. simulans. Males differ in the external genitalia, while trained observers can separate females using colour characteristics. 

D. melanogaster females crossed to D. simulans males produce sterile F1 females and no F1 males. The reciprocal cross produces sterile F1 males and no female progeny.

D. simulans was found later to be closely related to two island endemics, Drosophila sechellia and Drosophila mauritiana. D. simulans will mate with these sister species to form fertile females and sterile males, a fact that has made D. simulans an important model organism for research into speciation.

The body structure is fairly constant. A thick cuticle gives protection, and acts as a kind of hydrostatic skeleton. Caenorhabditis elegans has had its genetics studied intensively, and had its genome analysed in 1998. DNA sequence analysis of nematodes is quite advanced, including trees of species relationship.

Cell numbers in the organs are constant within a species. Nematodes have a fixed, genetically determined number of cells, a phenomenon known as eutely. The male C. elegans has 1031 cells, a number which does not change after cell division stops at the end of the larval period. Growth is solely due to an increase in the size of individual cells.

[[Ichneumon]]

CATEGORIES: Parasitoids, Wasps

The Ichneumonoidea are parasitoid wasps. They are a superfamily in the suborder Apocrita.

The superfamily is made up of the ichneumon wasps, (family Ichneumonidae), and the braconids (family Braconidae). The superfamily contains well over 80,000 different species. Members of the family Ichneumonidae are usually larger than members of the Braconidae, and the family has three times as many species as the braconids. The two families are distinguished mainly by details of wing venation.

Almost all are solitary insects, and most are parasitoids—the larvae feeding on or in another insect which finally dies. Being in the same order, ichneumonoids are closely related to other hymenoptera such as ants and bees. Many species in both families use polydnaviruses (with double strand DNA) to suppress the immune system of the host insect.

Some species use many different insects as hosts, others are very specific in host choice. Various ichneumons are used successfully as biological control agents in controlling pests such as flies or beetles.

Ichneumon wasp species are highly varied, ranging from 3 to 130 long. Most are slender, with the females of many species (particularly in the genus Megarhyssa) having an extremely long ovipositor for laying eggs. The female finds a host and lays an egg on, near, or inside the host's body. Upon hatching, the larval ichneumon feeds either externally or internally, killing the host when they themselves are ready to pupate. Despite looking formidable, the ovipositor does not deliver a sting like many wasps or bees. It can be used by the wasps to bore through rotten wood, and lay eggs in grubs hiding under the wood.

[[Information asymmetry]]

CATEGORIES: Market failure

Information asymmetry is a concept in economics and contract theory. It says that in any given contract the two parties of the contract do not have the same information.

Neoclassical economics assumes there is perfect information: all the actors know all the states of their environment; they can also observe what all the other actors do. Information is free -it has no cost in the economic sense. This is also true for the ability to observe the other parties.

[[Substitute good]]

CATEGORIES: Microeconomics, Goods

In economics two or more goods can be classified by looking at the demand curve when the price of one of these goods changes. That way they will either be classified as substitutes or complementary goods. Two goods are substitutes if the demand of one good increases and the price of the other good increases. In this case, consumers will replace one good with the other. 

Classic examples of substitute goods include margarine and butter, or tea and coffee. Substitute goods not only occur on the consumer side of the market but also the producer side. Substitutable producer goods would include: petroleum and natural gas (used for heating or electricity). The fact that one good is substitutable for another has immediate economic consequences: insofar as one good can be substituted for another, the demand for the two kinds of good will be bound together by the fact that customers can trade off one good for the other if they get an advantage by to do so.

Perfect substitutes can replace each other, without trade-off in costs, or quality. For imperfect substitutes, the customer has to make a trade-off, either in price, or in quality. Artificial leather is much cheaper than real leather, and can replace it in many situations - artificial and real leather are substitute goods. Real leather is much more durable, and has a different look and feel. When these factors are important, the two are not interchangeable. For this reason artificial and real leather are imperfect substitutes.

[[Complementary good]]

CATEGORIES: Microeconomics

In microeconomics, complementary goods are goods whose utility is increased if they are consumed together. This means that the demand curve for both goods will move in the same direction, if the price changes. If the demand curve does not change in the same direction, in case of a price change, the goods are substitute goods.

[[Kepler conjecture]]

CATEGORIES: Mathematics

The Kepler conjecture is a problem in math. It wants to know the best way to put spheres together so there will be only a little bit of room between the spheres. That means the spheres are put together very tightly, meaning they are dense.  

[[Sphere packing]]

CATEGORIES: Geometry

In geometry, Sphere packing refers to a number of problems that try to arrange spheres in space. Very often, the spheres all have the same size, and the space used is usually three-dimensional Euclidean space. The problem is part of packing problems. When it is generalised, not all the spheres need to have the same size, and spaces can be n-dimensional Euclidean space, or hyperbolic space.

A typical sphere packing problem is to find an arrangement in which the spheres fill as large a proportion of the space as possible. The proportion of space filled by the spheres is called the density of the arrangement. As the local density of a packing in an infinite space can vary depending on the volume over which it is measured, the problem is usually to maximise the average or asymptotic density, measured over a large enough volume.

founders of "the French school of air navigation" with everything

it has scientific expertise, know-how

technological and operational experience. He quickly understood

that France could and should play a leading role in this

sector, because of its aviation history, its ability to

train highly qualified specialists, but also its global ambitions

and European geography. He retained confident until the end that we could provide leadership in technical

international level, I am reminded of conversations with him on this

subject. The best tribute to him is certainly to continue

in this way."

[[Algebraic equation]]

In mathematics, an algebraic equation, also called polynomial equation over a given field is an equation of the form

where P and Q are polynomials over that field, and have one (univariate) or more than one (multivariate) variables. For example:

is an algebraic equation over the rational numbers.

If an algebraic equation is over the rationals, it can always be converted to an equivalent one, where all the coefficients are integers. For example, in the equation given above, we multiply by 42 = 2·3·7 and group the terms in the first member. The equation is converted to

The solutions of an equation are the values of the variables for which the equation is true. But for algebraic equations there are also called roots. When solving an equation, we need to say in which set the solutions are allowed. For example, for an equation over the rationals, one can find solutions in the integers.  Then, the equation is a diophantine equation. One may also look for solutions in the field of complex numbers. One can also look for solutions in real numbers.

[[Algebraic solution]]

[[Derivative (finance)]]

CATEGORIES: Finance

In finance, a derivative is a special type of contract. In it, the two parties agree to sell (or to buy) certain goods, at a given price, on a given date. Derivatives can be used in two ways. The first is called speculation: One party hopes that the market price differs from the price agreed upon in the contract, so that he can make the difference between the two. The second is called hedging: One party wants to make sure that the market price doesn't go in a direction that would hurt his profits, so he make sure that the price is agreed upon a long time before the transaction takes place. For a seller, hedging means that he can be certain to receive the agreed upon price, and for the buyer hedging means that he can be certain not to pay more than the agreed upon price. From a moral point of view, speculation is considered a negative activity.

One of the oldest derivatives is rice futures, which have been traded on the Dojima Rice Exchange since the eighteenth century.

Derivatives can take many forms but some of the most common types are Futures, Contracts for Difference and Options. They can also be structured on a range of different assets including Forex, Equities, Commodities and interest rates.

[[Denying the correlative]]

CATEGORIES: Logical fallacies

Denying the correlative is a mistake in logic where a person tries to create a third possibility where there are only two. It is based on the concept of correlative conjunctions, pairs of statements where one statement must be true and the other must be false. For example 1. Ginger is a cat. 2. Ginger is not a cat. If a person claims that Ginger is something else than a cat or not a cat, then he is making a logically impossible claim, and denying the correlative. It is the opposite of the false dilemma, which tries to reduce options to only two. Another is if a person were asked if he killed someone and said, "I fought with him". That does not answer the question.

[[False dilemma]]

CATEGORIES: Logical fallacies

False dilemma, also called the either-or fallacy, us vs. them fallacy, black-or-white fallacy, false dichotomy, or the fallacy of false choice, is a mistake in logic that allows only two possibilities when more than two exist.

For example, there is "either-or fallacy" in saying that an apple must be green or red.  The premise is that the apple is either one color or another; but this beginning is a mistake because some apples—not most—are other colors.  In other words, most apples are red or green, but some are also yellow.

A "fallacy of false choice" may hide a deliberate attempt to eliminate agreement on an issue. Eldridge Cleaver used this tactic when he said: "You're either part of the solution or part of the problem."

A false dilemma may also be used for comedic effect.  Stephen Colbert used this tactic when he asked guests on The Colbert Report: "George Bush... great president or the greatest president?"

[[Pato]]

CATEGORIES: Sport in Argentina, Equestrian sports

Pato is a game played on horseback.  It adds ideas from polo and basketball. It is the national sport of Argentina.

Pato was banned several times during its history.  This was due to the violence—not only to the duck; many gauchos were trampled underfoot.  Some lost their lives in knife fights started in the heat of the game. In 1796, a Catholic priest said that pato players who died this way should not get Christian burial. Laws saying people could not play pato were common in the 19th century.

During the 1930s, pato had rules added by ranch owner Alberto del Castillo Posse.  He made a set of rules based on modern polo. President Juan Perón made pato Argentina's national game in 1953.

Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender (LGBT) people in Myanmar face legal challenges and discrimination not experienced by non-LGBT residents. Same-sex sexual activity is illegal within the Union of Myanmar and punishable by fines and imprisonment for ten years to life. The past authoritarian nature of the government made it difficult to obtain accurate information about the legal or social status of LGBT citizens of Myanmar. However, along with the ongoing political reforms, improvements in media and civil freedoms have allowed LGBT people to gain more and more recognition in the country.

During the Military regime, no organised Bangladeshi LGBT political or social life was able to exist. Burma's social mores about human sexuality have been described as being "extremely conservative." Aung Myo Min is an openly gay man and has been involved in the All Burma Students Democratic Front (ABSDF). In 2005 he talked about his coming out process and the homophobia that exists, even with the pro-democracy opposition. Today he is involved with exile Burma human rights organizations, including the Campaign for Lesbian Gay Rights in Burma. In 2003, Focus Asia (Star TV) aired a story about the Nat Kadaws. The "Utopia Guide to Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar & Vietnam" references "Transgender shaman channelling spirits at Myanmar sacred festivals." Yet, within Burma itself, no formal gay bars or LGBT human rights organisations exist as of yet. There are only some unconfirmed reports that certain nightclubs in the cities that are a reputation for both heterosexual and LGBT clientele. Burma also celebrated its first gay pride in several cities around the country in 2012, to mark the International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia and Transphobia.

[[U.S. state]]

CATEGORIES: States of the United States

In the United States, a state is a political entity. There are currently 50 of them, and they are bound together in a federation.  Each has a government and can make laws over a particular area that the state covers. All states have a shared sovereignty with the U.S. federal government. People who were born or naturalized in states are citizens of both the United States and the state they are in.  People can move between states without asking or saying so, unless a court has said they can't.  Four states call themselves "commonwealths" in their official names.  Washington, D.C. is a federal district and not a state nor in a state.

States divide their territory into counties, or something similar with different name, which are not sovereign.  Most states give their counties some government authority; a few states give them none.  State governments get their power from the people of that state.  States have a number of States' rights under the United States Constitution.  States and the people that live in them are represented in the United States Congress in the Senate and House of Representatives.  Each state also selects electors (an equal number to the number of Senators and Representatives from that state) to vote in the Electoral College, which elects the President of the United States. Puerto Rico a territory of the United States is considered as a possible 51st state for the future.

CATEGORIES: Ancient Armenia, Ancient history of Azerbaijan, Former empires, History of Armenia, History of Georgia (country), History of Iran, History of Iraq, History of Syria, History of Turkey, 4th-century BC establishments, 5th-century disestablishments

The ancient Kingdom of Armenia was an independent monarchy from 331 BC to AD 428. When the kingdom was the most powerful it was also called the "Armenian Empire".

After the fall of the Achaemenid Empire, the former Satrapy of Armenia was divided in about 120 clan territories.  After the destruction of the Seleucid Empire, a Helenistic Greek successor state of Alexander the Great's short-lived empire, a Hellenistic Armenian state was founded in 190 BC by Artaxias I.  At its height, from 95 to 66 BC, Armenia extended its rule through areas of the Caucasus and the area that is now eastern Turkey, Syria and Lebanon. Armenia was one of the weakest states in the Roman East. It was under the Roman sphere of influence in 66 BC.

Armenia reached its greatest size and influence under King Tigranes II.  It went from the Mediterranean Sea northeast to the Kura River. The Artaxiads were overthrown by the Romans in AD 12.  This started a period of civil war.  After AD 54, the kingdom was ruled by the Arsacid Dynasty. In AD 387, Armenia was divided into Byzantine Armenia in the west and Persian Armenia in the east. Persian Armenia remained under the rule of Arsacid client kings until AD 428.

William Lawson (2 June 1774 – 16 June 1850) was an explorer of New South Wales, Australia.  He helped discover a passage inland through the Blue Mountains from Sydney.

Lawson was born in Finchley, Middlesex, England.  He is the son of Scottish parents. Lawson came to Sydney as an ensign with the New South Wales Corps in November 1800.  He was soon posted to Norfolk Island.

After 1808, Lawson was appointed aide-de-camp to George Johnston.  He was given 500 acres (2 km²) at Prospect. He built a 40-room mansion there.

In 1813 Lawson, with Gregory Blaxland and William Wentworth, led a trip west from Sydney to cross the Blue Mountains. 

They left on 11 May 1813 with four servants, five dogs and four horses. The route they travelled is still the one used by travellers today. On 31 May 1813 they reached Mount Blaxland and could see the plains to the west. 

Lawson was rewarded with a grant of 1,000 acres (4 km²) of land.  He ended up one of the largest land-holders in Australia. He was made a magistrate and was appointed commandant at Newcastle. 

In 1819 Governor Lachlan Macquarie made a new settlement, Bathurst.  He made Lawson commander of the Bathurst settlement.  Lawson had this job until 1823. From Bathurst, Lawson explored as far north as Mudgee. 

After leaving the army, Lawson was a member of the New South Wales Legislative Council from 1843 to 1848. He died at Veteran Hall on 16 June 1850.  The town of Lawson in the Blue Mountains is named for him.

[[Battleship]]

CATEGORIES: Warships

A battleship is a kind of large warship. It has metal armour and has large (heavy caliber) guns. Battleships are larger, better armed and armored than cruisers and destroyers. Battleships were mainly around from about 1880 to the 1940s, though some were still used as late as the Gulf War in 1991. For most of this time, battleships were the most powerful and most expensive kind of warship. Today some battleships are still around but these are museums.

In the 19th century, different countries tried to build bigger and better warships. One of the first ships with iron armor was called Gloire, from 1859. This ship had both sails and a steam engine which drove a propellor, as well as guns the fired explosive shells. This was a kind of ship called an ironclad. A few years later, ironclads were used in the American Civil War.

Britain and France kept trying to build warships that were better than each other. Later in the 19th century other countries like Germany, Russia, Japan, Italy and the United States also built many battleships. Different countries used new inventions to make their ships more powerful, with things like steel armour, rifled guns, and better kinds of steam engine. By around 1890 people started to call their best ships 'battleships' instead of 'ironclads'. Many people, including many Admirals and politicians, thought battleships were very important. If there was a war, the country with the best battleships would win, by sinking the other side's navy and stopping them bringing food and goods into their country (called a blockade). But battleships were also very expensive, and other people thought it was better to spend the money on a better army, or things like pensions for old people. 

In 1906, Britain made a new kind of battleship called HMS Dreadnought. Though this ship was not much bigger, it had steam turbine engines which made it faster. All of its guns were also very large, which meant it could damage other battleships more from further away. People claimed one ship like Dreadnought could beat two earlier battleships, even battleships made just a few years before. Soon many countries were building ships like this, and calling them 'Dreadnoughts'.

Many battleships were used in the First World War. However, battleships were so important and expensive that neither side wanted to take a chance of losing a battle with them. There were several battles with battleships. The biggest one was the Battle of Jutland which involved dozens of battleships and hundreds of smaller ships. But none of the battles made much difference. Submarines made a bigger difference to the war, even though less people had expected them to. At the end of the War, Germany was made to hand over all their battleships to Britain. However, the German navy sank ("scuttled") their own battleships rather than give them to the British. In 1922, most countries which had big navies signed a treaty called the Washington Naval Treaty which meant no-one would build new battleships for at least 10 years.

Battleships were also important at the start of World War II. But by the middle of World War II, battleships had become less important than aircraft carriers. Aircraft carriers had dozens of airplanes which could drop bombs or torpedos. Even though battleships had thicker armour than ever, several hits from bombs or torpedos would still sink a battleship. The planes could fly much further than a battleship's guns could shoot. There were some important battles between battleships in World War II, but more often battleships were less important than aircraft carriers. At battles like the Battle of Taranto and the Battle of Pearl Harbour many battleships were sunk by planes.

After World War II there was not much point to a battleship. Aircraft carriers had become even better, because of jet aircraft and missiles. Also, even a heavily armored battleship could be sunk by a nuclear bomb. Even so the United States Navy kept a few battleships during the Cold War. The very big guns on a battleship were still useful to shoot at shore targets if there was an invasion from the sea. American battleships were also given new weapons like guided missiles to make them more useful if there was a war with Russia. However, only the United States could afford to keep battleships like this. No-one else did. Some American battleships shot at Iraq in the Gulf War. This was the last time when any battleships fought. The United States kept battleships until 2004, when the last ones were made into museums.

William Ray Guy (born December 22, 1949) is a retired American football punter for the Oakland/Los Angeles Raiders. Coming from the University of Southern Mississippi, he was the only pure punter ever to be selected in the first round of the NFL Draft when the Oakland Raiders selected him in 1973. He won three Super Bowls with the Oakland Raiders also.

On August 2, 2014, Guy was inducted to the Pro Football Hall of Fame and became the second pure kicker (after Jan Stenerud) and the first pure punter to be inducted.

[[Punt]]

CATEGORIES: American football, Canadian football, Rugby, Sports words

In some rules of football, a punt is a play in which a player drops the ball and kicks it before it touches the ground. A punt is in contrast to a drop kick, in which the ball touches the ground before being kicked.

In American and Canadian football, the ball is kicked downfield to the opposing team, usually on the final down, with the hope of giving the receiving team a field position that is more helpful to the kicking team when possession changes.

[[Drop kick]]

CATEGORIES: American football, Canadian football, Rugby, Sports words

A drop kick is a type of kick in various rules of football. It involves a player dropping the ball and then kicking it when it bounces off the ground. It contrasts to a punt, wherein the player kicks the ball without letting it hit the ground first.

[[Single (baseball)]]

CATEGORIES: Baseball, Sports words

A single is when the batter safely reaches first base by hitting a fair ball and getting to first base before a fielder puts him out. As an exception, a batter-runner reaching first base safely is not credited with a single when an infielder attempts to put out another runner on the first play; this is one type of a fielder's choice.  Also, a batter-runner reaching first base on a play due to a fielder's error trying to put him out at first base or another runner out (as a fielder's choice) is not credited with a single.

[[Fair ball]]

CATEGORIES: Baseball rules, Sports words

In baseball, a fair ball is a batted ball that gives the batter to attempt to reach first base. In order for a batted ball to be fair, it must be hit in such a way that it:

[[Error (baseball)]]

CATEGORIES: Baseball statistics

In baseball statistics, an error, abbreviated E and then the defensive positional designation, is the act, in the judgment of the official scorer, of a fielder misplaying a ball in a manner that allows a batter or baserunner to reach one or more additional bases, when such an advance would have been prevented given ordinary effort by the fielder.

An error does not count as a hit but still counts as an at bat for the batter unless, in the scorer's judgment, the batter would have reached first base safely but one or more of the additional base(s) reached was the result of the fielder's mistake. In that case, the play will be scored both as a hit (for the number of bases the fielders should have limited the batter to) and an error. However, if a batter is judged to have reached base solely because of a fielder's mistake, it is scored as a "hit on error," and treated the same as if a batter was put out, which would lower his batting average.

Similarly, a batter does not receive credit for an RBI when runs score on an error, unless the scorer rules that a run would have scored even if the fielder had not made a mistake. For example, if a batter hits a ball to the outfield for what should be a sacrifice fly and the outfielder drops the ball for an error, the batter will still receive credit for the sacrifice fly and the run batted in.

If a play should have resulted in a fielder's choice with a runner being put out and the batter reaching base safely but the runner is safe due to an error, the play will be scored as a fielder's choice, with no hit being awarded to the batter and an error charged against the fielder.

Passed balls and wild pitches are separate statistical categories and are not scored as errors.

[[Official scorer]]

CATEGORIES: Baseball, Sports occupations

In the game of baseball, the official scorer is a person appointed by the league to record the events on the field, and to send the official scoring record of the game back to the league offices. In addition to recording the events on the field such as the outcome of each plate appearance and the circumstances of any baserunner's advance around the bases, the official scorer is also charged with making judgment calls that do not affect the progress or outcome of the game. Judgment calls are primarily made about errors, unearned runs, fielder's choice, the value of hits in certain situations, and wild pitches, all of which are included in the record compiled. This record is used to compile statistics for each player and team. A box score is a summary of the official scorer's game record.

They take part in the Gallipoli Campaign.  Over time the young men lose their innocence about the purpose of war.  The climax of the movie occurs on the Anzac battlefield at Gallipoli.  It shows the futile attack at the Battle of the Nek on 7 August 1915.

It has a number of significant historical inaccuracies.

The many running scenes in the movie are set to Jean Michel Jarre's Oxygène.

In the comics, countries are drawn as balls. The balls interact in broken English, (except for those countries who have English as their main language) and ridicule national stereotypes and international relations.

Polandball has its roots in an August 2009 'cyberwar' between Polish Internet users and the rest of the world on drawball.com. Drawball.com allows Internet users to draw whatever they want. It also allows people to draw over others drawings. On the Polish flag internet, an idea was raised to draw the flag of Poland on the ball. Thousands of Poles managed to take over the drawball. The painting consisted of white on top of red. In the middle, the word "POLSKA" was written. After co-ordination from 4chan, this was then covered over by a giant Nazi swastika.

Krautchan.net is a German-language imageboard. Its /int/ board is frequented by Russian-speaking netizens. The beginning of the Polandball meme is credited to Falco. Falco is a British user on /int/. In September 2009 Falco created the meme using MS Paint. The meme was made in an apolitical way to troll Wojak. Wojak is a Pole on the same board and contributes in broken English. Afterwards, Polandball cartoons were enthusiastically drawn by Russians.

[[Curtsey]]

CATEGORIES: Dance, Non-verbal communication

A curtsey (also spelled curtsy or courtesy) is a traditional gesture of greeting, in which a girl or woman lowers her body by bending her knees. It is the female equivalent of male bowing in European cultures.  The word "curtsy" comes from "courtesy" which means "politeness".

According to Desmond Morris, the movements in the curtsey and the bow were similar until the 17th century. Only later did the difference between the female and the male gesture develop. The earlier, combined version is still performed by Restoration comedy actors.

When a curtsey is very formal, the girl/woman bends the knees outward (rather than straight ahead), often sweeping one foot behind her. She may also use her hands to hold her skirt out from her body. In Victorian times, when women wore floor-length, hooped skirts, they curtsied using the plié movement borrowed from second-position in classical ballet in which the knees are bent while the back is held straight. Both feet and knees point out so the body lowers straight down. In this way, the lady lowers herself evenly, not to one side.   

Traditionally, women and girls curtsey to people who are of higher rank (more important) than they are, just as men and boys bow. Today this practice has become less common. In European cultures it is traditional for women to curtsey in front of members of the Royal family.  This is sometimes called a "court curtsey" and is often very deep. Some female domestic workers curtsey for their employers. 

Female dancers often curtsey at the end of a performance to show thanks or acknowledge applause from the audience. At the end of a ballet class, students will also curtsey or bow to the teacher and the pianist to thank them. According to Victorian dance etiquette, a woman curtseys before beginning a dance. Female Scottish highland dancers performing the national dances and the Irish jig also curtsey as well (at both the beginning and end for the national dances and at the end for the Irish Jig). Some female ballroom dancers will curtsey to their partners before beginning the Viennese Waltz. In some cultures females bow instead of curtseying.

[[Azerbaijani people]]

CATEGORIES: Azerbaijani people

The Azerbaijanis or Azeris are Turkic people living mainly in the Republic of Azerbaijan and in northwestern Iran, as well as in Georgia, Russia (Dagestan), Turkey and formerly Armenia. 

After the Russo-Persian War (1804–1813) and Russo-Persian War (1826–1828), the land of the Iranian Qajar dynasty in the Caucasus were given to the Russian Empire which makes up the present territory of the Republic of Azerbaijan. Lands which Iran kept are now known as Iranian Azerbaijan. Even though they live on two sides of an international border, the Azerbaijanis are a single ethnic group. However, northerners and southerners differ due to nearly two centuries of separate social evolution of Iranian Azerbaijanis and Russian/Soviet-influenced Azerbaijan. The Azerbaijani language unifies Azerbaijanis, and is mutually intelligible with Turkmen, Qashqai, Gagauz, Turkish, and the dialects spoken by the Iraqi Turkmen, all of which belong to the Oghuz, or Western, group of Turkic languages.105 The Azerbaijanis are mostly Shi'a Muslim.

[[Constitutional republic]]

CATEGORIES: Forms of government

A constitutional republic is a state where the chief executive and representatives are elected, and the rules are set down in a written constitution. 

The head of state and other representatives are elected but they do not have uncontrolled power. What their power is limited to is written in the constitution. If there is dispute about what the constitution means, this is decided by a court system that is independent from the representatives.

Constitutional republics usually have a separation of powers. The separation of powers means that no single officeholder gets unlimited power.  John Adams said that a constitutional republic was "a government of laws, and not of men".

Supporters of such a republicwho argue that it is meant to be a safeguard against "tyranny". No office holder can get to a position of absolute power. However, some have argued that a constitution can be written in such a way that it lets tyranny arise, and that a constitution is therefore not a fail proof safeguard against tyranny.

Aristotle was the first to write about the idea in his works on politics.

Constitutional monarchies are a special case: even though the monarch is not elected, the people still elect other governing bodies. The constitution also limits the power of the monarch.

[[Amur leopard]]

CATEGORIES: Panthera, Critically endangered species

The Amur leopard (Panthera pardus orientalis) is a leopard subspecies. It is sometimes called the far eastern leopard.

The leopard lives in the Primorye region of southeastern Russia and in the Jilin Province of northeast China. It is critically endangered (IUCN). Only 14–20 adults and 5–6 cubs were counted in 2007. Only 19–26 Amur leopards live in the wild.

The Amur leopards are endangered because they have been hunted for their fur. Also because their food sources are running out due to them being hunted for their fur. Amur leopards can be recognized from the patterns in their fur. They weigh about 70. They live in temperate, broadleaf and mixed forests. The Amur Leopard almost extinct by human hunting. It's called human hunting since the humans tear down the forest so no tree and bushes so the leopard cannot hide. At that time, they hunt them and sell to get money.

The number of Amur cats is decreasing due to the human activity, invasion of domestic cats, and infectious disease. Because these cats play a huge role and the ecosystem cannot afford to lose such species, researchers found a way to regenerate the endangered animal. This can be done from culture cell with somatic cloning technique (http://apps.webofknowledge.com.proxy.cc.uic.edu/full_record.do?product=WOS&search_mode=GeneralSearch&qid=2&SID=8CyO9ZnX3OlNtU6r5Ue&page=1&doc=3).

[[Ghazal]]

CATEGORIES: Poetry forms

The ghazal is a poetic form that has rhyming couplets and a refrain, with each line sharing the same meter. A ghazal talks about both the pain of loss and the beauty of love in spite of that pain. The form is ancient.  It started in 6th century Arabic verse. It comes from the Arabian panegyric qasida. The structure of the ghazal are similar in strictness to those of the Petrarchan sonnet. In its style and content it is a genre with a lot of variety of expression around its central themes of love and separation. It is one of the main poetic forms the Indo-Perso-Arabic civilization gave to the eastern Islamic world. 

The ghazal spread into South Asia in the 12th century.  This was because of the influence of Sufi mystics and the courts of the new Islamic Sultanate. Although the ghazal is mostly a form of Dari poetry and Urdu poetry, today it is found in the poetry of many languages of the Indian sub-continent. 

Ghazals were written by the Persian mystics and poets Rumi (13th century) and Hafiz (14th century), the Azeri poet Fuzuli (16th century), as well as Mirza Ghalib (1797–1869) and Muhammad Iqbal (1877–1938).  Through Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749–1832), the ghazal became very popular in Germany during the 19th century.  The form was used by Friedrich Rückert (1788–1866) and August von Platen (1796–1835). The Kashmiri-American poet Agha Shahid Ali liked the form. He edited a volume of "real ghazals in English". 

It is common in ghazals for the poet's name to be in the last verse.  This is known as takhallus.

[[Macedonian phalanx]]

CATEGORIES: Military terminology, Ancient Greece

The Macedonian phalanx is an infantry formation developed by Philip II. It was used by his son Alexander the Great to conquer the Persian Empire. The formation was made up of spearmen carrying 18 to 20 ft (5.56 m) long spears. These were called sarissas. They were two-handed; the smaller shields were slung over the left shoulder. 

The Macedonian phalanx was impregnable from the front, but vulnerable from the sides and back, where it could be attacked by the enemy cavalry. Therefore, the system required protection, which it got from the Macedonian cavalry, which was the most flexible force.

At the start of a battle, Alexander used the phalanx to pin down the enemy. His heavy cavalry would drive the enemy horse from the field, and then charge selected opponents or exposed enemy unit flanks. Then, the phalanx would move against the centre. 

The early Greek city states often fought on narrow valley floors, where cavalry was not so important. Often, there was little or no cavalry. But in the Greco-Persian Wars, the battles were fought on more open land, where cavalry was a great force. An example of this is the Battle of Gaugamela. There, Alexander manoeuvered to the right to prevent a double envelopment from the Persian army. Darius commanded his cavalry on his left flank to check the oblique movement of the Greeks by attacking their cavalry. Alexander's Companion cavalry then charged the weakened enemy center where Darius was posted and were followed by the phalanx formation.

[[Sustainable seafood]]

CATEGORIES: Fishing, Sustainable development

For thousands of years, people have caught and eaten fish and seafood. Today this has become a problem: The population has increased, and more fish and seafood need to be caught to feed all the people.

Sustainable seafood is the idea of catching the fish, without putting the ecosystem they come from in danger. Sustainable seafood is either caught wild, or it is farmed, but without endangering the ecosystem, and giving the stocks a chance to grow. There are different non-profit organizations that watch over these rules. Special labels have been created so the consumer can see that the fish or seafood was bred or caught in accordance with these rules.

[[Raven paradox]]

CATEGORIES: Logical paradoxes

The Raven paradox is a paradox first presented by the German logician Carl Gustav Hempel in the 1940s.  The paradox stems from two intuitive principles for inductive reasoning: (i) logically-equivalent claims are interchangeable and (ii) particular instances confirm the corresponding universal generalization.  Hempel showed that (i) and (ii) together entail the unintuitive conclusion that claims of the form "All As are Bs" can be confirmed by observing non-A, non-B objects.

[[Margin of error]]

Margins of error occur when a population is incompletely sampled. Usually, the margin of error is defined as the radius (half the width) of a confidence interval for a given sample.

[[Overfishing]]

CATEGORIES: Environmental issues, Ecology, Fishing

Overfishing is catching too much fish. It is a type of overexploitation where fish stocks are reduced to low levels. It is a good example of what is good for the short term is not good for the long term. Also, what is good for some fishermen is not good for all of them (tragedy of the commons). The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization estimated in a 2018 report that 33.1% of world fish stocks are subject to overfishing.

So much fish is caught that there are too few adults of  certain species left.  With cod, for example, the greatest production of eggs is from large females. But these are caught, the average size of spawning females goes down. Eventually this gets so that the production of eggs is significantly reduced. The artificial selection of large fish has gradually reduced the size of mature females.

The Northwest Atlantic cod has been regarded as heavily overfished throughout its range, resulting in a crash in the fishery in the United States and Canada during the early 1990s. Sometimes, the fishing industry can ruin itself by overfishing. The collapse of the herring industry in Monterey, California is a good example. 

Consumers can get information about the conservation status of the seafood available to them.

[[Hawaiian–Emperor seamount chain]]

CATEGORIES: Seamounts, Geography of Hawaii, Pacific Ocean

The Hawaiian–Emperor seamount chain is the Hawaiian Islands and the Emperor Seamounts: together they form a vast underwater mountain region of islands, seamounts, atolls, shallows, banks and reefs. The line goes southeast to northwest beneath the northern Pacific Ocean; and many of the underwater mountains are guyots.

The seamount chain, with over 80 identified undersea volcanoes, stretches over 5800 from the Aleutian Trench in the far northwest Pacific to the Loʻihi seamount, the youngest volcano in the chain, which lies about 35 southeast of the Island of Hawaiʻi. 

The oldest age for the Emperor Seamounts is 81 million years, and comes from Detroit Seamount. However, Meiji Guyot, located to the north of Detroit Seamount, is likely somewhat older.

In 1963, geologist John Tuzo Wilson explained that the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain was created by a hotspot of volcanic activity that stood as the Pacific tectonic plate moved over it. This left a trail of volcanic islands and seamounts. A "bend" or "V" in the chain marks a shift in the movement of the Pacific plate some 47 million years ago, from a northward to a more northwesterly direction. The bend shows how a tectonic plate can shift direction suddenly. A look at the USGS map on the origin of the Hawaiian Islands clearly shows this "spearpoint".

Recent research shows that the hotspot itself may have moved with time. Some evidence comes from analysis of the orientation of the ancient magnetic field preserved by magnetite in ancient lava flows sampled at four seamounts.

[[Shilling]]

CATEGORIES: Currency

The shilling is a unit of currency used in some current and former British Commonwealth countries. The word shilling comes from scilling, an accounting term that dates back to Anglo-Saxon times where it was said to be the value of a cow in Kent or a sheep elsewhere. The word is thought to derive from the base skell-, "to ring/resound" and the diminutive suffix -ling. The slang term for a shilling as a currency unit was a "bob".

The abbreviation for shilling is s, from the Latin solidus, the name of a Roman coin. Often it was informally represented by a slash, standing for a long s: e.g., "1/6" would be 1 shilling and sixpence, often pronounced "one and six" (and equivalent to 18d; the shilling itself was valued at 12d). A price with no pence would be written with a slash and a dash, e.g., "11/-". Quite often a triangle or (serif) apostrophe would be used to give a neater appearance, e.g., "1'6"  and "11'-". In Africa it is often abbreviated sh.

During the Great Recoinage of 1816, the mint was instructed to coin one troy pound (weighing 5760 grains) of standard (0.925 fine) silver into 66 shillings, or its equivalent in other denominations. This effectively set the weight of the shilling, and its subsequent decimal replacement 5 new pence coin, at 87.2727 grains or 5.655 grams from 1816 to 1990, when a new smaller 5p coin was introduced.

[[Kundalini]]

CATEGORIES: Hinduism

In the Hindu religion, there is a strong spirit energy called Kundalini.  It lives in all people but nearly always sleeps, curled like a snake near the bottom of their spine, in the first chakra.  If it ever wakes up, it climbs the spine and the other chakras, and the whole body and mind of the person fill with energy and understanding.  This feels so special that people cannot find words to say what it is like.  Some people try to wake kundalini up by meditation or yoga.  A person with awake kundalini can help, by sending energy to them.  This is called shaktipat.

Kundalini is a Hindu name, but ideas that are nearly the same come from all around the world.  Some of these are the Taoist 'greater kan and li', Egyptian 'sekhem', Hebrew 'shekinah', Christian 'Pentecostal fire', Kaballist 'secret fire' and Kalahari 'num'.

[[Oviraptorosaur]]

CATEGORIES: Oviraptorosauria, Cretaceous dinosaurs

Oviraptorosaurs are a group of feathered maniraptoran dinosaurs from the Cretaceous period of what are now Asia and North America. They have short, beaked, parrot-like skulls, with or without bony head crests. They ranged in size from Caudipteryx, which was the size of a turkey, to the 8 meter long, 1.4 ton Gigantoraptor.  The most complete oviraptorosaur specimens have been found in Asia. The North American oviraptorosaur record is sparse. 

The group (and all maniraptoran dinosaurs) is close to the ancestry of birds. Oviraptorosaurs might be primitive flightless birds. On the other hand, they might just be close relatives of the birds.

The earliest and most basal ("primitive") known oviraptorosaurs are Protarchaeopteryx robusta and Incisivosaurus gauthieri, both from the lower Yixian Formation of China, dating to about 125 million years ago in the Lower Cretaceous. Some fragmentary species, such as Calamospondylus oweni and Thecocoelurus daviesi, may have been even earlier members of the Oviraptorosauria. A tiny neck vertebra from England shares some features in common with oviraptorosaurs. It may represent an earlier occurrence of this group, at about 140 million years ago.

[[List of National Football League stadiums]]

CATEGORIES: National Football League venues, United States-related lists, Sports lists

The following is a list of current National Football League stadiums, sorted by how many people it holds, their locations, their first year of usage and home teams.

As of the upcoming 2020 season, two sets of teams share a stadium—the New York Giants and New York Jets with MetLife Stadium, and the Los Angeles Chargers and Los Angeles Rams with SoFi Stadium—meaning there are only 30 full-time NFL stadiums.

The NFL uses several other stadiums on a regular basis in addition to the teams' designated regular home sites. The Jacksonville Jaguars currently have an agreement to play at least one regular-season home game per year at Wembley Stadium in London, England, as part of the NFL International Series through 2020. Another London venue, Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, is also a regular International Series host.

Fawcett Stadium in Canton, Ohio, is the location of the annual exhibition Pro Football Hall of Fame Game. 

The New York Giants and New York Jets' MetLife Stadium is the largest stadium in the NFL by its regular seating capacity. The Dallas Cowboys' AT&T Stadium can expand past that of MetLife Stadium by means of using standing-room and temporary seating, which makes AT&T Stadium currently the only NFL stadium capable of holding 100,000 or more spectators, though it normally only seats 80,000. With the opening of SoFi Stadium, the smallest NFL stadium is Soldier Field, home to the Chicago Bears.

David James Arquette is an American actor, movie director, and producer. He was born in Winchester, Virginia to actor Lewis Arquette (1935-2001) and poet Mardi (née Nowak, died 1997). He is best known for his role as Deputy Sheriff Dewey Riley in the Scream movies. 

Arquette played a wrestling fan in the movie Ready to Rumble. To market this movie, WCW hired Arquette to appear on their TV show and win their world title. Arquette argued he should not win the belt because he is not a real wrestler but WCW talked him into it. The attention received was only negative and the backlash eventually caused WCW to go out of business. The movie was also a critical disaster that ruined the careers of some of the actors in it, like Oliver Platt.

Because Arquette is also a wrestling fan in real life, he regretted making a mockery of wrestling and donated the money he made from WCW to families of dead wrestlers Owen Hart and Brian Pillman and also to Darren Drozdov, who was paralyzed in a wrestling match.

Arquette was a contestant on the 13th season of Dancing with the Stars in fall 2011.

The Teatro Regio ('Royal Theatre') is a well-known opera house and opera company in Turin, Italy.

Operas had been performed in various buildings in Turin during the 17th century but it was not until 1713 that a proper opera house was planned.  It was not built and finished until 1740.  It was a beautiful opera house with 1,500 seats and with 139 boxes.

In 1792 it was closed and became a warehouse.  With the French occupation of Turin during the Napoleonic War the theatre was renamed the Teatro Nazionale and finally, after Napoleon became emperor, renamed again as the Teatro Imperiale.   When Napoleon's lost power in 1814 it got its original name back: the Regio.

Other theatres were built and gave seasons of opera in Turin. Among them was the restored Teatro Carignano in 1824. It was taken over by the municipality in 1932 and, after the destruction by fire of the Teatro Regio in 1936, the Carignano was the main opera house in the city until the Regio reopened in 1973.

The Regio was rebuilt in 1905 but the theatre closed during the First World War and re-opened in 1919.  Until February 1936, seasons of opera were presented until fire then destroyed everything except the front of the building. It remained closed for thirty-seven years.  Arturo Toscanini was the conductor of the Turin Opera from 1895 to 1898, during which time several production of works of Wagner were given their first Italian performances.

The opera house was rebuilt an opened in 10 April 1973 with a production of Verdi's I Vespri Siciliani directed by Maria Callas and Giuseppe Di Stefano.

The new house, which uses the original frontage, seats 1,750 and is elliptical in shape with a large orchestra level and 37 boxes. An acoustic shell was added to improve its sound.  Many operas are performed there, including modern operas.

He was educated at the Hindu College, Calcutta. In 1843, he became a Christian. He was born in Sagordari, a village in Keshobpur Upozila, Jessore District, East Bengal (now in Bangladesh). He was a pioneer of Bengali drama. His famous work Meghnad Bodh Kavya, is a tragic Novel. It has nine cantos and is exceptional in Bengali literature both in terms of style and content. He also wrote poems about the sorrows and pains of love as spoken by women.  

From an early age, Dutt wanted to be an Englishman in form and manner. In later life, he regretted his attraction to England and the Occident.  He wrote lovingly of his homeland in his poems and sonnets from this period.

His early writings were in English, but they were unsuccessful. He turned, reluctantly at first, to Bengali. His main works, written mostly between 1858 and 1862, include prose drama, long narrative poems, and lyrics. His first play, Sarmistha (1858), was well received. His poetical works are Tilottamasambhab (1860), a narrative poem on the story of Sunda and Upasunda; Meghnadbadh (1861), his most important piece, an epic on the Rāmāyaṇa theme; Brajangana (1861), a cycle of lyrics on the Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa theme; and Birangana (1862), a set of 21 epistolary poems on the model of Ovid’s Heroides.

[[Kabaddi]]

CATEGORIES: Team sports, Sport in Bangladesh, Sport in Iran, Sport in Pakistan, Sport in India

Kabaddi                     is a team sport.

Two teams are on opposite halves of a small field.  They take turns sending a "raider" into the other half. This is to win points by tackling members of the opposing team. Then the raider tries to return to his own half.  He holds his breath and chants the word "Kabaddi" during the whole raid. The raider must not cross the lobby unless he touches any of his opponents. If he does not touch anyone then he will be "out". There is also a bonus line.  If the raider touches it and returns to his side of the field, he will get extra points. If the raider is not able to get back to his own side, then he is considered "out".

In the international team version of kabaddi there are two teams of seven members and 4 are in substitution

.  Each are on opposite halves of a field of 10 m × 13 m in case of men and 8 m × 12 m in case of women. Each has five extra players held in reserve. The game is played with 20-minute halves.  There is a five-minute half-time break when the teams change sides.

Teams take turns sending a "raider" to the opposite team's half.  The goal is to tag or wrestle ("confine") members of the opposite team. Tagged members are "out" and temporarily sent off the field.

The goal of the defenders is to stop the raider from returning to the home side before taking a breath. If any of the seven players cross the lobby without touching the raider he will be declared as "out".

The raider is sent off the field if:

Each time when a player is "out", the opposing team earns a point. A team scores a bonus of two points, called a "lona", if the entire opposing team is declared "out". At the end of the game, the team with the most points wins.

Matches are based on age and weight. Six officials supervise a match: one referee, two umpires, a scorer and two assistant scorers.

Kabaddi received International exposure in 1937 Olympics ,Demonstrated by India.The game was introduced in Indian Games in Calcutta 1938.Kabaddi is popularized by Sundar Ram of India in Japan,When he toured on behalf Asian Amatruer Kabaddi Federation.

[[James–Lange theory]]

CATEGORIES: Emotions

The James-Lange Theory is a hypothesis about emotions. It is one of the earliest theories of emotion. The theory is that emotions come from the physiological response to what is happening around us.

It was developed independently by two 19th-century scholars, William James and Carl Lange. The basic idea of the theory is that physiological arousal triggers the experience of a specific emotion. The theory is that the physiological change is primary, and emotion is caused by the information from the body's nervous system.

The theory has been criticised and modified over the course of time. There are several competing theories.

[[Gestational diabetes]]

CATEGORIES: Diseases and disorders of the female reproductive system, Diabetes mellitus

Gestational diabetes (or gestational diabetes mellitus, GDM) is a condition in which females who previously were not having diabetes exhibit higher than normal levels of blood sugar while pregnant. The illness usually shows few signs/symptoms. It is usually found during pregnancy medical checks. Up to 16% of pregnant women are affected by GDM.  Pregnant women with family history of having diabetes and ethnic background have higher chances of getting the disease.  

Gestational diabetes is caused when a pregnant woman's body does not produce enough insulin, leading to higher than normal blood sugar levels. Some women with GDM are treated with drugs. However, healthy eating and regular exercise can help to lower the chances of getting GDM. 

It is still unclear what causes gestational diabetes. It may be due to the action of pregnancy hormones, blocking the action of insulin to its receptors. This prevents cells to take in glucose properly. This causes sugar to remain in blood, where it continues to rise.  

Babies born to mothers with  gestational diabetes can have many problems, such as, being too large (which may make childbirth difficult), lower than normal blood glucose, or being born too early.  More serious problems include brain problems or dead before birth. In addition, women with gestational diabetes have higher risk of getting Type 2 diabetes (or, in fewer cases, Type 1 diabetes) after pregnancy.  

In most cases, children belonging to mothers having gestational diabetes are at higher risk of childhood obesity and Type 2 diabetes later in life. This can be stopped through healthy eating and regular  exercise.

[[Hyperglycemia]]

CATEGORIES: Blood disorders

Hyperglycemia means high blood sugar levels at or beyond 200 mg/dl. It is a serious and life threatening health problem that can be fatal if not properly treated in time. 

In a healthy body, insulin helps glucose (sugar) get from the blood into the body's cells.  There, the cells can use the sugar to make energy.  However, when there is not enough insulin in the body, or if a person's body does not react to insulin normally (this is called insulin resistance), too much sugar stays in the blood.  This can cause serious health problems.

Extremely high blood sugar means diabetes mellitus, a condition that often causes very high blood sugar. Hyperglycemia that comes and goes may mean diabetes of any kind, or may be developing under low insulin levels or resistance to insulin.
