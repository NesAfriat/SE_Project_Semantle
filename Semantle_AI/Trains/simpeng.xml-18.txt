[[Trans-Karakoram Tract]]

CATEGORIES: Valleys, Kashmir, Geography of China, Territorial disputes of India

The Trans-Karakoram Tract is an area of nearly 5,180 to 5,300 km² that was transferred by a border agreement from the Pakistani-administered Northern Areas to China in 1963 with the proviso that the settlement was subject to the final solution of the Kashmir dispute. Pakistan says that it was a no-man's undemarcated border land, hence no question arises of its being transferred. It is claimed by India as part of the state of Jammu and Kashmir.

The tract, called Shaksgam, is technically part of Shigar, a valley of Baltistan region of Ladakh Province. The Raja of Shigar controlled this land until 1971, when Pakistan abolished the Raja government system. A polo ground in Shaksgam was built by the Amacha Royal family of Shigar, and the Rajas of Shigar used to invite the Amirs of Yarkand to play polo there. All the names of the mountains, lakes, rivers and passes are in Balti/Ladakhi, suggesting that this land has been part of Baltistan/Ladakh province for a long time.

The Tract is one of the most inhospitable areas of the world, with some of the highest mountains including Broad Peak, Gasherbrum and Masherbrum, and is adjacent to the highest battlefield in the world at Siachen Glacier.

[[Parody mass]]

CATEGORIES: Masses (music)

A parody mass is a musical setting of the mass that uses melodies from other musical works. This kind of mass was popular in the 16th century. "Parody" in this sense does not mean "parody" in the modern meaning of the word. It is not about poking fun at something. A parody mass is one that borrows musical material. The music might be borrowed from a chanson or motet, usually one by another composer. At that time there was nothing shameful about using other composer's tunes. Today it would be called plagiarism (stealing other people's ideas).

The parody mass was very popular during the Renaissance: Palestrina wrote about 50 parody masses. Some examples of early parody masses include the Missa Malheur me bat, Missa Mater Patris, and Missa Fortuna desperata by Josquin Desprez. By the middle of the 16th century, a large number of masses composed used the parody technique.

He was the second son of a daimyo of the Akizuki clan. His father controlled part of Hyuga province. His mother was a granddaughter of the fourth head of Yonezawa. As a child, he was called "Matsusaburō" (松三郎) and "Naomatsu" (直松). He was adopted by the daimyo of Yonezawa, Uesugi Shigesada. In 1767 he replaced Shigesada as diamyo. After retirement, he began to use the gō, or pen name, Yozan (鷹山).

Today, Uesugi is best remembered for his financial changes in his domain. He is often used as an example of a good governor of a domain. Yonezawa had been in debt for about a hundred years when Uesugi took over. Shigesada had thought about returning the domain to the shogunate because of the debt. His his father-in-law, the daimyo of Owari province, told him he should resign as daimyo instead of this. This is how Uesugi came to be daimyo of Yonezawa. He created strict disciplinary measures. Several of his karō (advisers) did not think his plans were good. He had these people killed. Because of many of the changes he caused, Yonezawa became prosperous. It also did not suffer much from the famine in Japan in the Tenmei era (1781-9). In 1830, less than a decade after Harunori's death, the shogunate said that Yonezawa was a paragon of a well-governed domain.

Uesugi's beliefs about governance and how a feudal lord show act were written in a letter to his son Haruhiro:

The Dice snake (Natrix tessellata) is a European non-venomous snake belonging to the family of Colubridae, subfamily Natricinae.

The Dice snake lives a lot in eastern Europe and western Asia, though not as much as the grass snake. Only one species, N.t.heinrothi, is recognized, from the island of Serpilor (Osrov Zminyi) in the Black Sea. Dice snakes are better in water and they have a more slender body. They are mostly able to see easily in a woodland or desert, and sometimes in mountain streams. They usually eat fish, and sometimes they may also eat amphibians. The dice snake is a bit shy. They may grow up to 90 cm long, and has a brown or grey colouring. Although Dice snakes can be seen in Asia, they do not live a lot on Crete. Dice snakes do not have any venom. They can let out a very bad smell, however, for defense. Another thing they use for defending themselves is playing dead. Dice snakes go into dry holes next to the water, and sleep from October to April. This is called hibernating.

[[Baphomet]]

CATEGORIES: Demons

Baphomet is a name of unestablished origin. It first appeared in trial transcripts during the inquisition of the Knights Templar in the early 1300s. Some modern scholars believe the name to have been an Old French corruption and misspelling of the name Mahomet (Muhammad). Nowadays it is generally viewed as a symbol of the Devil.

In the Middle Ages, the Templar were accused of heresy, such as denying Jesus Christ and spitting on the cross. They also supposedly worshiped an icon called "Bafomet". Beyond this, little is known about the origins of the Baphomet.

In the 1800s, magician Eliphas Levi interpreted Baphomet as an occult symbol representing perfection, or the union of opposites to create divine harmony. To illustrate his point, he depicted the entity as a goat-headed androgyne with wings, female breasts, a rod between its legs, and a flaming torch between its horns.

This imagery was soon used by people who thought it was Satanic- notably in anti-Freemasonry tracts, where some writers accused Masons of worshipping  the devil. Many evangelical Christians still believe masonry to be of the devil.

In modern times, Baphomet has been adapted as a symbol by occultists and Satanists. A related symbol (also drawn by Levi) is the Sigil of Baphomet, which is a goat's head drawn inside a five-pointed star. It has become a common icon among heavy metal bands like Slayer and Venom. The Sigil of Baphomet is also the official logo of the Church of Satan.

[[Soyons]]

CATEGORIES: Communes in Ardèche

Soyons is a commune in the Ardèche département in southern France. Humans have lived on this 30 hectare site for 150,000 years. This means it is the oldest inhabited (lived in) site in France, with remains from all the time periods. Because of Soyons location along the Rhône, at the crossroads of routes, it played a major role in the history of France.

== History ==  

The Paleolithic caves of Greenhouse Guercy http://www.soyons.fr/index.php/Le-musee/les-grottes-de-soyons.html https://web.archive.org/web/20090815091807/http://www.soyons.fr/index.php/Le-musee/les-grottes-de-soyons.html provided safe and comfortable living for Neanderthal man. The caves were lived in by man, alternating with large meat eating animals (carnivores) (lions, hyenas and cave bears). Two outdoor areas for the butchering of mammoths, used by the Cro-Magnon Neanderthal people, have been discovered.

Several Neolithic populations lived on the site. In particular, Chalcolithic people buried their dead in burial caves like Grotte des Enfants and Hole Roland, as well as under mounds, such as that of Greenhouse Aurouze.

A Gallic oppidum, a pre-Roman town protected with a fort, was a feature on the massive Malpas and along the Rhone, the site of the Brégoule http://www.soyons.fr/index.php/Notre-histoire/le-site-de-la-bregoule.html https://web.archive.org/web/20091017065035/http://www.soyons.fr/index.php/Notre-histoire/le-site-de-la-bregoule.html. This was the home of the tribe Segovellaunes who worshipped the goddess Soïo, and who gave the village its name.

During the Roman period, the Romans built a town on the site of the existing village.

In the Middle Ages, Soyons became a principality, with a royal abbey and a Carolingian church. The village and the plateau are surrounded by ramparts, with corner towers; the Leaning Tower is the remains of the tower of a fort. During the wars of religion the city was besieged and destroyed several times.

[[Knights Templar]]

CATEGORIES: Christianity of the Middle Ages, Knights

The Poor Fellow-Soldiers of Christ and of the Temple of Solomon (Latin: Pauperes commilitones Christi Templique Salomonici), commonly known as the Knights Templar or the Order of the Temple (French: Ordre du Temple or Templiers), were among the most famous military orders of Western Christianity. The organization lasted for two centuries in the Middle Ages. It was founded after the First Crusade of 1096, with its original purpose to ensure the safety of the many Christians who made the pilgrimage to Jerusalem after it was taken from the Muslims.

It was officially endorsed by the Roman Catholic Church around 1129, and became a favored charity by many Christians and grew fast in membership and power. Templar knights wore white mantles quartered by a red cross and were among the most skilled fighting units of the Crusades. Those members of the Order that did not fight managed a large economic infrastructure throughout Christendom, innovating financial techniques that were an early form of banking, and building many fortifications throughout the Mediterranean and the Holy Land.

The Templars' success was tied closely to the Crusades; when the Holy Land was lost, support for the Order faded. Rumors about the Templars' secret initiation ceremony created mistrust, and King Philip IV of France, deeply in debt to the Order, began pressuring Pope Clement V to take action against the Order. In 1307, many of the Order's members in France were arrested, tortured into giving false confessions, and then burned at the stake. In 1312, Pope Clement, under continuing pressure from King Philip, disbanded the Order.

[[Propædia]]

CATEGORIES: Encyclopædia Britannica

The Propædia is the first of three parts of the Encyclopædia Britannica, the other two being the 12-volume Micropædia and the 17-volume Macropædia. The Propædia is supposed to be a book that organizes the things in the Britannica, and a guideline to the index of the  other two parts. It was introduced in 1974 with the 15th edition of the encyclopaedia to replace the index, but when many people complained, Britannica put the index back in two books in 1985. The core of the Propædia is its Outline of Knowledge, which is supposed to give people a classification of what we know, but the Propædia also has some parts listing the staff members, advisors and contributors to all three parts of the Britannica.

The Propædia can be used by a student who wants to know what there is to know, before even finding out about it.  Once the student finds out what he needs to know, he will then find out about the thing itself.

The Outline has ten Parts, each with an essay to introduce the part. Below is the table of the ten parts.

[[Macropædia]]

CATEGORIES: Encyclopædia Britannica

The 17-book Macropædia is the third part of the Encyclopædia Britannica, and the other two parts are the 12-book Micropædia and the 1-book Propædia. The name comes from the word "macro" and "encyclopaedia". Macro means big, and so, the Macropædia is a big encyclopaedia. The Macropaedia has articles that are very detailed, but one article is usually about a very large topic. It is the opposite of the Micropædia, which has articles that are short. 

The Macropædia was introduced in the 15th edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica in 1974 with 19 book having 4,207 articles. In 1985, these articles were combined and made smaller into 17 books with about 700 articles, which can be as short as 2 pages, and as long as 310 pages. The longest article, on the United States, was from the combining of the 50 articles on each state. 

Since it was created, it has not stayed the same. New articles are always being added, older articles can be split, shortened, merged, or even deleted. 

[[Micropædia]]

CATEGORIES: Encyclopædia Britannica

The 12-book Micropædia is one of the three parts of the 15th edition of Encyclopædia Britannica, and the other two being the one-book Propædia and the 17-book Macropædia. The name comes from the word "micro" and "encyclopaedia". Micro means small and so, the Micropaedia is a small encyclopedia. The Micropaedia has articles that are very short, the articles are found in small strips. It is the opposite of the Macropaedia, which has articles that are very long.

The Micropædia was introduced in 1974 with 10 books having 102,214 short articles, all of them are less than 750 words. In the 15th edition, many articles were put together, with about only 65,000 articles in 12 volumes. In general, the 750-word limit is still used and most articles are only 1-2 paragraphs; however, a few longer articles can be found in the 2007 Micropædia, such as the Internet ones, which takes up a full page.

With some exceptions, the 65,000 articles of the Micropædia have no bibliographies and no named contributors. It is supposed to be for fast-checking to find out the main things about the topic, and as a guide to the 700 longer articles of the Macropædia. People use it to know just a little, but the Macropaedia is used to know in detail.

Wunderlich came from a musical family.  His mother was a violinist and his father was a choir-master. The family did not find it easy to make a living, especially after Fritz's father committed suicide when Fritz was five years old.  As a young man Wunderlich worked in a bakery.  People heard him singing while he worked, and he was persuaded to study music.  He got a scholarship to study at the Freiburg College of Music where he studied French horn and singing.

Wunderlich soon became known as a brilliant young tenor.  He sang several roles in Mozart's operas, and gradually learned roles in many other operas, including Verdi's Rigoletto and Don Carlo.  There is an excellent recording of Mozart's Magic Flute in which Wunderlich sings the part of the Prince Tamino and the famous baritone Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau sings the part of Papageno, the birdcatcher.

Wunderlich had a lovely, clear voice which was excellent for German Lieder.  He sang the great songs of Schubert and Schumann, especially Schumann's Dichterliebe song cycle.

Wunderlich was becoming world famous when he died from an accident: he fell down the stairs of a friend's hunting house and died just before his 36th birthday.

[[Liberal arts]]

CATEGORIES: Liberal arts, Cultural history

Liberal arts is the term given to contemporary programmes of education which include areas of study across the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and the arts. It has its origins in Ancient Greece and began with a "desire for a universal understanding". Simply put liberal arts education aimed at holistic education. This can be simplified even further to an education born out of the development of number and language. It developed throughout classical antiquity but began with Pythagoras and his interest in all things mathematical. Pythagoras learnt a lot from the Ancient Egyptians and eventually after hundreds of years and various contributions this knowledge became the four specialisms (Quadrivium) of astronomy, arithmetic, geometry and music. Language became more and more important in human affairs and by 4th century Athens it was paramount to how the city state (polis) was governed. Therefore education also began to include instruction in how to speak well. Again over hundreds of years and with numerous contributions this became formalised as the three language arts (Trivium) of grammar, dialectic, and rhetoric. 

Liberal arts became formalised in the middle ages drawing on its origins in Ancient Greek and Roman culture. Perhaps the most famous image of the Liberal Arts is plate 11, Philosophy and the Liberal Arts from the Garden of Delights (The Hortus deliciarum) which was created by a group of women in the 12th century. In the image right you can see the seven liberal arts arranged around the Queen Philosophy who sits above Socrates and Plato. "Their encyclopedia compiled ideas drawn from philosophy, theology, literature, music, arts, and sciences and was intended as a teaching tool for women of the abbey who focused on Liberal Arts Education."

Being holistic, liberal arts education aimed at bringing the theoretical and practical together. As Dante put it, so "that the theoretical intellect by extension becomes practical, its goal then being doing and making". It was intended to be a mental and practical education which by the time of the Renaissance realised a many sided individual. 

Historically it was an education reserved only for the elite, and students were predominantly young gentlemen from wealthy families deemed respectable and important. Today, in the USA liberal arts education is still restricted to "elites" who can afford to pay significant fees to attend exclusive liberal arts colleges. Across Europe liberal arts education is now far more affordable with some Universities explicitly stating that it can now "be enjoyed by everyone."

[[Brain damage]]

CATEGORIES: Health problems, Brain

Brain damage is damage to the brain from either illnesses or injuries. Brain cells are damaged, which often affects one's brain in a way that stops the brain from thinking or reacting the same way as it did before the brain was damaged.

Physical damage to the brain is called traumatic brain injury (TBI). It has occurred since ancient times, and old medical records exist.

[[Assembly language]]

CATEGORIES: Programming languages

An assembly language is a programming language that can be used to directly tell the computer what to do. An assembly language is almost exactly like the machine code that a computer can understand, except that it uses words in place of numbers. A computer cannot really understand an assembly program directly. However, it can easily change the program into machine code by replacing the words of the program with the numbers that they stand for. A program that does that is called an assembler.

Programs written in assembly language are usually made of instructions, which are small tasks that the computer performs when it is running the program.  They are called instructions because the programmer uses them to instruct the computer what to do.  The part of the computer that follows the instructions is the processor.

The assembly language of a computer is a low-level language, which means that it can only be used to do the simple tasks that a computer can understand directly. In order to perform more complex tasks, one must tell the computer each of the simple tasks that are part of the complex task. For example, a computer does not understand how to print a sentence on its screen. Instead, a program written in assembly must tell it how to do all of the small steps that are involved in printing the sentence.

Such an assembly program would be composed of many, many instructions, that together do something that seems very simple and basic to a human. This makes it hard for humans to read an assembly program. In contrast, a high-level programming language may have a single instruction such as PRINT "Hello, world!" that will tell the computer to perform all of the small tasks for you.

[[United States metropolitan area]]

CATEGORIES: Cities in the United States

Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSA) are large metropolitan areas of the United States as defined by the Office of Management and Budget. These areas are urban areas with a lot of people. An earlier version of the MSA was the "Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area" (SMSA). MSAs are used for official purposes.

MSAs are made up of counties and for some county equivalents. In New England, because of the greater importance of towns over counties, similar areas are based on town units. These are called New England City and Town Areas (NECTAs).

MSAs are created around a central urban area —an areawhere there are a lot of people. The counties with the urbanized area are known as the central counties of the MSA. Other nearby counties (known as outlying counties) can be a part of the MSA if these counties have strong social and economic connections to the central counties. Some areas within these outlying counties may actually be rural areas.

The population estimates for some metro areas are not always agreed upon. In some cases, different sources give numbers of people which differ by millions. The definitions used for the last U.S. Census differed from those for previous censuses. This makes it hard to compare official information from different dates. MSA boundaries do not stretch into Canada or Mexico. This can affect the number of people in several cities. For example, Detroit, Buffalo, El Paso and San Diego are often much larger than their MSA figures.

As of June 2003, there is now an additional classification, “Metropolitan Division.” The term metropolitan division is used for a county or group of counties that are a distinct employment area within a metropolitan statistical area that has at least 2.5 million people. A metropolitan division is a part of a larger metropolitan statistical area but it is often a distinct social, economic, and cultural area within the larger region.

Dorah Pass, also spelled and pronounced Durah Pass, connects Badakshan in Afghanistan with Chitral in Pakistan. The Dorah Pass is more than 14,000 feet (4,300 m) high. It crosses the Hindu Kush mountains. The pass became important during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan because the Soviets could not stop the flow of arms and men back and forth across the pass. Almost all the Munji-speaking people of Afghanistan fled across the border to Chitral during the War in Afghanistan.

Pamir is a high plateau sometimes called "The roof of the world" that joins Pakistan, Afghanistan, Tajikistan, China and Kashmir. Marco Polo is believed to have crossed the Pamir Mountains on his way to China.

The Dorah Pass is one of the four major mountain passes that enter Chitral. The others are the Broghol Pass from the Wakhan Corridor of Afghanistan, Shandur Top from Gilgit, and Lowari Top from Dir in Pakistan.

[[Kilik Pass]]

CATEGORIES: Mountain passes of Pakistan

Kilik Pass (el. 4827 m./15,837 ft.), 30 km to the west of Mintaka Pass is a high mountain pass in Pakistan. The two passes were, in ancient times, the two main access points into the Upper Hunza Valley (also called Gojal Valley) from the north.

This was the shortest and quickest way into northern Kashmir from the Tarim Basin, and one that was usually open all year, but was extremely dangerous and only suited for travellers on foot. From Tashkurgan one travelled just over 70 km south to the junction of the Minteke River. Heading some 80 km west up this valley one reached the Mintaka Pass, (and 30 km farther, the alternative Kilik Pass), which both led into upper Hunza from where one could travel over the infamous rafiqs or "hanging passages" to Gilgit and on, either to Kashmir, or to the Gandharan plains.

Laden animals could be taken over the Mintaka and Kilik passes into upper Hunza (both open all year), but then loads would have to be carried by coolie (porters) to Gilgit (an expensive and dangerous operation). From there, cargoes could be reloaded onto pack animals again and taken either east to Kashmir and then on to Taxila (a long route), or west to Chitral which provided relatively easy access to either Jalalabad, or Peshawar via Swat.

The Mintaka Pass was the main one used in ancient times until the fairly recent advance of glacier ice. After the glaciation of the Mintaka Pass, the Kilik Pass was favoured by caravans coming from China and Afghanistan as it is wider, free of glaciers and provided enough pasture for caravan animals.

The new Karakoram Highway heads farther south, and then west over the Khunjerab Pass (4,934 m or 16,188 ft; 36° 51' N; 75° 32' E).

[[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]]

CATEGORIES: 1945 in Japan, Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Nuclear weapons, World War II, August events

The Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were nuclear attacks on the Empire of Japan during World War II (WWII). The United States and the Allies were fighting against Japan and slowly winning. Two nuclear weapons were dropped on Japan, one on the city of Hiroshima and the other on the city of Nagasaki. The generals wanted to bomb Kokura instead of Nagasaki, but it was too cloudy over Kokura that day. U.S. President Harry S. Truman ordered these attacks on August 6 and 9, 1945.  This was near the end of WWII.

The atomic bombs had been created through the Manhattan Project. They created two bombs. The first bomb was called Little Boy, and was to be dropped on Hiroshima, and the second bomb was called Fat Man, and was to be dropped on Nagasaki. Nuclear bombs are much more powerful than other bombs. Six days after the explosion over Nagasaki, and after the Soviet invasion of Manchukuo, Japan surrendered to the Allied Powers on August 15. Japan signed the surrender paper on September 2. This officially ended the Pacific War and World War II.

Hiroshima and Nagasaki were chosen for several reasons. First, both cities were unsuitable for firebombing, mainly due to the river deltas preventing firestorms from being very effective. Second, both cities had areas which provided a good measurement for damage caused by the nuclear bombs. Third and finally, both cities contained strategic personnel and installations; Hiroshima was the headquarters of the 2nd General Army and 5th Division with 40,000 Japanese combatants stationed within the city's limit, and Nagasaki contained two large Mitsubishi armament factories and many other medium-to-small workshops and plants providing vital war components for Japan's war machine.

Several other cities were selected for similar reasons and some of those were rejected due to bad weather. As with other Japanese cities, these targets were mixed in with civilian homes, schools, and temples. Sources said that at least 54% of the deaths in Hiroshima were combatants and slave laborers while 72% of the deaths in Nagasaki were war industry employees and slave laborers, however these figures at various points mix soldiers, enslaved POWs and victims of Japanese occupations and do not necessarily correspond to the overall population of the cities and the overall casualties

Many say that the atomic bombs actually saved many lives in the long run because it prevented the invasion of Japan.  However, Japan had lost a huge part of its food resources and the majority of its navy.  Many of these people suggest that Japan may have lacked the strength to carry out major fighting.  US military commanders made statements during and immediately after 1945 that they believed Japan was effectively defeated prior to the dropping of the bomb.  Before the bombs, Japan offered to surrender, on condition that their leaders had to stay in charge.  America said the Emperor of Japan leader could stay in power, but the Japanese had to take orders from American soldiers placed in Japan, making it an occupied territory.  More people would have been killed in a full battle in Japan.  Some give different guesses of deaths in an invasion and deaths by the atomic bombs, and say that the bombings were not necessary. People still argue about this.  No nuclear weapon has ever been used against a target since August 9, 1945.

The decision to use nuclear weapons on Japan was made after an analysis showed that more than a million people—combatants and civilians of both nations—would die if Japan was invaded by Allied forces. The nuclear bombings, while shocking and unprecedented, actually paled in comparison with the Operation Meetinghouse firebombing of Tokyo on March 9/10, 1945, which killed 100,000 civilians and destroyed 16 square miles in a single night. Doing nothing or waiting for surrender was not an option because hundreds of thousands of combatants, civilians, and prisoners of war were dying each month in the territories of the Empire of Japan.

Partly because of the atomic bombings, Japan adopted the Three Non-Nuclear Principles after the war. These principles said that Japan could not create or try to get nuclear weapons. A scientist Albert Einstein wrote a letter about the atomic bomb on August 2, 1939. But he said later, "I made one great mistake in my life, when I signed a letter to President Roosevelt recommending that atom bombs be made."

Sir William Schwenck Gilbert (18 November 1836 – 29 May 1911) was an English dramatist, librettist, poet and illustrator. He is best known for the comic operas (or operettas) that he wrote with Sir Arthur Sullivan.

Gilbert worked in the civil service for a few years, but he did not like it. He studied law and became a lawyer, but not many people hired him. To make more money, he wrote short stories and comic poems for magazines. He also worked as a theatre critic. Gilbert made drawings for some of his poems and signed them "Bab", a nickname he had when he was a baby. Those poems became known as "The Bab Ballads" and were very popular.

In the 1860s Gilbert started writing plays. At first he wrote parodies of other writers' plays and operas, but soon he developed his own way of writing. Gilbert wrote many plays; most of them are not performed anymore, but Engaged (1877), about a man who proposes marriage to every woman he meets, is still performed.

In 1871 Gilbert started working with Sullivan. They wrote fourteen comic operas together; Gilbert wrote the words and Sullivan wrote the music. Their fourth opera, H.M.S. Pinafore (1878), made the team of "Gilbert and Sullivan" famous all over the English-speaking world. Besides Pinafore, their best-known operas are The Pirates of Penzance (1879) and The Mikado (1885). The Gilbert and Sullivan operas are still performed very often, by opera companies, theatre companies, and groups in schools and colleges.

Gilbert and Sullivan sometimes argued about what to write and how to write it, but they worked together for 25 years, from 1871 to 1896. When they were angry with each other, they wrote operas with other people, but those operas did not make as much money as the operas they wrote together. When Sullivan died in 1900, Gilbert stopped writing operas.

Gilbert directed his own plays and operas. He wanted the actors to talk in a natural way, and not shout as if they were giving a speech to a big crowd. Gilbert's ideas helped other playwrights, like Oscar Wilde and George Bernard Shaw, to make their plays more real.

[[Facebook]]

CATEGORIES: 2004 establishments in the United States, Social networking, Technology, Websites

Facebook (sometimes shortened to FB) is a social networking service and website started in February 2004. It was built by Mark Zuckerberg. It is owned by Facebook, Inc. September 2012, Facebook has over one billion active users. Users may make a personal profile, add other users as friends, and send messages. Facebook users must register before using the site. The name of the service comes from the name for the book given to students at the start of the school year by some universities in the United States. These books help students get to know each other better. Facebook allows any users who are at least 13 years old to become users of the website.

Facebook was started by Mark Zuckerberg with his college roommates and fellow computer science students Eduardo Saverin, Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes. The website's membership was only for Harvard students at first. Later it included other colleges in the Boston area, the Ivy League, and Stanford University. It eventually opened for students at other universities. After that, it opened to high school students, and, finally, to anyone aged 13 and over. Based on ConsumersReports.org in May 2011, there are 7.5 million children under 13 with accounts. This breaks the website's rules.

A January 2009 Compete.com study ranked Facebook as the most used social networking service by worldwide monthly active users. Entertainment Weekly put the site on its end-of-the-decade "best-of" list. It said, "How on earth did we stalk our exes, remember our co-workers birthdays, bug our friends, and play a rousing game of Scrabulous before Facebook?" Quantcast estimates Facebook had 138.9 million monthly different U.S. visitors in May 2011. According to Social Media Today, in April 2010 about 41.6% of the U.S. population had a Facebook account. Facebook's growth started to slow down in some areas. The site lost 7 million active users in the United States and Canada in May 2011 relative to previous statistics.

[[Pubic hair]]

CATEGORIES: Hair

Pubic hair is hair which covers the area around the sex organs. It is generally darker in color and stronger in texture than other hair found on the human body. It is caused by the rising levels of androgens during puberty. Pubic hair is a secondary sex characteristic.

Pubic hair appears during puberty in girls and boys. Beginning with only a few hairs, the area quickly fills out in a triangular shape, making a thick patch of hair. 

The growth of hair can go up toward the navel, but will always continue to grow down past the pubic region and ending at the anus (the hole between the buttocks). In females, hair will cover the outer lips of the vagina; in males, hair will grow around the base of the penis and lightly cover the scrotum (the outer sack containing the testicles).

Pubic hair is sometimes called a "bush," "nest," "pubes," or "curlies". On Asian people, pubic hair is usually not so curly.

Pubic hair is sometimes made into a fashion item. Men and women do this. Some people may change the way their pubic hair looks, by trimming or shaping it. One style is called a "landing strip", like a runway where an airplane lands. Some religions say to shave pubic hair.December 2018 Some people use chemicals that dissolve pubic hair. Some people use wax or electrolysis to remove pubic hair. The use of wax to remove all pubic hair is sometimes called Brazilian.

Sometimes people change the color. Sometimes people ask, "Does the carpet match the drapes?" This means, "Is the person's pubic hair the same color as the hair on the person's head?" Usually people with red natural hair color have darker red pubic hair.

[[Port wine]]

CATEGORIES: Wine

Port wine (also called  Vinho do Porto, Oporto', 'Porto, and often simply Port) is a Portuguese wine. 

Porto is a fortified wine. This means its alcohol is stronger than ordinary wine. This has the effect of making the wine long-lasting even after the bottle has been opened. Porto is a sweet wine, but comes as dry or semi-dry also. It is often served as a dessert wine.

Port is made in the Douro Valley in the northern provinces of Portugal.  Wines which are similar to the Portuguese product called port are made in several countries around the world. The biggest producers are Australia, South Africa, India, Canada and the United States. However, under European Union guidelines, only the product from Portugal may be labelled as Port. In the United States, Federal law mandates that the Portuguese-made product be labeled Porto or Vinho do Porto.

Port is produced from grapes grown and processed in the Douro region. The Douro valley where Port wine is produced was defined and established as a protected region, or appellation in 1756. It is the oldest defined and protected wine region in the world.

The wine produced is then fortified with the addition of a Brandy (distilled grape spirits). This is done to stop the fermentation leaving residual sugar in the wine and to increase the alcohol content.  The wine is then stored and aged. For ageing, it is often put in barrels stored in caves After aging, it is  bottled.  

The wine got its name, "Port," in the second half of the 17th century from the seaport city of Porto at the mouth of the Douro River.  Much of the product was brought there. It was then either sold on a market or exported to other countries in Europe.

[[Quantum immortality]]

CATEGORIES: Quantum mechanics, Suicide

Quantum suicide is a thought experiment in quantum mechanics and the philosophy of physics. It was originally claimed that it can distinguish between the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics and the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. It is based on imagining oneself as the cat in the Schrödinger's cat thought experiment. Quantum immortality refers to the experience of surviving quantum suicide.

The thought experiment was created by Max Tegmark. In the thought experiment, a person stands in front of a gun which fires if it detects a subatomic particle as having an upward spin, or does not fire if the gun detects a downward spin. The gun does this repeatedly. From an outside perspective, both outcomes are equally likely. However, according to the thought experiment, if the many-worlds interpretation is true, the person in front of the gun finds that the gun never fires, even though this is very, very unlikely. In the many-worlds interpretation, the gun fires in one world and does not fire in another, but the person can only continue being conscious in a world in which the gun does not fire. According to the thought experiment, such a person would find themselves to be immortal.

In response to questions about whether people should generally expect to be immortal, Max Tegmark stated that is flawed reasoning because dying is not an instantaneous event, and "fully dead" and "fully alive" are not the only possible outcomes, as in the thought experiment. Rather, it is a progressive process, with a continuous series of states of decreasing consciousness. In most real causes of death, one's self-awareness fades out gradually. It is only within this specific imaginary scenario that a person finds themselves surviving.

Most experts believe that the experiment would not actually work in the real world.371

Max Tegmark now believes that from their own point of view, the person in the thought experiment should not expect immortality. Since they die in some worlds, they afterwards exist in much fewer worlds than they had before. People are less likely to find themselves in a world where their own existence is less likely. Therefore, it is only a possibility, not a certainty, that the person who does the experiment then goes on to feel like they survived. This same problem, of not existing as much afterwards, was pointed out by Lev Vaidman in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.

Physicist David Deutsch, though in favor of the many-worlds interpretation, states regarding quantum suicide that it would not work under the normal probability rules of quantum mechanics. Instead, one would need to add an additional assumption of ignoring worlds where the experimenter is not there. He believes that assumption is false. Physicist David Wallace argues that a decision theory analysis shows that a person who prefers certain life to certain death must prefer to keep themselves alive in worlds that are more likely outcomes, not just in less likely ones.

Physicist Sean M. Carroll, though also in favor of the many-worlds interpretation, states about quantum suicide that neither experiences nor rewards should be thought of as being shared between future versions of oneself, because these future versions become distinct persons when the world splits. He then states that a person cannot pick out some future versions of oneself as really being oneself and not the others. He concludes that quantum suicide kills some of these future selves, which is a bad thing the same as if there were no other worlds.

Shangrila Resort Hotel was founded by the late Brig.(Retd) Muhammad Aslam Khan, the first commander of the Northern Scouts who liberated the Northern Areas in 1948.

Shangrila was named after a book titled "Lost Horizon" by James Hilton. In the novel, the author narrates a tale in which an aeroplane crash landed near a riverbed, in the early 1920s. The surviving passengers came across some Buddhist monks from a nearby temple and sought their help. They were taken to a beautiful lamasery filled with a variety of fruits and flowers. The monks looked quite young, although they claimed to be hundreds of years old. The idyllic place was called Shangri-la, a Chinese word meaning "Heaven on earth".

[[Baltoro Glacier]]

CATEGORIES: Glaciers of Pakistan

The Baltoro Glacier, at 62 kilometers long, is one of the longest glaciers outside of the polar regions. It is in Baltistan, in the Northern Areas of Pakistan, and runs through part of the Karakoram mountain range. The Baltoro Muztagh is to the north and east of the glacier, while the Masherbrum Mountains lie to the south. At 8,611 m (28,251 ft), K2 is the highest mountain in the region, and three others within 20 km top 8,000 m. 

The glacier gives rise to the Shigar River, which is a tributary of the Indus River. Several large tributary glaciers feed the main Baltoro glacier, including the Godwin Austen Glacier, flowing south from K2; the Abruzzi and the various Gasherbrum Glaciers, flowing from the Gasherbrum group of peaks; the Vigne Glacier, flowing from Chogolisa, and the Yermandendu Glacier, flowing from Masherbrum. The confluence of the main Baltoro Glacier with the Godwin Austen Glacier is known as Concordia; this location and K2 base camp are popular trekking destinations.

The trough of this glacier is very wide. Small valley glaciers form icefalls where they meet the trunk glacier. The sidewalls vary from very steep to precipitous. The glacier has carved striations on the surrounding country rocks. Moving ice has formed depressions, which serve as basins for numerous glacial lakes.

The glacier can be approached via the important Balti town of Skardu.

[[Biafo Glacier]]

This 100 km highway of ice connects two ancient mountain kingdoms, Nagar (immediately south of Hunza) in the west with Baltistan in the east. The extreme steepness of the hillsides and strenuous nature of the boulder hopping on the lateral moraines and hillsides make this route's upper half the most difficult part of the Biafo - Hispar traverse. Only the Hispar La day includes walking on the Hispar Glacier. The crossing of four major tributary glaciers from the north is most taxing, and potentially high nullah crossings can be dangerous. The views of 7,800 meter (25,600 foot) peaks and of the snow covered cliffs and mountains on the south side of the glacier are particularly impressive.

Haunted houses are common in gothic fiction, and are generally seen as old castles or creaky, old, abandoned houses. A haunted house can be a type of attraction in amusements parks too. One scientific explanation of haunted houses is that poisonous gasses such as carbon monoxide from defective gas-burning appliances are what causes the hallucinations that people experience. Another possible cause is infrasound.

Pegasus (Πήγασος, Pégasos, 'strong') is a flying horse with wings in Greek mythology. He is the son of Poseidon and the Gorgon Medusa. In cartoons and other stories, Pegasus was said to be the horse of the legendary hero Hercules.

The myth of the Pegasus is interesting and educational, and helps us understand an era gone by.

The Pegasus is a white horse with wings that can fly. It is very beautiful, and can only be controlled with a golden bridle given to Bellerophon by Athena.

Long ago, Perseus killed the monster Medusa using a reflective shield and winged sandals. He cut off her head, which had the hair of poisonous snakes and was so ugly it would turn to stone anyone who looked at it straight on, and from her blood sprang the winged horse Pegasus. Some stories say that Perseus rode Pegasus away, but other stories say he left before Pegasus was born. 

Years later, there was a young man named Bellerophon, living in Corinth. Bellerophon had always longed to ride Pegasus, but Pegasus refused to be tamed. Bellerophon decided to pray to Athena, who was the Greek goddess of wisdom. Athena gave him a golden bridle that allowed him to capture Pegasus.

Later, the brother of a king sent Bellerophon on a quest to defeat the Chimera, a legendary beast with the head of a lion that breathed fire, a goat’s head sprouting from its back, and the tail of a snake. Together, they defeated it and Bellerophon was honored. Then Bellerophon decided he wanted to be immortal and tried to fly with Pegasus to Mount Olympus, home of the gods. Zeus, angry, sent a gadfly to sting Pegasus, who bucked Bellerophon back to Earth.

[[Spectral bat]]

CATEGORIES: Bats

The genus Vampyrum contains only one species, the Spectral bat (V. spectrum). Some alternate names for this species are 'Linnaeus's False vampire bat' and the 'Spectral Vampire bat'. Confusingly, they are not related to the Old World family of large carnivorous bats to be found in the Megadermatidae that are also called false vampires. The animals occur in South America, and Trinidad and Tobago.

This species is the largest bat (Chiroptera) in the New World. Its wingspan is about 80 cm (almost 3 feet). Body length and weight are 125-35 mm and 145-190 grams respectively. Some animals reach wingspans of over a metre. The fur on the upper parts of the bat is normally brown or rust-orange and quite short. The ears are very long and rounded. The large feet are robust, with long curved claws. The muzzle is long and narrow, and the teeth are strong. The Noseleaf is shaped as in the photograph. 

The bats are very good at hunting at night. They are predators. Their prey includes many vertebrates, such as amphibians, reptiles, small birds and mammals- they even hunt other bat species. Insects are also included, especially large crickets, cicadas etc. Surprisingly, a small amount of fruit is also eaten.

When hunting, this species is extremely stealthy. It will often pounce from a position on an above branch onto its prey or fly like some owls by patrolling back and forth along forest edges, suddenly dropping on something in the grass. One young or pup is produced each year, and the mother is very attentive and gentle with her offspring. The male is always in attendance too and will frequently sleep with both mother and young completely wrapped in his wings.

[[Millvina Dean]]

CATEGORIES: Deaths from pneumonia, Infectious disease deaths in England, People from Devon, RMS Titanic survivors, 1912 births, 2009 deaths

Elizabeth Gladys Millvina Dean (February 2, 1912 - May 31, 2009) was, at age 97, the last living survivor of the sinking of the RMS Titanic that occurred April 15, 1912. She was the youngest person to be on the ship, and did not remember anything about the sinking.

She was two months old when she went on the Titanic with her mother, father, and brother. When the Titanic hit an iceberg, her father felt it and told his wife to get her children dressed and go to the deck, or front, of the ship. Dean, her mother, and her brother all got into a lifeboat and got away from the sinking Titanic. Her father did not survive.

Dean started to take part in Titanic-related activities when she was in her seventies, and did not like it when forms of entertainment use the Titanic. The only Titanic movie she watched was A Night to Remember, and she hated it as it was too painful for her to watch.

She became the last living Titanic survivor when Barbara West died on 16 October 2007. West, unlike Dean, did not want any publicity from the Titanic.

CATEGORIES: 2008 in Europe, 2000s in Russia, Abkhazia, History of Georgia (country), South Ossetia, Wars involving Russia

The 2008 South Ossetia war was a military conflict that started on 8 August 2008, between Georgia, South Ossetian (and Abkhazian) secessionists and Russia.

South Ossetia and Abkhazia are territories within Georgia that declared independence from Georgia and have been acting in a de facto independent capacity since the early 1990s. Neither state has been diplomatically recognised by any member of the United Nations. The conflict began on August 8, 2008, after Georgia claimed South Ossetian separatists had broken a ceasefire by attacking villages, although South Ossetian officials deny that they attacked villages. Georgia launched a military offensive to surround and capture the capital of South Ossetia, Tskhinvali.

Russian military troops entered the war at the side of South Ossetia and won the conflict. Georgia launched the Georgia versus Russia (Hague court application, 2008)

in the International Court of Justice.

The war ended on Saturday August 16th, 2008.

[[Horst-Wessel-Lied]]

CATEGORIES: History of Germany, Nazism

The Horst-Wessel-Lied ("Horst Wessel Song"), also known as Die Fahne hoch ("The flag on high", from its opening line), was the anthem of the Nazi Party from 1930 to 1945. From 1933 to 1945 it was also part of Germany's national anthem.

The lyrics of the song were composed in 1929 by Horst Wessel, a Nazi activist and local commander of the Nazi militia, the SA, in the Berlin district of Friedrichshain. Wessel was assassinated by a Communist activist in January 1930, and the propaganda apparatus of Berlin Gauleiter Dr Joseph Goebbels made him the leading martyr of the Nazi Movement. The song became the official Song of Consecration (Weihelied) for the Nazi Party, and was much used at party functions and sung by the SA during street parades.

When the Nazis came to power in 1933, the Horst-Wessel-Lied was recognised as a national symbol by a law issued on May 19, 1933. Nazi Germany thus had a double anthem, consisting of the first verse of the Deutschlandlied followed by the Horst Wessel-Lied. A regulation attached to a printed version of the Horst Wessel-Lied in 1934 required the right arm to be raised in a "Hitler salute" when the first and fourth verses were sung.

With the fall of the Nazi regime in 1945, the Horst-Wessel-Lied was banned, and both the lyrics and the tune remain illegal in Germany and Austria to this day except for educational and scholarly uses (under sections 86 and 86a of the Strafgesetzbuch).

[[Platform game]]

CATEGORIES: Platform games, Types of video games, Video game genres

A platform game, or platformer, is a genre of video game. Platformer gameplay is about jumping between platforms or over obstacles. The player controls these jumps and must use skill to avoid their character falling off of platforms or missing jumps.  This kind of gameplay, even in other genres, is called "platforming". Games where jumping is not controlled by the player, such as The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, are not thought of as platform games.

Platform games began as 2D in the early 1980s, and 3D platformers became popular in the mid-1990s. The name describes games where jumping on platforms is a large part of the gameplay. However, platforming is not a pure genre, and often there are other types of genres mixed into it. For example, in a game like Metroid, the player controls a character not only to navigate obstacles, but to fight enemies.

As long as the actually jumping remains a main part of the gameplay, the game can still correctly be called a platformer. Because of this, there are many different types of platformers.

Each proposition must have some form of the verb 'to be' in it. A categorical syllogism is like a little machine built of three parts: the major premise, the minor premise and the conclusion. Each of these parts is a proposition and, from the first two, the "truth value" of the third part is decided.

[[Selling out]]

CATEGORIES: Music industry, Popular culture

Selling out means giving away one's integrity, morality and principles in exchange for money, 'success' or other personal gain. Some people think that it happens in art when what they think is weird becomes more like mainstream society, so it will make more money. Selling out is seen as getting success at the cost of credibility.

CATEGORIES: Constellations, Constellations listed by Ptolemy

Hercules is a constellation in the northern part of the sky. It represents the mythological Hercules of Greek mythology. It was one of the 48 constellations listed by an astronomer known as Ptolemy around the year 150 CE. It is now one of the 88 modern constellations on the International Astronomical Union's list.

[[Aquila (constellation)]]

CATEGORIES: Constellations, Constellations listed by Ptolemy

Aquila is a constellation. The name means 'eagle' in Latin. The constellation is normally represented as an eagle.

Aquila is just a few degrees North of the celestial equator. The constellation is best seen in the summer as it is along the Milky Way. Because of this location along the line of our galaxy, many clusters and nebulae are within its borders. However, they are dim and there are not many galaxies.

[[Libra (constellation)]]

CATEGORIES: Constellations, Constellations listed by Ptolemy

Libra (ˈliːbrə, weighing scale, symbol , Unicode ♎) is a constellation of the zodiac. It lies between Virgo to the west and Scorpius to the east. It once represented the claws of Scorpius.

[[Scorpius]]

CATEGORIES: Constellations, Constellations listed by Ptolemy

Scorpius (Latin for scorpion, symbol , Unicode ♏) is one of the constellations of the zodiac. In western astrology it is also known as "Scorpio". It is a large constellation in the Southern Hemisphere near the center of the Milky Way.

[[Sagittarius (constellation)]]

CATEGORIES: Constellations, Constellations listed by Ptolemy

The constellation Sagittarius (meaning "the Archer") is a group of stars in one area of the night sky. The stars are in the shape of a centaur archer. This constellation is part of the Western zodiac.

The Milky Way is at its densest near Sagittarius, as this is where the galactic center lies. Consequently, Sagittarius contains many star clusters and nebulae. One of the brightest of the star clusters is Messier 55, about 7.5° west of δ Sgr.

The complex radio source Sagittarius A is here. Astronomers believe that one of its components, known as Sagittarius A*, is associated with a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy, with a mass of 2.6 million solar masses.

[[Ursa Major]]

CATEGORIES: Constellations, Constellations listed by Ptolemy

Ursa Major is a constellation that can be seen in the northern hemisphere and part of the southern hemisphere. Its name means Great Bear in Latin. It was named that because many different groups of people around the world have thought that its stars look a lot like a bear with a long tail. It is often used as a symbol for north.

According to Greek mythology, Ursa Major was once the beautiful maiden Callisto, whom the god Zeus had an affair with. In order to protect her and their son, Arcas, from his jealous wife Hera, Zeus turned Callisto and Arcas into bears. He then picked up the bears by their short, stubby tails and threw them into the sky.

[[Ursa Minor]]

CATEGORIES: Constellations, Constellations listed by Ptolemy

Ursa Minor is a constellation in the northern sky. It is often called the Little Bear or the Little Dipper. Just like the related constellation Ursa Major, or the Big Bear or Big Dipper, it seems to have a long handle leading to a cup or ladle. The end of the handle is the North Star, called Polaris.

The ancient astronomer Ptolemy included Ursa Minor in his list of 48 constellations. It is now one of the 88 modern constellations. Ursa Minor is special because it includes the north celestial pole. However, this will change after several hundred years because the Earth will change the direction of its axis. That movement is called precession

[[Polaris (star)]]

CATEGORIES: Northern pole stars, Variable stars, Binary stars

Polaris (Alpha Ursae Minoris) is the Pole Star or North Star. 

It is the brightest star in the constellation Ursa Minor. It is almost straight above Earth's North Pole. Because of this, when it is seen from Earth, it looks like it always stays in the same place in the sky. For centuries, sailors in the northern hemisphere used Polaris to help them figure out where they were on the ocean and what way they were moving.

Polaris is part of a triple star system. It has a very close dwarf binary, and a larger star, Polaris B, which orbits 2,400 AU away.

The main star, Polaris A, is a giant with 4.5 times the mass of the Sun and a diameter of 45 million kilometers. It is a classic Cepheid variable, the closest to us in the whole Milky Way. Polaris B can be seen even with a modest telescope. It was found by William Herschel in 1780 using one of the most powerful telescopes of the time: his own reflecting telescope. The nearby dwarf star, Ab, was predicted in 1929, but only seen quite recently. The dwarf orbits as close to A as Uranus is to our sun.

Even though Polaris is the North Star today, this has not always been the case. The place in the sky that the Earth's north pole points at changes slowly over time. This movement is called stellar precession. In 3000 BC, a faint star called Thuban in the constellation of Draco was the North Star. Polaris did not become the North Star until about AD 500. It will get closer to straight above the Earth's north pole until sometime in 2102. Then it will move away again. It will be the closest star to the pole until about AD 3000.

Surprisingly, considering its relative nearness, its distance is not yet known for certain. Many recent papers calculate the distance to Polaris at about 434 light-years (133 parsecs). However, some suggest it may be as much as 30% closer. If correct, this would be especially notable because Polaris is the closest Cepheid variable to Earth. Its physical parameters are critical to the whole astronomical distance scale.

There is no star in the southern hemisphere  which plays a similar role to Polaris.

[[Hypercube]]

CATEGORIES: Shapes

An n-dimensional hypercube is also called an n''-cube''' or an n-dimensional cube'.  The term "measure polytope" is also used, notably in the work of H. S. M. Coxeter (originally from Elte, 1912), but it has now been superseded.

The hypercube is the special case of a hyperrectangle (also called an n-orthotope).

A unit hypercube is a hypercube whose side has length one unit.  Often, the hypercube whose corners (or vertices) are the 2n points in Rn with each coordinate equal to 0 or 1 is called "the" unit hypercube.

[[Iron Man 2]]

CATEGORIES: 2010s superhero movies, Marvel Cinematic Universe movies, Movies directed by Jon Favreau, Iron Man movies, Drone movies

Iron Man 2 is a 2010 American superhero movie. It is based on the Marvel Comics character Iron Man. It is the sequel to the 2008 movie Iron Man and the third movie for the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

It was directed by Jon Favreau and written by Justin Theroux. It stars Robert Downey, Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, Scarlett Johansson, Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke. The story is set six months after the events of Iron Man. Tony Stark has revealed his identity as Iron Man. He is resisting calls by the United States government to hand over the technology. Ivan Vanko, meanwhile, has developed the same technology and built weapons of his own.

After the successful release of Iron Man, Marvel Studios announced and immediately set to work on producing a sequel. In July of that same same year, Theroux was hired to write the script. Favreau was signed to return and direct. Downey and Paltrow were to repeat their roles from Iron Man. Cheadle was brought in to replace Terrence Howard in the role of James Rhodes. In early 2009, Rourke, Rockwell and Johansson completed the supporting cast. The movie went into production that summer. Like its predecessor, the movie was shot mostly in California, except for a key sequence in Monaco.

CATEGORIES: 1973 movies, American animated movies, American family movies, American musical movies, Movies about spiders, Movies based on books, Pulitzer Prize winners

Charlotte's Web is a 1973 animated movie, based on the book from 1952 with the same name by E. B. White. It was made into an animated musical movie by Hanna Barbera Productions and Sagittarius Productions in 1973. The movie, sent to theaters by Paramount Pictures on March 1, 1973, is the first of only three Hanna Barbera movies not based upon one of their famous television cartoons. The song score of music and lyrics was written by the Sherman Brothers.

The movie has stayed popular over the years because of television and VHS; in 1994 the movie became one of the best selling movies of the year, 21 years after its first premiere. No other non-Disney musical animated movie has become so popular again later. This new popularity helped to create a direct-to-video sequel, Charlotte's Web 2: Wilbur's Great Adventure, which Paramount released in the US on March 18, 2003 (Universal released the movie internationally), followed by a live-action movie version of E. B. White's original story, which was released on December 15, 2006. The movie was presented by Pulitzer Prize in 1985, the year in which author E. B. White died. E. B. White himself wrote about it.

[[Sphinx]]

A sphinx is a mythological figure, which looks like a lion with a human head. It dates back to the Old Kingdom of Egypt, and its name comes from the Ancient Greek name for a "stranger". The Sphinx is also common in South and South-East Asia, and was popular in Europe from the times of the Renaissance. The Sphinx was famous for posing riddles. It was used to protect the pyramids of Giza. Giza has ahead of a man and the body of a lion. One notable sphinx appears in the legend of Oedipus and killed travellers who failed to correctly answer a riddle about the three ages of man ("Which creature has one voice, but travels on four legs in the morning, two in the afternoon and three in the evening?"). Oedipus correctly solved it ("Man-he crawls on all fours as a baby, in adulthood, he walks upright, and in old age, he walks with a cane"). e

[[Cyclic redundancy check]]

CATEGORIES: Computing, Binary arithmetics

A Cyclic redundancy check (often shortened to CRC) is a way to calculate a checksum, based on a polynomial. In computer science, CRCs are used to check that no errors occurred transmitting the data. The transmitted messages are divided into predetermined lengths which, used as dividends, are divided by a fixed divisor. The remainder of the calculation is appended onto and sent with the computer recalculates the remainder. If it does not match the transmitted remainder, an error is detected. At this point, the data is re-sent. Ethernet packets have a (CRC) code.  

For example: 

If 'm' is your message of 16 bits, and you are calculating a CRC of 8 bits (CRC-8), then let 'x' be message 'm' appended by 7 zeroes. Let 'y' be a "magic" number. Divide 'x' by 'y', until you obtain a remainder that is not divisible further. Take this remainder and subtract it from the "magic" number 'y' and add this result to 'x' to obtain 'z'. 'z' is now a multiple of the "magic" number 'y' and dividing 'z' by 'y' will give a zero remainder. 'z' can now be transmitted to the receiver. The receiver will perform this division and check if the remainder is zero to confirm that there were no errors in transmission. The message can be recovered by simply reading the most significant 16 bits in the 24 bit transmission. 

In real world systems, these long division operations are performed in hardware by bit-shifting and XORing, a feat which is trivial for digital electronics to perform at extremely high speeds.

[[Padded cell]]

CATEGORIES: Psychology

A padded cell is a special room in a hospital for mentally ill people. It's made so that the patients can be put there when they go through a crisis (or they have a fit or seizure). They are put there so they can go through their crisis on their own, without putting others into danger. Padded cells are made in special ways so that those having the crisis cannot hurt themselves. Padded cells have been used for a long time in psychiatry. In the 1980s, their use declined in Europe. This is because there are drugs that can be given that make them nearly unnecessary. 

They are still widely used, especially in Africa and Asia. 

Seizures and crises are usually very tiring. For this reason, patients usually only spend a short time in these cells. They usually collapse because of fatigue rather quickly. When they do, they need medical attention quickly.

[[Menoitios]]

CATEGORIES: Greek mythology

Menoitios (or Menoetius) was the Titan god (perhaps) of violent anger, rash action, and human mortality. Zeus struck him down with a thunderbolt and sent him to Erebos (the Underworld) as punishment for his hybristic behaviour.

He was a son of Iapetus and Clymene or Asia, and a brother of Atlas, Prometheus and Epimetheus. He was struck by Zeus with a flash of lightning, in the fight of the Titans, and thrown into Tartarus but he was not killed. (Hes. Theog. 507, &c., 514; Apollod. i. 2. § 3; Schol. ad Aeschyl. Prom. 347.)

The name Menoitios was derives from the Greek words menos meaning variously might, force, spirit, passion, batterage, and oitos meaning ill-fated or doomed. Hesiod also describes him as hybristes, a violent, overbearing and insolent man. Menoitios and his brothers, the sons of Iapetos, were all depicted with extreme human foibles: Prometheus was overly crafty, Epimetheus a fool, and Atlas exceedingly daring.

Menoitios was perhaps identical to Menoites the herdsman of Hades, whom Herakles wrestled with in the underworld. This connection with cattle, suggests that he was also the same as Bouphagos (the Cattle Eater) son of Iapetos, a hybristic man who attacked the goddess Artemis in Arkadia.

[[Cod wars]]

CATEGORIES: History of international relations, Fishing, 1950s in the United Kingdom, 1970s in the United Kingdom, 20th century in Iceland

The Cod Wars, also called the Iceland Cod Wars (Icelandic: Þorskastríðin, "the cod wars", or Landhelgisstríðin, "the wars for the territorial waters") were a series of confrontations in the 1950s and 1970s between the United Kingdom and Iceland regarding fishing rights in the North Atlantic.  The name of the conflict may be derived from a pun on the term "Cold War" (with "cod" reading so similarly to "cold"), possibly via the British tabloid press.

In 1972, Iceland unilaterally declared an Exclusive Economic Zone extending beyond its territorial waters, before announcing plans to reduce over-fishing. It policed its quota system with the coast guard, leading to a series of net-cutting incidents with British trawlers that fished the areas. As a result, a fleet of British Royal Naval warships and tug-boats was employed to act as a deterrent against any future harassment of British fishing crews by the Icelandic craft.

In 1976, a compromise between the two states allowed a maximum of 24 British trawlers access to the disputed 200 nautical mile (370 km) limit.  Two-hundred-nautical-mile Exclusive Economic Zones became recognized internationally on November 14, 1994, after having been agreed at the conference on the Third United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) in 1982.

The constellation has a clear hour-glass shape with "Orion's Belt" in the centre. That part is made up of three bright stars (Alnitak, Alnilam, Mintaka) in line. The Orion constellation has 81 visible stars, including some of the brightest and most important stars in the night sky. Rigel is the brightest star in it, and Betelgeuse is a huge, rather unstable red supergiant. 

The constellation includes a series of starburst nebulae where new stars are forming. The whole group of nebulae is known as the Orion complex. The complex is 1,500 to 1,600 light-years away, and hundreds of light-years across. It includes

[[Betelgeuse]]

CATEGORIES: Red giants, Variable stars, Supergiants

Betelgeuse (from Arabic: إبط الجوزاء Ibṭ al-Jauzā’, meaning "the armpit of Orion") is a large red supergiant star in the Orion constellation. It is usually the ninth-brightest star in the night sky, and the second-brightest in Orion. 

Betelgeuse is a semiregular variable star whose apparent magnitude varies between 0.2 and 1.2. This is the widest range of any first-magnitude star.

It is also one of the largest and most luminous observable stars. It has a radius between 950 to 1,000 times wider than the Sun. This means it is 1.322 to 1.392 billion kilometers in diameter. Betelgeuse was the first star other than the Sun whose size was known. The star's distance from Earth is about 640 light-years. Its average absolute magnitude is about −6.02. 

Betelgeuse is less than 10 million years old. It evolves rapidly because of its high mass. It is moving through the interstellar medium at a speed of 30 km/s, creating a shock wave over 4 light-years wide.

Betelgeuse is now in a later stage of stellar evolution. It will rapidly go through its life cycle before exploding as a type II supernova sometime in the next million years. 

An observation by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2013 showed that the star's winds are crashing against the surrounding interstellar medium.

Betelgeuse is one of the red supergiant stars to have a bow shock:  others are Mu Cephei and IRC-10414. Betelgeuse can be seen at the upper left  in Orion.

[[Phoenix (mythology)]]

 The phoenix is ​​the sacred bird of myth, mentioned in Persian, Greek, Egyptian, and Chinese mythology. But once every thousand years, he spreads his wings and sings over a large mass of firewood, and when he is overjoyed by his song, he kindles a fire in his beak, and when it burns in the fire, an egg emerges from it, which immediately catches fire and burns. Another phoenix is ​​born from its ashes. Phoenix is ​​considered a symbol of immortality and longevity in most cultures. But some cultures have attributed other characteristics to him. The story goes that the bird lives for several hundred years before it dies by setting itself on fire. However, it then starts a new life from the ashes of the fire.

Sirius is the brightest star in the night sky. It is a binary star system in Canis Major, near Orion. It has an apparent magnitude of −1.46. The system is between 200 and 300 million years old. It was originally composed of two bright bluish stars.

Sirius appears bright because of its intrinsic luminosity and its position (it is relatively close to Earth). At a distance of 2.6 parsecs (8.6 ly), the Sirius system is one of Earth's near neighbours.

The Egyptians called this star 'Sopdet'. They relied on it to predict when the flood season would start. Sirius is sometimes called the Dog Star. The phrase the dog days of summer means the hottest days of summer.

[[Canopus]]

CATEGORIES: Supergiants

Canopus, or Alpha Carinae in the Bayer designation system, is the brightest star in its constellation (Carina) and the brightest star in the southern night sky.

Canopus is quite unusual, because its distance from Earth was not known until the 1990s. Before the launching of the Hipparcos satellite telescope, distance estimates for the star varied widely, from 96 light years to 1200 light years. Hipparcos established Canopus as lying 310 light years (96 parsecs) from our solar system. 

The difficulty in measuring Canopus' distance stemmed from its being a "less luminous supergiant". Such stars are rare and poorly understood. They are stars that can be either in the process of evolving to or away from red giant status. This in turn made it difficult to know how intrinsically bright Canopus is, and therefore how far away it might be. Direct measurement was the only way to solve the problem. Canopus is too far away for Earth-based parallax observations to be made, so the star's distance was not known with certainty until the early 1990s.

Canopus is 13,600 times more luminous than the Sun and the most intrinsically bright star within about 700 light years. In fact, from 1 astronomical unit, Canopus would have an apparent magnitude of -37. Canopus appears less bright than Sirius in our sky only because Sirius is much closer to the Earth (8.6 light years).

The surface temperature of Canopus is 7350 ± 30 K. Its diameter has been measured at 0.6 astronomical units (the measured angular diameter being 0.006 arcseconds), 65 times that of the Sun. If it were placed at the centre of the solar system, it would extend three-quarters of the way to Mercury. An Earth-like planet would have to lie three times the distance of Pluto for its star to appear the same size in the sky as our own sun. Canopus is a strong source of X-rays, which are probably produced by its corona, magnetically heated to around 15 million K.

Canopus is part of the Scorpius-Centaurus Association, a group of stars which share similar origins.

[[History of colonialism]]

CATEGORIES: History of colonialism

The history of colonialism goes back thousands of years, colonialism is the taking over of one country by another. In ancient times peoples such as the Hittites and the Incas were involved in colonialism.

However people usually use the word colonialism to talk about the European overseas empires rather than land-based empires. Overseas empires include British rule in India and French rule in Algeria - both of which could only be reached by ships.

Land based empires are usually described as imperialism and include:

The Ottoman Empire was created across Mediterranean, North Africa and into Southern Europe and existed during the time of European colonization of the other parts of the world.

European colonialism began in the fifteenth century when the  Spanish and Portuguese began exploring the Americas, and the coasts of Africa, the Middle East, India, and East Asia.

During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, England, France and Holland made their own overseas empires. However the end of the eighteenth and early nineteenth century many European colonies in the Americas gained their independence.

Spain and Portugal became weakened after the loss of their New World colonies and could not get back the power they once had. But Britain, France and Holland turned their attention to South Africa, India and South East Asia and began expanding.

In the nineteenth century Europe underwent industrialisation, the population got larger, armies became more organised and had better weapons produced in factories. This time became known as the era of New Imperialism. Very quickly European powers were able to take over land and included the Scramble for Africa.

After World War I the European countries who had lost the war had to give up their colonies to the countries that had won the war. For instance Britain which won the war took over Tanzania from Germany (which had lost the war)

After World War II however Europe's colonies started to become independent. In 1999 Portugal returned the last of Europe's colonies in Asia, Macau, to China, ending an era that had lasted five hundred years.

He is said to have climbed the tower of St Mary's Parish Church in Market Drayton and sat on a gargoyle, frightening people down below. He also attempted to set up a protection racket enforced by a gang of youths. Faced with the choice of paying up or receiving a visit from Clive and his 'boys', many of Market Drayton's shopkeepers decided to pay. His bad behaviour resulted in him being expelled from three schools, including Market Drayton Grammar School. He also went to Clifton College School. He boarded there for 3 years. 

As an adult Clive worked for the British East India Company. In 1746 he joined the Company army and fought well against the French army in India.

[[Hubble Ultra-Deep Field]]

CATEGORIES: Satellites, Cosmology, Galaxies

The Hubble Ultra Deep Field,  or HUDF, is an image of a small part of space in the direction of the constellation Fornax. 

It took more than 3 months to capture this image, from September 24, 2003 to January 16, 2004. It is the furthest image of the universe ever taken by humans. In it we see the universe as it was 13 billion years ago, when it was about 800 million years old.

The HUDF contains an about 10,000 galaxies. The patch of sky where the galaxies are was chosen because it has few bright stars in the near-field. Although most of the targets visible in the Hubble image can also be seen at infrared wavelengths by ground-based telescopes, Hubble is the only instrument which can make observations of these distant targets at visible wavelengths. 

Southwest of Orion in the Southern-Hemisphere constellation Fornax at right ascension 3h 32m 40.0s, declination -27° 47' 29" (J2000), the image covers 36.7 square arcminutes. This is smaller than a 1 square of paper held 1 away, and equal to roughly one thirteen-millionth of the total area of the sky. The image is such that the upper left corner points toward north (-46.4°) on the celestial sphere. The star near the center of the field is USNO-A2.0 0600-01400432 with apparent magnitude of 18.95.

In total, the image required 800 exposures taken over the course of 400 Hubble orbits around Earth. The total amount of exposure time was 11.3 days for the ACS and 4.5 days for the NICMOS.

[[Sniper]]

CATEGORIES: Military

A sniper is a person who is trained to shoot perfectly at things that are very small or very far away. The sniper's target is usually an enemy. Many military snipers get special training to use a sniper rifle, a special type of gun. Most sniper rifles have a telescope called a sniper scope to help the sniper see the target. Snipers are also trained to be stealthy. Snipers hide or use military camouflage such as a ghillie suit that looks like (and may include some of) the surrounding foliage so that it is hard for the enemy to see them. A sniper is also called a "marksman".

Experienced hunters often share many of the skills that long range shooters need to know. The two jobs are very similar. The word "sniper" came from Britain when highly accurate shooters would hunt–also known as "snipe"–birds that were very hard to see and shoot.

Many police departments have snipers on their SWAT teams. Because police snipers do not always perform the same tasks as military snipers, police snipers are sometimes known as "marksmen".

[[Sniper rifle]]

CATEGORIES: Rifles

A sniper rifle is a type of gun used to accurately shoot targets a long distance away. A person who uses a sniper rifle in the military is called a sniper. 

A sniper rifle is much more accurate than a normal rifle. Almost all sniper rifles use a sniper scope, a special telescope that allows them to see targets very far away. There are two different kinds of sniper rifles: bolt action rifles, which fire a single shot and then the user must ready the next shot, and semi-automatic ("semi-auto") rifles which fire a single shot each time the trigger is pulled, and automatically ready the next shot for firing. Fully automatic rifles, which fire continuously when the trigger is pulled as long as there is ammunition, generally are not used though in rare instances they can be converted into a sniper rifle. In one such instance, a heavy machine gun with a scope, while not a true sniper rifle, set the record for longest kill by a sniper for years, until advances in rifle technology and sniper training allowed a sniper with a true sniper rifle to beat that record.

Typically, bolt-action rifles have a longer range and are more accurate than semi-automatic rifles, however because each round must be chambered by hand, the rate of fire is slower than a semi-automatic rifle, which fires as fast as the shooter can squeeze the trigger. At close ranges, or in situations where a shooter must make a quick follow-up shot, a sniper may prefer to use the semi-automatic rifle instead. Examples of bolt action sniper rifles are the M40, R700, and M24. Examples of semi-automatic ones are the M21, Dragunov, and the M82 Barret .50 caliber.

Sniper rifles range in caliber (the diameter, or width, of the bullet fired in fractions of an inch) from as small as .22 with the .22 LR (long rifle) bullet fired by many small pistols, to as large as .5 with the .50 Browning Machine Gun (BMG) bullet which is fired by vehicle mounted heavy machine guns. Smaller rounds like the .22 LR are often used at very close range with a sound suppressor (commonly called a silencer) to quickly and quietly break street lights or kill vermin and small animals. The round is generally too weak and has too short of a range for longer range work, or shots on human-sized targets. In contrast, large rounds like the .50 BMG are fired out of very large and heavy sniper rifles that are often used for destroying light vehicles and equipment. They can fire at extreme ranges of over a mile, but generally are too bulky, inaccurate at short ranges, and expensive for general purpose work. 

Sniper rifle barrels must be cleaned every day to get rid of any liquid. Not cleaning the barrel can allow to disastrous situations, or even let the barrel explode upon firing.

He was captured and sentenced to prison for 13 years. He was able to escape from HM Prison Pentridge in 1862 and moved to northern Victoria where he met the Kelly, Quinn and Lloyd families. In 1864 he was captured near Beechworth and sent back to prison. He escaped from Pentridge again on 19 February 1869. 

Ned Kelly, who was 13 years old, helped him with several robberies near Beechworth. Power then carried out more than 600 robberies by himself during the year. He had a hideout in a cave looking out over the King River which is still called Power's Lookout. The police offered a reward of ₤500 for his capture. Ned Kelly's uncle, James Quinn, told the police the location of the cave and Power was again caught and sent back to prison.

He was released in 1877 because of concerns for his health. He worked on a farm near Sunbury. In his old age he acted as a guide on a ship set up as a convict museum. On 11 October 1891 he was found drowned in the Murray River, near Swan Hill.

[[Submission (movie)]]

CATEGORIES: 2004 movies, Documentary movies, Dutch movies

Submission was a movie made in 2004. It was directed by Theo van Gogh. Ayaan Hirsi Ali wrote the script. She made the story. The movie is 10 minutes long. The movie title is a direct translation of the word Islam into English.

The movie tells the story of four fictional characters.  All four characters are played by a single actress wearing a veil. The woman wears a see-through chador but is otherwise naked. Different verses of the Qur'an are painted onto her body.

The characters shown in the movie are Muslim women who have been abused in different ways.  For example, one woman has been raped by someone close to her. These women have a monologue - they speak to themselves.

The movie dramatically  highlights three verses of the Quran (4 2 and 24). These verses seem make it permissible  to treat women badly. The authors of the movie show the verses painted on the women's bodies.

Mohammed Bouyeri assassinated Theo van Gogh, after the movie had been shown on Dutch TV. Bouyeri is a Moroccan-Dutch Muslim who was upset about the movie. The assassination happened on 2 November 2004. A letter linked the murder to Van Gogh's movie and his views regarding Islam. It was addressed to Ayaan Hirsi Ali and  called for jihad against kafir. Kafir is an Arabic word for unbeliever, a person who hides, denies, or covers the truth. The letter was also against America, Europe, the Netherlands, and Hirsi Ali herself. After the murder of Van Gogh, tens of thousands gathered in the center of Amsterdam to mourn Van Gogh's death. There were fire-bombings of mosques and Muslim schools. Christian churches were also attacked.  Eleven other Muslim men were also arrested, other than Bouyeri. They were charged with conspiracy to assassinate Hirsi Ali.

After the murder of Theo van Gogh, Submission gained international fame. It was withdrawn from the International Film Festival Rotterdam. The movie had been scheduled to be shown on Sunday during a discussion on freedom of speech in movie at the festival. Because of the violent murder of Van Gogh, the producer of Submission, Gijs van de Westelaken, said, "We do not want to take any chance of endangering anyone else who participated in the movie." The movie was shown on television in a number of European countries.

Hirsi Ali has said she would like to make a sequel to the movie because "By not making 'Submission Part II,' I would only be helping terrorists believe that if they use violence, they're rewarded with what they want." When she was asked if she would submit to threats against her life, she said "Not me."

[[Governor-General of Pakistan]]

CATEGORIES: British India, Governors General of Pakistan

The Governor-General of Pakistan was the resident representative of King George VI in Pakistan from 1947 to 1952 and then Queen Elizabeth II ("Queen of Pakistan") from 1952 until 1956 when Pakistan was proclaimed a republic.

When Pakistan became an independent, self-governing nation in 1947, it, like post-independent India, provisionally continued to use the Government of India Act 1935, as its written constitution until a post-independence constitution could be drafted; by default this contemplated the continuation of the constitutional monarchy as a Commonwealth realm Dominion. 

The monarch appointed a Governor-General, upon the advice of the Prime Minister of Pakistan to serve as de facto Head of State. 

Muhammad Ali Jinnah, considered Quaid-e-Azam ("Great Leader"), informed Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma: "when I am Governor-General the Prime Minister will do what I tell him to" -- however Jinnah's rapidly declining health made the issue moot.

After Jinnah's death the Governor-General of Pakistan continued to serve a larger role than the India Act prescribed, dismissing multiple Prime Ministers and consolidating power.

The office of Governor-General was replaced by the office of President of Pakistan when Pakistan became a republic in 1956. The then Governor-General, Iskander Mirza, became Pakistan's first president.

Glenn Theodore Seaborg (April 19, 1912 - Feb. 25, 1999) was an American chemist. He was born in Ishpening, Michigan. He won the 1951 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Edwin M. McMillan.

In 1980, he changed several thousand atoms of bismuth into gold at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. His experimental technique, using nuclear physics, was able to remove protons and neutrons from the bismuth atom. Seaborg's techique would have cost too much money to make of gold, but his work is the closest to the mythical Philosopher's Stone.

Seaborg worked at the Manhattan Project during World War II. He studied the chemical properties of plutonium as a part of the secret war research.

He served as Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission and was a professor at the University of California, Berkeley.

Seaborg was the principal or co-discoverer of ten elements: plutonium, americium, curium, berkelium, californium, einsteinium, fermium, mendelevium, nobelium and element 106, which was named seaborgium in his honor while he was still living. He also developed more than 100 atomic isotopes. Early in his career, Seaborg was a pioneer in nuclear medicine and developed many isotopes of elements that helped to diagnose and treat diseases. For example, he studied iodine-131, which is used in the treatment of thyroid disease. He developed the actinide concept which placed the actinide series beneath the lanthanide series on the periodic table. Seaborg also proposed the placement of super-heavy elements in the transactinide and superactinide series.

This cat finds shade or digs a burrow during the day and hides from the sunlight underground. It only lives in places where the sand or dirt is loose enough for it to dig.  The sand cat looks for food at night.  It eats rodents, lizards and insects.  It can even hunt and kill snakes.  It does not drink water, taking all its water from eating prey.  It does not need to go near watering holes, so it can avoid bigger predators that might hurt it.  Wolves, snakes, large birds and humans can hurt this cat.

[[Clouded leopard]]

CATEGORIES: Felines

The clouded leopard (Neofelis nebulosa) is a rare cat species. It is a medium-sized felid, found from the Himalayan foothills through mainland Southeast Asia into China. It is 55 to 110 cm (2 ft to 3 ft 6 in) long and weighs between 15 and 23 kg (33 to 50 lb). It is classified as vulnerable in 2008 by IUCN. Its total population may be fewer than 10,000 mature individuals.

Clouded leopards hunt in trees as well as on the ground. Their prey are monkeys and birds. They are one of the few cats who are arboreal.

The genetic analysis of specimens of Neofelis nebulosa and its close relative Neofelis diardi suggests the two species diverged 1.4 million years ago. A group crossed a now submerged land bridge to Borneo and Sumatra from mainland Asia. And, the Sunda clouded leopard is different enough on the two large islands to be classed as two subspecies.

The split between the two subspecies corresponds roughly with the catastrophic eruption of the Toba supervolcano in Sumatra 69,000–77,000 years ago. A probable scenario is that Sunda clouded leopards from Borneo recolonized Sumatra during periods of low sea levels in the Pleistocene, and these were later separated from their source population by rising sea levels.

Report of the Simon Commission, discussions at the Third Round Table Conference, the White Paper of 1933 and the reports of the Joint select committees. This act ended the system of dyarchy introduced by the Government of India Act 1919, and provided for establishment of a Federation of India to be made up of provinces of British India and some or all of the Princely states. However, the federation never came into being as the required number of princely states did not join it.

John Wycliffe (lived from about 1320 to 1384 in England) was an English theologian. He was one of the first to translate the Christian Bible into common English. It is generally known as "Wyclif's Bible". A missions agency bearing his name (Wycliffe Bible Translators) continues translating the scriptures into languages around the world.

Wycliffe wrote that papal claims of temporal power had no foundation in the scriptures and that the scriptures alone should be the standard of Christian belief and practice.

John Wycliffe’s family lived in a lower social class, which meant they did not live in great wealth, but they were not poor either. Later, after Wycliffe had grown up, he attended Oxford University where he earned an arts degree. He became Master of Balliol College, Oxford in 1361. He was also given a parish in Lincolnshire, which meant he had to give up the position of Master. He lived at Oxford for a large portion of his life, and worked as a rector (a member of the clergy) at local churches. There were many more changes to his life. Some of his ideas were in conflict with those of the Church, but he had the support and protection of John of Gaunt, who was ruling England at the time.

Wycliffe encouraged the Church to benefit the sinners of the world by living a life of poverty, but not everyone agreed with his thoughts and ideas. In some of late writings, he wrote that the Bible was the authority of the Christian religion, not of the church. In 1382 Wycliffe’s followers, the lollards, helped him translate the Bible. Early members of the Christian churches called him the first great reformer.

[[Sniper scope]]

CATEGORIES: Firearm components

A sniper scope or telecopic sight is a kind of telescope that is attached to a rifle. These scopes can help a sniper aim and hit a target far away. Usually, they are made of metal, with glass on each end. They show markings to help aim. A rifle scope works by enlarging target area so you can aim more accurately. Scopes differ from iron sights, which are usually used in crossbows or some machine guns.

The scope hasn’t been around forever. In fact, scopes are relatively new inventions, dating back to the late 19th century. A book published in 1844 called the Improved American Rifle documents some of the first rifle markers manufactured in New York. The idea of using a telescope tube came in 10 years later. Willian Malcolm, a New York manufacturer, introduced optics to lenses.

It was during the World War when rifle scopes saw big improvements. With trench warfare came the rise of the snipers.

Back then, 6x magnification was considered a feat. But with today’s technology, we could use even 10x magnification scopes with rifles.

[[Backup]]

CATEGORIES: Computing

In the context of computers and computer systems, a backup is a copy of some data. This copy can be used when the original data is changed, or lost. Losing data is common: A 2008 survey found that two thirds of respondents had lost files on their home PC. Another purpose of backing up data is to have a copy that represents an earlier state of the data, before it was changed. Organisations may have rules which state how long data should be kept, and what kinds of data these rules apply to. In many countries there are rules that specify that certain kinds of data need to be kept for a given time. An example of this is the data used for accounting.

Backups are a simple form of disaster recovery. Even though they are commonly seen as disaster recovery, they should be part of a disaster recovery plan. A disaster recovery plan is a documented set of procedures and tasks to perform to protect the consistency and integrity of a corporate IT system.

[[Dhole]]

CATEGORIES: Canids

The dhole (Cuon alpinus) is a canid from Asia. It is  related to dogs and foxes. It is native to Central, South and Southeast Asia. There are many common names for it: Asiatic wild dog, Indian wild dog, whistling dog, red dog, and mountain wolf.

It is most closely related to species in the genus Canis (dogs and wolves),

During the Pleistocene time period, the dhole lived in Asia, Europe and North America, but 12,000–18,000 years ago it died out everywhere except where it lives now.

The dhole lives in big, loosely organised groups with several breeding females. The groups usually have about 12 dholes, but some have over 40. It is awake in the day and hunts in groups. It usually eats medium sized to big hoofed animals. In tropical forests, the dhole competes with tigers and leopards, targeting somewhat different prey species, but still with substantial dietary overlap.

It is listed as Endangered by the IUCN. The population is getting smaller, and there are probably fewer than 2,500 adults left. The reasons for this are lack of habitat, lack of food, competing with other animals, being hunted, and getting diseases from pet dogs.

[[Menstrual cycle]]

CATEGORIES: Female reproductive system

The menstrual cycle is a process that adult human women can go through. The menstrual cycle for a woman will repeat every 28 days while they are not pregnant. During this time, the women's ovaries create a mature ovum (egg). Then the woman's body prepares for pregnancy by thickening the walls of the uterus. If the woman does not become pregnant during this time, the egg and the lining of the uterus come out of the woman's body during menstruation.

The menstrual cycle process is controlled by four major hormones: FSH (follicle stimulating hormone); LH (luteinising hormone); estrogen; and progesterone. These hormones prepare the uterus to receive a fertilized egg and control its development.

The menstrual cycle has three stages: the Follicular stage, Ovulation, and the Luteal (or premenstrual) stage. The cycle will stop if the woman gets pregnant (if a fertilized egg implants itself into the lining of the uterus).

[[Market share]]

CATEGORIES: Marketing

Market share, in business and marketing, is the portion ('share') of the targeted consumer base ('market') that a company actually reaches, for a particular service or product.

For example, it can be shown as the amount of money a company brings in (revenue) from its consumers, divided by the total amount of money paid from all consumers for that service or product.

It can also be shown as the amount of products/services sold ('unit sales volume') by a company  divided by the total volume sold to all the consumers in that market.

It is necessary to commission (hire) market research (generally desk/secondary research, although sometimes primary research) to estimate the total market size and a company's market share.

Increasing market share is one of the most important objectives in business. The main advantage of using market share is that it removes the effects of industry-wide macroenvironmental variables such as the state of the economy, or changes in tax policy. For example, if you were one of only two psychiatrists in Chicago, then it would not matter how bad the economy was because you would always have a huge slice of the consumer-base "pie" for your service. If your service was less needed, then advertising more would help increase your market share. 

The market shares for different companies tends to change over time, causing change in the market share values; the reason can be political ups and downs, a disaster, etc.

In finance a share is a unit of account for various financial instruments including stocks, mutual funds, limited partnerships, and REIT's. In British English, the usage of the word share alone to refer solely to stocks is so common that it almost replaces the word stock itself.

In simple words, a share or stock is a document issued by a company, which entitles its holder to be one of the owners of the company. A share is issued by a company or can be purchased from the stock market.

By owning a share you can earn a portion and selling shares you get capital gain. So, your return is the dividend plus the capital gain. However, you also run a risk of making a capital loss if you have sold the share at a price below your buying price.

A company's stock price reflects what investors think about the stock, not necessarily what the company is "worth." For example, companies that are growing quickly often trade at a higher price than the company might currently be "worth." Stock prices are also affected by all forms of company and market news.

[[Appendicitis]]

CATEGORIES: Inflammation

Appendicitis is the inflammation of the appendixJanuary 2021. The appendix is a pouch at the start of the large intestine. Symptoms usually include a sharp pain in the lower right abdomen. Also, nausea, vomiting, and decreased appetite are common. However, about 40% of people do not have these typical symptoms. If the appendix ruptures (splits) the result is painful peritonitis, and sepsis. Therefore immediate treatment in hospital is needed for appendicitis. Usually the infected appendix is taken out.

The function of the appendix in apes is the digestion of vegetable matter such as leaves. Humans do not digest leaves, but we inherited some of the apes' vegetarian apparatus. Our appendix is much smaller than that of present-day apes, and for some reason our immune system does not serve it well. An infection there is not eliminated as it might be elsewhere in the body.

The causes of appendicitis include blocking in the appendix, or bacterial infections. If it is not treated, it may lead to peritonitis and shock. Most serious appendicitis happens to younger children and elder adults. Appendicitis is common between the ages of ten and fourteen for males, and fifteen and nineteen for females. The most usual treatment is an appendectomy which means removing the appendix. Sometimes, it gets better without surgery. Some people think that eating vegetables will help, but no chances should be taken. Seek medical advice if in doubt.

Reginald Fitz first described acute appendicitis in 1886. It is one of the leading causes worldwide of "pain in the abdomen", a term used in medicine and surgery to cover a wide range of causes.

[[SWAT team]]

CATEGORIES: Military, Police

A SWAT team is a group of highly trained police officers who deal with very dangerous criminals. SWAT is an acronym that means Special Weapons And Tactics. SWAT officers carry weapons of higher caliber than most police officers do, such as machine guns, shotguns, and sniper rifles. Usually, police departments use SWAT teams to catch people who sell illegal drugs or try to hold people hostage. They also respond to serious crimes like bank robberies when normal police officers cannot control the criminals.

The SWAT teams are usually called to deal with hostage situations.  They plan the entry into the building where the hostages are being held.  They look closely at all building entrances to choose the best option. They make use of equipment such as rappelling ropes, nightvision goggles, thermalvision goggles, a tactical shield, flashbang and smoke grenades, snake cameras small cameras that fit under doors and into very small holes, among others.

SWAT officers act as paramilitary units that tackle situations beyond the capability of conventional police forces. SWAT teams are called in when an incident presents significant risk to law enforcement officers or the public, as in:

While all SWAT officers are expert marksmen with in-depth training in close combat, most play a specialized role within the team. Some serve as negotiators or medics while others are experts in handling assault vehicles or weapons. Each team includes several tactical officers who coordinate and carry out assaults on barricaded positions and apprehend armed suspects.

When not responding to crises, SWAT officers perform more routine duties. Many spend a majority of their time in conventional policing activities such as patrol and traffic enforcement. In some areas, they use their specialized tactical knowledge to conduct crime suppression exercises that ferret out dangerous offenders.

[[Flat Earth]]

CATEGORIES: Earth

The idea of a flat Earth is that the surface of the Earth is flat (a plane). Belief in a flat Earth is found in the oldest writings. Early Mesopotamian maps showed the world  as a flat disk floating in the ocean.

This was a common belief until the Classical Greeks began to discuss the Earth's shape about the 4th century BC. Eratosthenes (276 BC–194 BC) calculated the circumference of the Earth quite well. From then on, few educated people ever believed in its being flat. People first started having the thought that the Earth is round in around 6th century BC. Then, Aristotle proved the Earth was round in around 330 BC.

The large-scale shape of the Earth only matters when considering large distances. Therefore in the Ancient world only sailors, astronomers, philosophers, and theologians would have cared about the Earth's large-scale shape.

The following authors argued for a spherical or ball shaped earth: King Alfred of the Anglo-Saxons, Hildegard von Bingen, Thomas Aquinas, Snorri Sturluson, Marco Polo, Dante Alighieri, Christopher Columbus

Portuguese people explored Africa and Asia, Columbus sailed to the Americas (1492) and Ferdinand Magellan's circumnavigated (sailed all round) the earth (1519-21). This proved finally, in a practical way that the Earth is a globe.

During the 19th century, the Romantic ideas about a European "Dark Age" made the Flat Earth model look much more important than it ever had been in history.

The widely circulated woodcut is of a man poking his head through the firmament of a flat Earth to see the machines working the spheres.  It was made in 16th century style but cannot be traced to an earlier time than Camille Flammarion's L'Atmosphère: Météorologie Populaire (Paris, 1888, p. 163). The woodcut illustrates the statement in the text that a missionary in the middle Ages claimed that "he reached the horizon where the Earth and the heavens met".  That story may be traced back to Voltaire, but not to any known source in the Middle ages. The original woodcut had a decorative border that places it in the 19th century; in later publications, some claimed that the woodcut dated from the 16th century and the border was removed. According to an unproved story Flammarion ordered the woodcut himself; certainly no source of the image earlier than Flammarion's book is known.

An early mention in literature was Ludvig Holberg's comedy Erasmus Montanus (1723). A great many people disagree with Erasmus Montanus when he claims the Earth is round, since all the peasants believe it is flat. He is not allowed to marry his fiancée until he cries "The earth is flat as a pancake". In Rudyard Kipling's The Village that Voted the Earth was Flat, the main characters spread the rumor that a Parish Council meeting had voted in favor of a flat Earth.

Fantasy fiction often imagines a flat Earth. In C. S. Lewis' The Voyage of the Dawn Treader the fictional world of Narnia is "round like a table" (i.e., flat), not "round like a ball", and the characters sail toward the edge of this world. Terry Pratchett's Strata and Discworld novels (1983 onwards) are set on a flat, disc-shaped world resting on the backs of four huge elephants which are in turn standing on the back of an enormous turtle.

With Gardiner and Hall, Gilbert was involved with the biggest gold robbery in Australia's history: in 1862 the gang robbed a coach carrying gold at Eugowra. After the robbery, Gardiner went to Queensland to hide from the police. John Gilbert went to New Zealand. When he came back in May 1863, he started a new gang with Ben Hall.

[[Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]]

CATEGORIES: Mental illnesses

Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), or attention deficit disorder (ADD), is a neurodevelopmental disorder. It affects how people think and act. It affects between 2 to 9.5 percent of school-age children worldwide. Children with ADHD often tend to be disruptive, restless, prone to tantrums, have difficulty completing tasks, and will often become a distraction in the classroom.  

People with ADHD may be too active; they may have trouble sitting still or being quiet. They may be rather impulsive. 

They usually have problems focusing and remembering what is said or done around them. ADHD is called a neurological developmental disorder because it affects how people's nervous systems develop.

Experts think that, throughout the world, about one in twenty children (5%) have ADHD. Some countries have more people with ADHD than others, and not everyone uses the same tests. Psychologists have found more people with ADHD in North America than in Africa and the Middle East. In the United States, about one in every fourteen children has ADHD (7%), including one in every ten boys (10%) and one in every twenty-five girls (4%). This could be because more boys get ADHD, or because fewer girls take ADHD tests.

ADHD is most common in children: fewer adults have ADHD. 

Some (less than half) people with ADHD in childhood find things get better when they are adults. Their symptoms are less noticeable. In some cases the symptoms go away entirely when they reach adulthood.

[[Prevalence]]

[[Ozone]]

CATEGORIES: Chemical elements, Environmental chemistry, Greenhouse gases

Ozone, or trioxygen, is a chemical with the symbol O3. This means one molecule of ozone is made of three oxygen atoms. Ozone is rarely called trioxygen, even though this is its IUPAC systematic name.  Ozone is formed from oxygen gas (O2) by the action of ultraviolet light and also atmospheric electrical discharges. It is present in low concentrations throughout the Earth's atmosphere. In total, ozone makes up only 0.6 ppm (parts per million) of the atmosphere by volume.

Ozone is important to life on planet Earth. There is a portion of the stratosphere with a high concentration of ozone, called the ozone layer. The ozone layer filters out damaging ultraviolet radiation from the Sun, like a kind of sun screen. Without this ozone layer things would not have been able to live on the surface of our planet. The ozone layer also absorbs a lot of heat from the sun's rays.  

However, ozone is toxic to animals and plants above concentrations of about 0.1 ppm. In humans, it can cause nasal and throat irritation, and nausea. Extended exposure can cause lung oedema. 0.100 ppm is the maximum allowable limit for industrial, public, or occupied spaces in England, Japan, France, the Netherlands and Germany. The Ozone layer is in  the 10 to 50 kilometer range of the Earth's atmosphere.

The Treaty of Lahore was signed on 9 March 1846 after the First Sikh War. After the defeat of the Sikhs at the Battle of Sobraon the British were able to march into Lahore without any further battles. After the British reached the city of Lahore the treaty was signed.

The Sikhs (who had been defeated) were forced to sign the treaty with the British. As part of the treaty the Sikhs agreed to handover Kashmir and Hazara and Jalandhar Doab to the British. The treaty also resulted in the famous Koh-i-Noor diamond falling into British hands.

Gulab Singh, an Indian prince, negotiated between the British and the Sikhs over how the Sikhs would surrender. As well as handing over land to the British, the Sikhs had to allow a British Resident and a British army contingent at Lahore and troops in other cities.

Also, under the treaty, the Sikhs had to pay 1.2 million pounds to the British. As they were unable to pay Gulab Singh was able to take Kashmir from the Punjab government by paying 750,000 pounds to the East India Company. The Sikhs were also forced to give up the territory between the Satluj and the Beas rivers to the British. The Sikh army was also reduced.

The 1972–73 NHL season was the 56th season of the National Hockey League. Sixteen teams each played 78 games. For the first time since the collapse of the Western Hockey League in 1926, the National Hockey League had serious competition. A new professional hockey league, the World Hockey Association, made its season debut with 12 new teams, many of which were based in the same cities as NHL teams. Unlike the Western Hockey League, though, the new World Hockey Association would not challenge for the Stanley Cup. In response to the new league, the NHL hastily added two new teams in an unplanned expansion, the New York Islanders and Atlanta Flames, in an attempt to exclude the WHA from newly constructed arenas in those markets.

The first thing the WHA did was sign Bobby Hull, and the Chicago Black Hawks sued, claiming

a violation of the reserve clause in NHL contracts. Others soon followed Hull to the

WHA, including Bernie Parent, J.C. Tremblay, Ted Green, Gerry Cheevers and

Johnny McKenzie. In the expansion draft, the New York Islanders and Atlanta Flames made their picks and eleven Islander players skipped off to the WHA. The California Golden Seals, chafing under the unorthodox ownership of the unpopular Charlie Finley, were

also a victim of the WHA, losing eight key players.

[[Web color]]

CATEGORIES: Color, Web design

Web colors are colors used in designing webpages, and the ways for describing and listing those colours.

There are several ways to chose colors for parts of webpages. Colors may be listed as an RGB triplet (a set of three numbers) in hexadecimal format (a hex triplet). RGB triplet can make 16,777,216 different colors. Many common colors can also be chosen by their common English names. Often a color tool or other graphics software is used to create color values.

The first versions of Mosaic and Netscape Navigator used the X11 color names as the base for their color lists. This was because they both started as X Window System applications.

Each web color has its own definition, sRGB. This relates to the chromaticities of a single phosphor set, a given transfer curve, adaptive whitepoint, and viewing conditions. These have been chosen to be similar to many real-world monitors and viewing conditions. Even without color management, the colors created are fairly close to the given values. However, user agents can be different in the fidelity with which they show the colors. Better user agents use color management to create better color fidelity. This is important for Web-to-print applications.

[[OpenOffice Base]]

CATEGORIES: OpenOffice

OpenOffice Base is the database module released with OpenOffice version 2.0 and later. Currently it is based on the HSQLDB database engine written in Java.

The HSQLDB developers have suggested only 76% of the target has been met in the 1.8.0 release, which is the version that was integrated (merged) with OOo 2.0. They have been asking for contributions to complete all the feature targets, since the inner database engine is an independent project with no outside funding.

OpenOffice users, however, can choose to connect to an external full-featured SQL database such as MySQL, PostgreSQL and even Oracle through ODBC or JDBC drivers. OpenOffice Base can then act as a GUI frontend for SQL views, table design and query. In addition, OpenOffice has its own Form wizard to create dialog windows for form filling and updates.

Starting with version 2.3, Base will offer report generation based on Pentaho software.

In most instances, this sexual activity involves the man placing his penis between his partner's breasts. He then thrusts while the breasts are squeezed around the penis for more excitement. Mammary intercourse is sometimes combined with oral sex (blowjob). Sometimes mammary intercourse continues to the point of ejaculation. The semen can land on the breasts, face, or in the mouth of the partner. 

Some gay males may enjoy their partners breasts. They may engage in male-male mammary intercourse if the breasts are large enough.

Several slang terms refer to mammary intercourse. These slang terms include titfuck or titty fuck in the United States. Tit wank or French fuck are slang terms used in the United Kingdom.

[[Solar wind]]

CATEGORIES: Solar System, Astrophysics

The solar wind is a stream of charged particles from the Sun. It is made of charged protons, electrons and plasma shot out of the Sun, and creates the heliosphere. The wind is shot out at hypersonic speed, so fast that it can travel the whole length of the Solar System, nearly one light year. 

The particles are dangerous to astronauts and spacecraft. The Earth's magnetic field absorbs or soaks up a lot of the solar wind causing the aurora, the Northern lights and Southern lights.

At a distance of more than a few solar radii from the Sun, the solar wind reaches speeds of 250 to 750 kilometers per second and is supersonic.

A disturbance in the solar wind is called a solar storm. Sometimes it causes a geomagnetic storm. Such a storm in 1989 brought down the Quebec electric power grid and put the entire province in darkness. The largest recorded geomagnetic storm was in September 1–2, 1859. If we were to have another as strong as that one it might cause up to 2 trillion dollars damage.  

Solar wind also causes the tail of a comet. When the comet is close enough to the sun that the heat evaporates some of the comet's ice, the motion of the solar wind causes the resulting water vapor and space dust to stream away from the comet. Because it is blown by the solar wind, the comet's tail does not trail behind it, but always points directly away from the sun.  

The Solar Wind Composition Experiment of the Apollo program studied the atoms in the solar wind.

[[Lethal injection]]

CATEGORIES: Capital punishment, Punishments

Lethal injection is injecting a person, particularly a dangerous criminal with poison, usually a fatal dose of drugs so the person will die. This is usually done as capital punishment. It is the main way to execute prisoners in the United States. The idea of lethal injection was first suggested in New York in 1888, but Oklahoma was the first place to make a law that said it could use it in 1977. Texas was the first state to actually use lethal injection for an execution. This first happened when Charlie Brooks was executed in 1982. Thirty-four US states now use it for capital punishment. Other countries to use it are China, Taiwan, and Guatemala.

Lethal injection is usually done by using three chemicals. The chemicals are usually sodium thiopental (an anesthetic), pancuronium bromide (used to paralyze the person being injected), and potassium chloride (to stop the heart so that the person being injected dies). In the United States, a chemical shortage has made some states have to wait to inject criminals. Other states have changed what chemicals they use.

[[Cimabue]]

CATEGORIES: 1240 births, 1302 deaths, 13th century Italian painters

Cimabue, (c.1240 - c.1302), was a painter from Florence in Italy who worked in the Late Medieval period. His real name was Cenni di Peppi. He painted large icons in the Byzantine style and was the first great painter in the city of Florence. The only works of art that are known to be definitely by Cimabue are the mosaic of Christ in Majesty in Pisa Cathedral and two very large ruined frescos in the Church of St Francis in Assisi.

The most famous painting that is believed to be by Cimabue is the "Madonna of Santa Trinita" which is an altarpiece that was done for the Church of the Holy Trinity. It is now in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence. He is also believed to have painted two large crucifixes which hung in the Church of St Domenic in Arezzo and the Church of the Holy Cross (Santa Croce, Florence). The crucifix of Santa Croce was ruined in a flood and is now in the church's museum.

The biographer Giorgio Vasari wrote about Cimabue's life, 250 years after his death. He wrote that one day Cimabue was walking in the country when he saw a little shepherd boy scratching a picture of a sheep onto a rock. The drawing was so good that Cimabue went to the boy's father and begged that he might take the boy as his apprentice and teach him to paint. The boy was Giotto, who became a very famous painter, and who is thought of as the very first painter of the Italian Renaissance.

[[Pietro Cavallini]]

CATEGORIES: 1250 births, 1330 deaths, 13th century Italian painters, 14th century Italian painters

Pietro Cavallini, (c.1250 – c.1330) was a painter who lived and worked in Rome in Italy in the Late Medieval period. He may have also worked in Naples. He is thought of as one of the greatest painters of his day, but has never been as well known as Giotto from Florence, who was alive at the same time. This is probably because only two pictures by Cavallini still exist. One of them is a mosaic in the Church of Santa Maria in Trastevere. The other is a fresco in the nearby convent of Santa Cecilia in Trastevere. ("in Trastevere" means "in the part of the Rome that is across the Tiber River".)

The fresco at Santa Cecilia's is a large picture of the Last Judgement with Jesus sitting between rows of saints. (see right) Unfortunately, the room, which was quite tall, had a new level added, and the floor cut across the fresco. It is in ruins, but the parts that remain show that Cavallini was trying to make the figures that he painted look solid and three-dimensional like the frescos of Ancient Rome. Pietro Cavallini probably influenced the artists who travelled from Rome to work at the Basilica of St Francis of Assisi. It is not known if he painted any of the frescos there.

A multitrack master is an original multitrack recording, which may be worked on over time. This may have four, eight, sixteen or more tracks. This kind of recording cannot be played on an ordinary machine, and needs a special machine to be played or recorded.

Multitrack recordings are mixed when they are finished, into a mono (monaural), stereo, or Surround Sound recording. This is called a mixed master. Copies of the mixed master can be played on an ordinary machine.

Master recordings are often valuable, especially if the recording artist is popular. Most masters are owned by record companies, but many artists and bands own their own master recordings, or are able to buy them later.

Recordings are sometimes remastered, to copy them to another format, or to make them sound better. Digital recording allows for older analog recordings to be "cleaned up", and preserved.

[[Great Pyramid of Giza]]

CATEGORIES: Ancient Egypt, Pyramids, Buildings and structures in Egypt, Archaeological sites in Egypt, Giza

The Great Pyramid of Giza is a huge pyramid built by the Ancient Egyptians. It stands 18.4 km from Cairo, Egypt. It is the oldest of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, and the only one to remain mostly intact. When it was built it was 146.5 metres (481 feet) tall. It was the tallest building in the world for over 3,800 years.  Erosion and other causes have shrunk it to 138.8 m. The pyramid was probably built for Khufu, an Egyptian pharaoh. It was perhaps built by Khufu's vizier, Hemiunu. It is believed that it took about 20 years to build, and was completed around 10,000 BC.

When it was built, the Great Pyramid was covered by white stones that formed a smooth outer surface. Some of these stones  can still be seen around the base. Most of what can be seen of the pyramid now is its basic core 2,300,000 blocks of limestone and granite. There have been many different theories to explain how the pyramid was built. Most accepted building ideas are based on the idea of moving huge stones from a quarry and dragging and lifting them into place.  Archaeologists found that the Pyramids of Giza were not built by slaves, but workers who were paid for working. Their graves were found near the pyramid in 1990.

There are three known rooms, or chambers, inside the Great Pyramid. The lowest chamber is cut into the rock on which the pyramid was built. This chamber was not finished. The other two chambers are higher up inside the pyramid. They are called the Queen's Chamber and the King's Chamber, but these are modern labels as we do not know how the Egyptians were going to use them. The Great Pyramid has two passages, one leading up, and the other down. It is the only Egyptian pyramid to have the two passages.

The Great Pyramid is part of a group of buildings, called the Giza Necropolis. This includes two mortuary temples in honour of Khufu. One is close to the pyramid and one near the Nile. There are three smaller pyramids for Khufu's wives. Other buildings include an even smaller "satellite" pyramid, and a raised causeway which joins the two temples. There are other tombs, called mastaba, probably for other important people.

[[Personal space]]

CATEGORIES: Sociology

Personal space is a concept from sociology. The concept talks about two actors (two people). The basic idea behind it is these actors have space around them. The closer they are to each other emotionally, the closer an actor will be able to stand to the other, without being intrusive. The concept was introduced by Edward T. Hall in 1966.  Discomfort will result if one actor steps into the personal space of the other, without this being desired. The amount of space a being needs can be classified in two categories:

Hall's spacing models were based on Heini Hediger's 1955 psychological studies of zoo animals.

[[Pilot whale]]

CATEGORIES: Oceanic dolphins, Mammals of Asia

Pilot whales are two species of oceanic dolphins, whose scientific name is Globicephala. The two types of pilot whales are the long-finned pilot whale and the short-finned pilot whale. Their behaviour resembles that of the larger whales more than that of dolphins. 

The two look similar at sea and are usually just known simply as pilot whales or calderón in Spanish. They and other large dolphins are also known as blackfish.

Pilot whales can be found nearly worldwide. The long-finned variety prefers colder waters, for example near Antarctica. The short-finned ones can also be found in tropical waters. Pilot whales are highly social animals, they live in groups of 20-30 animals, called pods. Larger groups of over 100 pilot whales have been observed. Studies suggest that the young remain in the same pod as their parents, which is unusual for mammals. Female short-finned pilot whales go through menopause. Females that no longer reproduce contribute to the survival of the young.

For reasons which are unknown, pilot whales seem to end up stranded on a beach fairly often.

[[Flamethrower]]

CATEGORIES: Weapons

A flamethrower is a device used to shoot fire. They have been used by the military since the days of Greek fire. Most modern military flamethrowers project flaming liquids. 

Flamethrowers became rare in the 19th century, due to improvements in other weapons.  Trench warfare made them more useful again, and the German army began using them in 1915.  Flamethrowers were used during World War 2 as a bunker clearing device.  Many Axis troops used pillboxes and other small fortifications in Northern France, Germany, and on Pacific Ocean islands.  Small fire squads used these weapons to draw them out.  Although flamethrowers project flames, burning was not the most common form of death associated with these weapons.  Rather, smoke released as a byproduct of combustion presented soldiers with the grim ultimatum between death by smoke inhalation or leaving the trench and facing enemy gunfire.

Due to advancements in ballistic technologies and modern warfare tactics, flamethrowers are much less common in modern theatres. Presently, these weapons have been converted for civilian use for clearing old crops, domestic defense and even landscaping. In 2018, the Boring Company headed by Elon Musk developed a civilian flamethrower in a limited production of 20,000 units. With the prominence of Musk in contemporary culture, these flamethrowers were sold quickly yielding 10 million dollars for the Boring Company in gross revenue.

[[Poales]]

CATEGORIES: Poales

Poales is a taxonomic order of flowering plants in the monocotyledons. The order includes families of plants such as the grasses, bromeliads, and sedges.

The earliest fossils attributed to the Poales date to the late Cretaceous period about Paleogene million years ago, though some suggest the origin of the group may be 115 million years ago in South America. The earliest known fossils include pollen and fruits.

The flowers are typically small, enclosed by bracts, and arranged in inflorescences (except in the  genus Mayaca, with solitary terminal flowers). The flowers of many species are wind pollinated; the seeds usually contain starch.

One recent classification lists these families: 

[[Poaceae]]

CATEGORIES: Poaceae

Poaceae or Gramineae are the "true" grasses. They are a large family of monocot flowering plants. There are about 12,000 species and 780 genera. They are one of most ecologically and economically important of all plant families. Rushes, and sedges fall outside this family, but they are related.

Grasslands are about 20% of the vegetation cover of the Earth. Poaceae also live in many other habitats, including wetlands, forests, and tundra. Bamboos are part of this huge family of plants.

Domestication of poaceous cereal crops such as maize (corn), wheat, millets, and rice are eaten around the world. The Poaceae are the most economically important plant family in modern times, providing forage, building materials (bamboo, thatch) and fuel (ethanol), as well as food.

[[Ploidy]]

CATEGORIES: Chromosomes, Plants, Cell biology

Ploidy is a term from genetics and cell biology. It is used to indicate the number of chromosome sets in a cell. Most eukaryotes have either one set (called haploid) or two sets (called diploid). Some other organisms are polyploid, they have more than two sets of chromosomes. Some amphibians are triploid, with three sets. The endosperm cells in the seeds of many plants are also triploid. Some kinds of trout or salmon have four sets (tetraploid). Other examples:

Sex cells (gametes) are almost always haploid. If the reproductive stage (adult) is polyploid, then the gametes will have half the ploidy number of chromosomes. 

There are some variations of ploidy which are not discussed here. Some plant species with certain types of polyploidy do not use sexual reproduction, but survive with asexual methods.

[[Foreplay]]

CATEGORIES: Human sexuality

Foreplay is the name for a number of things people do before they have sex. These things do not need to be directly related to having sex. Rather, they are done to sexually arouse people, to make them want each other more, Examples of things that can be used in foreplay differ among people, Most people prefer simple things that make them feel nice such as a person talking softly, a compliment, a Hug, or by being Tickled by a person they like, or even sharing similar hobbies, such as white water rafting, rocky mountain climbing or even how flexible you both are at Yoga,

Not all of these acts are physical, some can also be psychological. Common things done in foreplay include kissing, touching each other, hugging, and stimulating the others erogenous zones.

Foreplay has a well-defined function - it lowers inhibitions and makes people feel better at ease.

Foreplay has been mentioned in historic works.  The Ancient Indian work Kama Sutra mentions different types of embracing, kissing, and marking with nails and teeth. It also mentions BDSM activities such as slapping and moaning as "play."

Based on age, religious and political background, what people do as foreplay can be quite different. Many people think that women demand more foreplay and require more time to become aroused. Recent scientific research has show that this is false, though.  Scientists from McGill University Health Centre in Montreal, Canada used the method of thermal imaging to record baseline temperature change in the genital area as the definition of the time necessary for sexual arousal. Researchers studied the time required for an individual to reach the peak of sexual arousal and concluded that, on average, women and men spend almost the same time for sexual arousal — around 10 minutes.

[[Araceae]]

CATEGORIES: Araceae

Araceae are a family of monocotyledonous flowering plants in which flowers are borne on a type of inflorescence called a spadix. The spadix is usually accompanied by, and sometimes partially enclosed in, a 'spathe' or leaf-like bract. 

Also known as the Arum family, members are often colloquially known as aroid. This family of 107 genera and over 3700 species is most diverse in the New World tropics, although also distributed in the Old World tropics and north temperate regions.

These plants often have rhizomes or tubers with calcium oxalate crystals or 'raphides' and commonly with milky sap. The leaves are alternate, simple or compound, petiolate, sometimes very large, and usually with a sheathing base.

Some genera of araceae include:

[[Second Coming]]

CATEGORIES: New Testament, Christian eschatology, Eschatology, Islam

Gospel Jesus In Christianity, the Second Coming is a time when Jesus Christ will come back to earth.  The Apostles Creed and the Nicene Creed state that "Christ will come again". This coming is to judge the living and the dead.  Throughout history, there have been different ideas about the details of this event. These disagreements are related to the Millennium which is described in the Book of Revelation as a 1000 year reign of Christ on the earth. Some Christians, called Amillennialists, think the 1,000 years refers only to the eventual triumph of the Gospel. Others, called Postmillennialists think that Jesus will return physically to earth.  This will happen only after Christianity has been predominant for the 1,000 years. This may be a real 1,000 years or an indefinitely long time.  In recent times, many Christians, especially in the United States, have believed that there will be a Rapture of the Christians.  This means that at a certain time all Christians will go up to heaven to be with Jesus.  After seven years of trouble on earth, Jesus will return with all the Christians to defeat the Antichrist and rule on earth for 1,000 literal years. Others who believe in the rapture put it at in the middle or at the end of the seven years. These different views come mainly from the Book of Revelation, but other Old Testament and New Testament books are also used to develop the different views. Since the Book of Revelation uses highly symbolic language, it can be understood in different ways.  What virtually all Christians agree on is that in some way, Jesus will someday destroy all evil from the earth and bring goodness and peace.

[[Beret]]

[[Premature birth]]

CATEGORIES: Biological reproduction, Babies

Premature birth is when a baby is born before the normal end of pregnancy. In humans, a pregnancy normally lasts for about nine months. On average, a pregnancy lasts for 266 days.

Babies who are born before 37 complete weeks of pregnancy (calculated from the last menstrual period) are said to be premature. In the United States, about twelve percent of the babies are born prematurely (that is about one in every eight babies). In 2003, there were over 490,000 premature births. 

Worldwide rates of prematurity are more difficult to get. In developing countries, there is often no professional medical care for these babies. This makes it difficult to tell how far along the pregnancy really was. For this reason, the World Health Organization tracks rates of low birth weight instead. In 2000, 16.5 percent of babies born in developing countries were of low birth weight. It is estimated that one-third of these low birth weight deliveries are due to premature delivery.

[[Nicotine replacement therapy]]

CATEGORIES: Smoking, Medical procedures, Addiction

The nicotine in cigarettes and other tobacco products makes people dependent. When they quit, they will get withdrawal symptoms. Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is there to reduce the dependency symptoms. This is usually done by delivering nicotine (or a substance very similar to it) in other ways. Common methods include nicotine patches and chewing gums with nicotine in them.

Cigarettes are responsible for the deaths of about 5 million people each year. These people are not killed by the nicotine in the cigarette, but by other substances in tobacco smoke such as carbon monoxide and tars. 

NRT delivers nicotine to the smoker's brain in a much slower way than cigarettes do. It helps to damp down the urges to smoke that most smokers have in the early days and weeks after quitting, rather than remove them totally. It gives the smoker the chance to break smoking cues in their daily lives, and might provide a more comfortable exit from the smoking habit. NRT however is best used with some form of support, ideally from someone who knows something about smoking cessation.

In 2005 the Committee on the Safety of Medicines recommended that NRT be given to pregnant smokers and also to adolescent smokers.April 2009 

Findings from a recent Cochrane review of controlled trials testing NRT products (Stead et al. 2008) indicated that smokers using NRT were 1.5 to 2 times more likely to be abstinent from smoking at followup than those in the placebo or control treatment condition.

[[Metadata]]

CATEGORIES: Computer science, Data science, Photography

Metadata (also Meta data) is data about data, that is information about other information. This is often useful. Libraries usually group books by subject and keep a catalog of the books. In that context the metadata in the catalog include various pieces of information including the author and the subject it is classified under. The index and table of contents of a book also present metadata.

Digital cameras allow people to take pictures. Here the data is the picture taken, and the metadata is information about the picture taken, like when (the date and time), photographic exposure, focal length and other technical details about how the camera made the picture. Some cameras, especially smartphones, have GPS and can include the location in metadata.

[[Failure rate]]

CATEGORIES: Statistics, Engineering

Failure rate is the frequency with which an engineered system or component fails. Usually it is expressed in a number of failures per time period, like failures per hour. It is often written as the Greek letter λ (lambda) and is important in reliability theory. In practice, the closely related Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) is more commonly expressed and used for high quality components or systems.

Failure rate is usually time dependent, and an intuitive corollary is that the rate changes over time versus the expected life cycle of a system.  For example, as an automobile grows older, the failure rate in its fifth year of service may be many times greater than its failure rate during its first year of service–one simply does not expect to replace an exhaust pipe, overhaul the brakes, or have major transmission problems in a new vehicle.  

Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) is closely related to failure rate.  In the special case when the likelihood of failure remains constant with respect to time (for example, in some product like a brick or protected steel beam), and ignoring the time to recover from failure, failure rate is simply the inverse of the Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF).  MTBF is an important specification parameter in all aspects of high importance engineering design–such as naval architecture, aerospace engineering, automotive design, etc.–in short, any task where failure in a key part or of the whole of a system needs be minimized and severely curtailed, particularly where lives might be lost if such factors are not taken into account. These factors account for many safety and maintenance practices in engineering and  industry practices and government regulations, such as how often certain inspections and overhauls are required on an aircraft.

A similar ratio used in the transport industries, especially in railways and trucking is Mean Distance Between Failure, a variation which attempts to correlate actual loaded distances to similar reliability needs and practices.

Failure rates are important factors in insurance, business, and regulation practices as well as fundamental to design of safe systems throughout a national or international economy.

[[Reed–Solomon error correction]]

CATEGORIES: Computer science, Mathematics

Reed-Solomon error correction is a forward error correction code. It works by  oversampling a polynomial constructed from the data. The polynomial is evaluated at several points, and these values are sent or recorded. Sampling the polynomial more often than is necessary makes the polynomial over-determined. As long as it receives "many" of the points correctly, the receiver can recover the original polynomial even in the presence of a "few" bad points. 

Reed-Solomon codes are used in many different kinds of commercial applications, for example in CDs, DVDs and Blu-ray Discs, in data transmission technologies such as DSL & WiMAX, and broadcast systems such as DVB and ATSC.

[[Shepherds Flat Wind Farm]]

CATEGORIES: Wind farms, Buildings and structures in Oregon

Approval has been given for the 303 turbine Shepherds Flat Wind Farm near Arlington, Oregon.  The wind farm will be able to generate 909 megawatts (MW) at its peak, which is enough electricity to power some 225,000 homes.  The wind farm should employ up to 300 people during construction and about 25 when operational.

When completed, this will be the world's largest wind farm.  Currently, the largest operating wind farm in the U.S. is the 736 MW Horse Hollow Wind Energy Center in Texas. Billionaire oilman T. Boone Pickens plans to build a 4,000 MW Pampa Wind Project by 2014, also in Texas.

[[Pampa Wind Project]]

CATEGORIES: Wind farms, Texas

T. Boone Pickens, a former Texas oilman, is planning to build the world's largest wind farm, called the Pampa Wind Project, as part of the Pickens Plan. It will be developed by Pickens' company, Mesa Power. The proposed 4,000 MW facility will be located near Pampa, Texas, which is on the Texas Panhandle, and will stretch to the east, spanning 400,000 acres in five counties. This will provide enough power for 1.5 million average homes.

When it was planned, it would have been the largest wind farm in the United States. As of May 2008, the largest U.S. wind plant is the Horse Hollow Wind Energy Center with a capacity of 736 MW.

Electric transmission lines must connect wind farms to the places where the electricity is used. People fought over whether wind farm owners or electricity users should pay to build these lines. On July 17, 2008, the Texas Public Utilities Commission ruled that ratepayers should pay $4.93 billion to build the lines to connect wind farms in the Texas Panhandle to the Texas electric grid. This implements a 2005 Texas law designed to promote new wind energy projects.

On March 2, 2009, Mesa Power announced that it was working on the first phase of the project. But had put off work on the later phases. It canceled 120 of 197 wind leases. 

In July 2009, Mesa Power delayed (but did not cancel) the project. Mesa Power said the project must wait because it did not have transmission capacity to the site and poor credit market. Mesa Power will restart the Pampa Wind Farm project in 2013, when transmission lines are due to be completed in the area.  In the meantime, Mesa Power will use the 667 turbines it purchased to build several smaller wind farms.

[[Cluster headache]]

CATEGORIES: Diseases

Cluster headaches are a type of headache.  They are the least common type of headache. 

Cluster headaches are very painful.  They usually cause very strong pain on one side of the head, behind the eye and temple.  The headaches can last anywhere from 15–180 minutes.  People with severe cases may have cluster headaches many times a day.  

Cluster headaches may also cause other symptoms.  Most people get restless or agitated during an attack.  Some people get a runny or stuffy nose.  The eye on the side of the head that hurts can also get red or start tearing up. 

They are called "cluster headaches" because they usually come and go.  For a while, person may have many attacks of cluster headaches.  Sometimes, they may then have no cluster headaches for a while.  If a person has no cluster headaches for a while, this is called a remission period.  No one knows why remission periods happen.  Some people with cluster headaches never have a remission period. 

Cluster headaches can be genetic (passed down through families).  However, when they are, a person may never have a cluster headache unless they have a bad head injury. 

In people who do not carry a gene for cluster headaches, nobody knows what causes them.  

[[Ultimate (sport)]]

CATEGORIES: Team sports, Sports in the United States

Ultimate (often called Ultimate Frisbee in reference to the trademarked brand name) is a team sport played with a 175 gram flying disc. Opposing teams of 7 players try to move the disc into the opponent's end zone by throwing the disc to each other. The governing body controls the rules of play such as fouls, infractions, and time constraints for play. The sport is played at all levels from pickup games and middle schools to the elite teams that compete at the national and international levels. Some useful player abilities include speed, leaping ability, good throwing and catching skills, and good defensive play.  There is no official officiating for Ultimate.  Players are set to make their own calls and partake in conflict resolution.

A point is scored when one team catches the disc in the other team's end zone. The disc can only be moved by passing, but the player with the disc can pivot on one foot.

If a pass is incomplete (touches the ground or is caught or knocked down by a defending player) or out of bounds, it is a "turnover" and the other team gets possession of the disc.

Van Diemen had sent Tasman to explore the extent of the presumed south land  in 1642.

In 1803, the island was settled by the British as a penal colony. It was called Van Diemen's Land, and became part of the British colony of New South Wales. In 1824, Van Diemen's Land became an independent colony with George Arthur as the first Governor. 

In 1856 Britain changed the name to Tasmania, an alternative name that had been shown on some maps and used by the community for decades. It was formally changed  at the request of its citizens. Britain also gave the colony the right to govern itself later that year. It had its own parliament.

Serbia refused to accept one of the ten items of the ultimatum, and so Austria-Hungary mobilized their army. This, along with a chain of Alliances in Europe (Triple Entente and Central Powers) helped cause World War I.

Starting in the town of Gothenburg in Sweden it is sometimes referred to as the "Gothenburg Sound" 

Melodic death metal started in Scandinavia, in countries such as Sweden and Norway. Many early melodic death metal bands wanted to mix the fast, brutal songs of death metal with the dual guitar harmonies and melodies of heavy metal bands such as Iron Maiden and Saxon.

Famous melodic death metal bands include In Flames, a Swedish band formed by Jesper Strombald, and Dark Tranquillity, one of the oldest and highly listened to bands in the genre.

[[Sirius Black]]

CATEGORIES: Fictional characters introduced in 1999, Harry Potter characters

Sirius Black is a fictional character in J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter series, played by Gary Oldman.  Black, also known as Padfoot or Snuffles (in his Animagus form) was a pure-blood wizard. He was born on 3rd November, 1959 and is the eldest son of Orion and Walburga Black. He is heir of the Ancient and Noble house of Black and brother to Regulus. His cousin's are Bellatrix Lestrange (née Black), Andromeda Tonks (née Black) and Narcissa Malfoy (née Black). He was Harry Potter's godfather. He was best friends with James Potter, along with Remus Lupin and Peter Pettigrew. These four were known as the Marauders in their school days, and created the Marauder's Map.

He, along with his three friends, belonged to Gryffindor house when at Hogwarts, unlike the rest of his family, who had belonged to the house of Slytherin. He did not like his family, and ran away from home to James Potter's house when he was 16. The Potters took Sirius in as their own son. His prized possession during childhood was his flying motorbike.

Sirius was an animagus and was able to transform into a big black dog, (a Grim) which is an omen of death, at will. He, along with James Potter and Peter Pettigrew became Animagus to help Remus Lupin with his transformations. He was the first wizard to escape Azkaban prison, after being kept there twelve years for a crime that he did not commit. The betrayal of James and Lily Potter, the murder of Peter Pettigrew and 12 muggles with an unknown curse. Harry found out, after a year of believing otherwise, that Sirius was an innocent man, and helped him evade capture from the Ministry of Magic. Sirius went on the run before returning to his (empty) childhood home, 12 Grimmauld Place, and offered it up as headquarters for the Order of the Phoenix upon Voldemort's return. He was killed in a battle at the Ministry of Magic by his cousin, a Death Eater, Bellatrix Lestrange in Harry's (his Godson's)5th year at Hogwarts. He returned during Harry's 7th year along with James, Lily and Remus, after being resurrected with the help of the Resurrection stone in a hazy form.

He was the only remaining “true” heir of the House of Black. 12 Grimmauld Place was gifted to Harry Potter, Sirius’ godson. In which case, Harry or Draco Malfoy (related to the House of Black through his mother Narcissa) would’ve likely inherited the title of Head of House. Possibly even Andromeda Tonks or her grandson, Edward “Teddy” Remus Lupin.

As he has said before, "almost all pure-bloods are somehow related, and he’s no exception". He’s related to the Weasleys by way of Cedrella Weasley (née Black), whom married Septimus Weasley. Together they're the paternal grandparents of the Weasley children. He’s related to the Malfoys through Narcissa Malfoy (née Black) who married into the Malfoy family, and is Sirius’ cousin. He’s even related to his godson, Harry Potter, through Dorea Potter (née Black) who is a distant relative to Harry and James Potter.

[[Worcestershire sauce]]

CATEGORIES: Sauces

Worcestershire sauce (spoken likeˈwʊstəˌʃɪə or WUSS-ter-SHERR) is a widely-usedused fermented sauce. It was first made at 68 Broad Street, Worcester, by the company Lea & Perrins in the 1830s.  It was made for selling to people in 1837, and is still the only Worcestershire sauce still to be made in the UK.  In 1930 the company was sold to HP Foods and was later sold to the H.J. Heinz Company from Groupe Danone in 2005.

The sauce is made ready to sell in the Midlands Road factory in Worcester, which is the home of Lea & Perrins since 16 October 1897.

The H. J. Heinz Company, which now makes "The Original Lea & Perrins Worcestershire Sauce", with the name Lea & Perrins, Inc., lists these ingredients on the bottle made in the United States: vinegar, molasses, high fructose corn syrup, anchovies, water, onions, salt, garlic, tamarind concentrate, cloves, natural flavorings and chili pepper extract.

The sauce is used to make many dishes, both cooked and uncooked, and often with beef; drinks such as the Bloody Mary also use it. Lea & Perrins also makes it in concentrated form that is made ready to sell in other countries.

Worcestershire sauce is called Worcester sauce in South Africa and some parts of the US as; (ˈwʊstə), or spoken like Woo-ster sauce.

The "Worcestershire sauce" is one of many food products that were made because of Britain ruling India.

[[Fluxbox]]

CATEGORIES: Desktop Environments

In Unix computing, Fluxbox is an X window manager based on Blackbox 0.61.1. It tries to be lightweight and customizable, and has very little support for graphical icons. Its user interface has only a taskbar and a menu that can be used by right-clicking on the desktop. All basic settings are controlled by text files.

Fluxbox can show some eye candy such as: colors, gradients, borders, and several other basic appearance settings can be changed. Effects managers such as Xcompmgr and transset-df can add true transparency to desktop elements and windows. Enhancements can also be provided by using iDesk or fbdesk, or the ROX Desktop.

Fluxbox also has several features Blackbox does not have, including tabbed windows and a configurable titlebar.

Because of its small memory use and quick loading time, Fluxbox is popular in many Live CDs such as Knoppix STD and GParted. It was the default window manager of Damn Small Linux, but was replaced with JWM after the release of Damn Small Linux 4.0.  It is currently the default window manager of antiX https://web.archive.org/web/20090430165804/http://antix.mepis.com/index.php/Main_Page, a linux distribution based on MEPIS and designed for old computers, PCFluxboxOS, a remaster of PCLinuxOS, and LinguasOS, a Live CD distribution for professional translators.

Despite the child-like form of the series and having cute characters, the show is deadly violent and not for kids and is only for 14+ content.

While the music videos are comparable to that of Nirvana (the short cartoon featured on Smells Like Teen Spirit), the industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails, the band The Police and the movie studio Universal Pictures, the portrayal of death in Happy Tree Friends is usually more extreme sport stunts and anatomically correct, showing rain and special effects in more vivid and often exaggerated detail.

Though it is easy to tell what each character's reaction is, their words can hardly be understood at all. According to the website, the idea for Happy Tree Friends was created by Rhode Montijo when he drew a yellow rabbit, slightly resembling the character Cuddles, on a piece of paper and wrote "Resistance Is Futile" underneath it, because must include grunge bands Nirvana, Soundgarden, Alice in Chains and Pearl Jam in Seattle with Universal Music Group.

Louis Pierre Althusser (Pronunciation: altuˡseʁ) (October 16, 1918 – October 22, 1990) was a Marxist philosopher. He was born in Algeria and studied at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris. Then, he became Professor of Philosophy there. He also was a teacher of Michel Foucault and Jacques Derrida.

Althusser was a lifelong member of the French Communist Party. Sometimes he criticised the party strongly. His arguments and theses were set against the threats that he saw attacking the theoretical foundations of Marxism. These included both the influence of empiricism on Marxist theory, and humanist and reformist socialist orientations which could be seen as divisions in the European Communist Parties, as well as the problem of the 'cult of personality' and of ideology itself. 

Althusser is commonly referred to as a Structural Marxist, although his relationship to other schools of French structuralism is not a simple affiliation and he is critical of many aspects of structuralism.

[[Nude photography]]

CATEGORIES: Photography, Nudity

Nude photography is a style of photography which shows the naked human body as a form of art. This is different form erotic photography, and pornography which focus on sexual arousal. 

For many photographers, nude photography is a study of the human body, much like some paintings did.

Photographing a named person is called portraiture. Nude photography focuses on showing the human body, and often the face is not visible.

In general, nude photography is a planned image, not a snapshot. Nude photography wants to show a stylised depiction of the human body. Photographers sometimes use extremes of light and shadow, oiled skin, and shadows falling across the body to show the texture and structure of the body.

Early photographers often showed the nudity of women like the one we see here by Félix-Jacques Moulin. Many, like Edward Weston, Jean-Christophe Destailleur,  Augustao de Luca, Ruth Bernhard and Jerry Avenaim, preferred to show the lines of a body as a piece of art. They used the terms art nude and figurenude from painting  to avoid suggestions that their works were meant to be erotica or pornography.

[[Erotic photography]]

CATEGORIES: Photography

Erotic photography is a style of photography, between nude photography and pornography.  Erotic photography  wants to show the more or less naked human body in a sexual context.  It can be difficult to make a difference between erotic photography and pornography - in general erotic photography wants to arouse or stimulate the viewer.

This stimulation is generally not done by explicitly showing people having sex.  Instead, the models in the photographs will try to create a sexual impression. For example, female models may try to appear alluring.  Male models will try to convey sexual arousal, though not through a full erection.  In general, erotic photography only suggests, and has a higher artistic value than pornography.

[[Interference]]

CATEGORIES: Wave physics

In physics, interference is the effect of wave functions. A single wave can interfere with itself, but this is still an addition of two waves (see Young's slits experiment). Two waves always interfere, even if the result of the addition is complicated or not remarkable.

Something that happens when two or more waves are in the same space. Sometimes the peak of one wave joins with the peak of another wave, so the resulting peak is twice as high. Sometimes the peak of one wave falls into the trough of another wave, and the surface is then flat. When waves add their effects, it is called positive interference, or constructive interference. When one wave subtracts from the effects of the other, it is called negative interference, or destructive interference.

If two people pushed on a car in the same direction, they would move the car better than either one alone. That would be positive interference.  If two people of equal strength pushed the car from opposite directions, then it would not be moved by either of them. That would be negative interference.

[[Tiktaalik]]

CATEGORIES: Fossils, Extinct fish, Lobe-finned fish

Italic title

Tiktaalik is a genus of extinct fish. This sarcopterygian (lobe-finned) fish from the later Devonian has many features similar to those of tetrapods (four-legged animals).

Tiktaalik lived about 375 million years ago. It is part of the transition between fish such as Panderichthys, known from fossils 380 million years old, and early tetrapods such as Acanthostega and Ichthyostega, known from fossils about 365 million years old. Its mixture of basal fish and derived tetrapod characteristics led one of its discoverers, Neil Shubin, to call Tiktaalik a 'fishapod'.

This, and other species like it, prove that legs started to develop before these animals were land-based. They were shallow-water carnivorous fish, or fishapods. Tiktaalik was therefore a transitional fossil, and an example of mosaic evolution.

[[Image:Fishapods.png|thumb|center|350px|In the late Devonian, descendants of pelagic lobe-finned fish – like Eusthenopteron – showed a sequence of adaptations:

Panderichthys, suited to muddy shallows;

Tiktaalik with limb-like fins that could take it onto land;

Descendants also included pelagic lobe-finned coelacanth species.]]

[[Game (food)]]

[[Oregon Trail]]

CATEGORIES: 19th century in the United States, Migration, National Historic Landmarks of the United States, Trails, Oregon Trail

People traveled on the Oregon Trail in wagons in order to settle new parts of the United States of America during the 19th century. The Oregon Trail started in Missouri near the area where Kansas City, Missouri is today and ended in the Willamette Valley in Oregon.  The Trail was about 2,170 miles (3,500 km) long, and could take up to six months to travel.

People went to Oregon for many reasons. Some people wanted land. Some thought Oregon would be a better place to live. Most of them went because they wanted a new life.

The Oregon Trail was first traveled around 1841. Once a railroad was built across the United States in 1869, people could take trains to the western United States, so fewer people began to travel west in wagons.  By that time, about 400,000 people had crossed the Oregon Trail in wagons.  However, some people kept traveling the Trail until the 1880s.

[[Emancipation Proclamation]]

CATEGORIES: African-American history, American Civil War, Slavery

The Emancipation Proclamation was an order by U.S. President Abraham Lincoln to free slaves in 10 states.  It applied to slaves in the states still in rebellion in 1863 during the American Civil War. It did not actually immediately free all slaves in those states, because those areas were still controlled by the Confederacy. It did, however, free at least 20,000 slaves immediately, and nearly all 4 million slaves (according to the 1860 United States census) as the Union army advanced into Confederate states. Until the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1865, only the states had power to end slavery within their own borders. Thus, Lincoln issued the Proclamation as a war measure in his role as commander-in-chief. 

The Proclamation made emancipation a goal of the Civil War. It also weakened efforts within England and France to officially recognize the Confederacy. As Union troops advanced into Rebel (Confederate) territory, they freed thousands of slaves per day. Many did not wait, but fled their owners to claim their freedom. 

Five slave states (the Border States) had remained loyal to the Union and were not at war with the federal government. Thus, Lincoln did not have authority to free slaves in those states, and so this Proclamation was not applied in those states. The Proclamation also did not apply to Tennessee, nor to areas within Virginia and Louisiana which Union forces already controlled.

[[Shelf life]]

CATEGORIES: Food and drink

Shelf life is length of time that food can be stored safely.  Food cannot be kept forever. After a certain time it will go bad.  After this time it is no longer safe to eat it.  Shelf life is also used for drugs, drinks and other things that can go bad.

In some countries, a best before, use by or freshness date must be put on packaged foods.

During this time, if the food is kept under proper conditions the quality of the food does not change.  Frozen food that does not remain frozen will go bad earlier, for example.  Most of these labels do not guarantee the safety of food.  They should only be used as a guide.

The Red Army Faction or RAF (German Rote Armee Fraktion), was one of postwar West Germany's most active and prominent militant left-wing groups. 

It described itself as a communist "urban guerrilla" group engaged in armed resistance, while it was described by the West German government as a terrorist group.

The RAF was formally founded in 1970 by Andreas Baader, Gudrun Ensslin, Horst Mahler, Ulrike Meinhof, Irmgard Möller and others.

The Red Army Faction operated from the 1970s to 1993, committing numerous crimes, especially in the autumn of 1977, which led to a national crisis that became known as "German Autumn".

It was responsible for 34 deaths including many secondary targets such as chauffeurs and bodyguards—and many injuries in its almost 30 years of existence. It ceased activities in 1993 and disbanded in 1998.

[[Large Hadron Collider]]

CATEGORIES: Buildings and structures in Switzerland, Nuclear physics

The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is the world's biggest and most powerful particle accelerator. It was built by the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). It is a giant circular tunnel built underground. The tunnel is 17 miles (27 kilometers) long, and between 50 and 175 meters below the ground. It lies beneath the border of Switzerland and France. 10,000 scientists and engineers from over 100 different countries worked together in the making of this project, and it cost 10.4 billion Swiss francs ($10 billion) to build. It is now the largest and most complicated experimental research facility in the world. 

As its name states, the research at the LHC involves the collision of hadrons. A hadron is a particle which consists of a number of quarks held together by the subatomic strong force. Protons and neutrons are examples of a hadron. The LHC primarily uses the collision of protons in its experiments. Protons are parts of atoms with a positive charge. The LHC accelerates these protons through the tunnel until they reach nearly the speed of light.  Different protons are directed through the tunnel in opposite directions. When they collide, they create conditions similar to the early universe. 

The LHC attempts to study elementary particles and the ways they interact. Researchers have used it to learn about quantum physics, and they hope to learn much more about the structure of space and time. The observations researchers are able to make can help us learn what the universe might have been like within milliseconds after the big bang.

[[Predictive Failure Analysis]]

CATEGORIES: Computer science

Predicive failure analysis is a technology developed by IBM to monitor the likelihood of a hard disk failure. Today, it is part of S.M.A.R.T.

[[Parallel ATA]]

CATEGORIES: Computer hardware, Computer buses

Parallel ATA is a way to connect storage devices, such as Hard disks, solid-state drives, and CD-ROM drives inside personal computers. The standard is maintained by X3/INCITS committee T13. 

It used to be called Advanced Technology Attachment with Packet Interface (ATA/ATAPI). ATA/ATAPI is the result of a long history of development. It is an evolution of the AT Attachment Interface, which was itself evolved in several stages from Western Digital's original Integrated Drive Electronics interface. As a result, many near-synonyms for ATA/ATAPI and its previous incarnations exist, including abbreviations such as IDE which are still in common informal use. With the market introduction of Serial ATA in 2003, the original ATA was retroactively renamed Parallel ATA (PATA).

Parallel ATA standards allow cable lengths up to only 18 inches (46 centimeters). Because of this length limit the technology normally appears as an internal computer storage interface. 

For many years ATA provided the most common and the least expensive interface for this application. 

As of 2007, it has largely been replaced by Serial ATA (SATA) in new systems.

[[Serial Attached SCSI]]

CATEGORIES: Storage devices

Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) is a technology  designed to move data to and from computer storage devices such as hard drives and tape drives. It is a point-to-point serial protocol that replaces the parallel SCSI. SCSI  first appeared in the mid 1980s in corporate data centers. SAS  uses the standard SCSI command set. At present it is slightly slower than the final parallel SCSI implementation, but in 2009 it will double its present speed to 6 Gbit/s. This will permit much higher speed data transfers. The protocol is "downwards"-compatible with second generation SATA drives. These drives may be connected to SAS backplanes (controllers), but SAS drives can not be connected to SATA backplanes.   

The SAS protocol is developed and maintained by the T10 technical committee of the International Committee for Information Technology Standards (INCITS) and promoted by the SCSI Trade Association (SCSITA).

[[Tagged Command Queuing]]

CATEGORIES: Computer science

Tagged Command Queueing (TCQ) is a technology that allows to send multiple read and write requests to a hard drive simultaneously.  ATA TCQ is not identical in function to the more efficient Native Command Queuing (NCQ) used by SATA drives. SCSI TCQ does not suffer from the same limitations as ATA TCQ.

Before TCQ, an operating system was only able to send one request at a time.  In order to boost performance, it had to decide the order of the requests based on its own, possibly incorrect, idea of what the hard drive was doing. With TCQ, the drive can make its own decisions about how to order the requests (and in turn relieve the operating system from having to do so). The result is that TCQ can improve the overall performance of a hard drive if it is implemented correctly.

[[Native Command Queuing]]

CATEGORIES: Storage devices

Native Command Queuing (NCQ) is a technology designed to increase performance of SATA hard disks on computers. It can do this under certain situations by allowing the individual hard disk to internally optimize the order in which it executes the read and write requests it received. This can reduce the amount of unnecessary drive head movement and resulting in better performance (and slightly decreased wear of the drive) for workloads where multiple read/write requests are outstanding at the same time. This situation most often occurs in server-type applications. However, the current (as of 2004) technology actually slows down HD access in certain applications, like games and sequential reads and writes, because of the added latency induced by NCQ logic.

Native Command Queuing was preceded by Parallel ATA's version of Tagged Command Queuing (TCQ). ATA's attempt at integrating TCQ was constrained by the requirement that ATA host bus adapters use ISA bus device protocols to interact with the operating system. The resulting high CPU overhead and negligible performance gain contributed to a lack of market acceptance for TCQ. 

NCQ differs from PATA TCQ in that the command re-ordering is performed by the drive rather than the operating system, and each command is equal in importance. This is preferable since the drive has the most knowledge of its performance characteristics, and is able to take rotational position into account. NCQ and PATA TCQ have a maximum queue length of 32 in-flight commands (31 in practice), while SCSI TCQ has a maximum queue length of 264 in-flight commands.

For NCQ to be enabled, it must be supported and enabled in the SATA host bus adapter and in the hard drive itself. The appropriate device driver must be loaded into the operating system to enable NCQ on the host bus adapter. Many newer chipsets support the Advanced Host Controller Interface (AHCI), which should allow a generic driver supplied by the operating system to control them and enable NCQ. In fact, newer mainstream Linux kernels support AHCI natively. Unfortunately, Windows XP requires the installation of a vendor-specific driver even if AHCI is present on the host bus adapter. Windows Vista corrects this situation by including a generic AHCI driver.

[[Serial Storage Architecture]]

CATEGORIES: Storage devices

Serial Storage Architecture is a technology used to attach hard disks to Servers. It was developed by IBM in the 1990s. IBM produced a number of drives with this standard, but today, it has been largely replaced by the Fibre Channel architecture.

[[Fibre Channel]]

CATEGORIES: Computer science

Fibre Channel, or FC is an architecture (and a set of protocols to attach disk drives to computers, like in a Storage Area Network. Networks today are done with 4 GBit/s and 8 GBit/s over fiberglass cables. This is enough to support data transfer rates of up to 800 MBit/s. Fibrechannel permits connecting the same disk subsystem to several computers.

Basically, there are two topologies (ways to do this):

CATEGORIES: Iridaceae, Spices

Saffron (ˈsæfrən/, /ˈsæfrɒn) (Persian: زَعْفَرَان) is a spice made from the stigma of the flower of the saffron plant. The spice is used in cooking as a seasoning and as a food colouring. It is native to Southwest Asia. It is the world's most costly spice, and has been for a long time.

Saffron has a bitter taste and smells like hay. This smell is caused by the chemicals picrocrocin and safranal. Saffron also contains a dye, crocin, that gives food a rich golden colour. Saffron is a part of many foods from around the world, and is also used in medicine.

The word saffron comes from the 12th century Old French word safran, which comes from the Latin word safranum. Safranum is also related to the Italian zafferano and Spanish azafrán. Safranum comes from the Arabic word ar (ar), which means "yellow".

[[Virgin birth of Jesus]]

CATEGORIES: Christian theology, Mary (mother of Jesus), Jesus Christ

The virgin birth of Jesus is a belief held by Christians and Muslims.  It says that Mary, Jesus' mother, was a virgin even after she became pregnant with Jesus. By the 2nd century, most people in the Christian church believed this.  The idea of the virgin birth was included in the two most common Christian creeds, the Nicene Creed and the Apostles' Creed.  The Nicene Creed says that Jesus "was incarnate of the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary" (meaning that Jesus was God in human form, and was born to the Virgin Mary).  The Apostles' Creed also says that Jesus was "born of the Virgin Mary."  The belief was not challenged, except by some sects which were not very important, before the Enlightenment theology of the eighteenth century.

The Gospels of Matthew and Luke say that Mary was a virgin and that Jesus was created by the Holy Spirit.  These Gospels started the belief that Jesus' creation was a miracle.  This belief, which is now common in Christianity, says that Jesus had no natural father; no sexual intercourse and no male seed was involved in creating him. The Gospel of Matthew also says that the virgin birth of Jesus fulfills a prophecy from the Book of Isaiah.

Since the second century, the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church have taught that Mary gave birth as a virgin (meaning she stayed a virgo intacta - an "intact virgin" - even after giving birth).

The virgin birth of Jesus is also part of Islam. The Qur'an often describes Jesus as "Jesus, son of Mary" (Isa bin Maryam).

The road goes from Interstate 90 and U.S. Route 97 in Ellensburg, Washington southeast through Yakima, Washington, the Tri-Cities of Washington, and Umatilla, Oregon before ending at Interstate 84 in Hermiston, Oregon.

Since I-82 is north of Interstate 84, it breaks the rules for Interstate numbering. This happened because when Interstate 80N was renumbered to Interstate 84 in 1980, Interstate 82 became north of Interstate 84. The renumbering was part of a project to remove Interstates that have letters within their numbers.

The highway goes over Selah Creek on a bridge called the Fred G. Redmon Bridge.  When this bridge was opened on November 2, 1971 it was the longest concrete arch bridge in North America. The bridge is 549 feet long when it goes above the creek. It is mostly north south despite ending in a 2

People have freedom to make changed versions of the content, give changed and not changed versions of the content to others, and sell copies of the content and changed versions of it.  The author of free content does not use all of his copyright monopoly, he gives many of the rights to others.  The articles in Wikipedia are free content.

Free software is different from free music or text, because it is often much more difficult to understand and change a program if one does not have its source code, than it is to change a song or a text. Because of that, the source code of free software must always be easy to receive, or the software will not be free. However, source code for pictures, movies and music can also exist and be given to others. Choosing what to call a “source code” is sometimes important when publishing a work under a copyleft license.

[[Materpiscis]]

CATEGORIES: Fossils, Extinct fish, Devonian, Western Australia

Materpiscis (Latin for "mother fish") is a genus of pyctodontid placoderm from the late Devonian period, about 380 million years ago. A fossil of this armored placoderm shows an embryo and umbilical cord inside its body. So Materpiscis is the oldest known vertebrate to show viviparity (giving birth to live young). Viviparity of one kind or another is quite common in certain kinds of fish, for example sharks.

The holotype was found in the Kimberley area of northern Western Australia. Fossils from the Gogo Formation are preserved in limestone nodules, so dilute acetic acid is used to dissolve the surrounding limestone and reveal the fossil. These fossils are often preserved in three dimensions with minimal distortion.

The species was named Materpiscis attenboroughi in honour of David Attenborough who first drew attention to the significance of the Gogo fish sites in his 1979 series Life on Earth.

Diprotodon looked like a rhino without a horn. Its feet turned inwards like a wombat’s, giving it a pigeon-toed appearance. It had strong claws on the front feet, so it may have been able to dig up roots to eat. Footprints of its hairy feet have been found, so we know it had fur like a horse rather than being bald like a rhino. Diprotodon is found in sites all over Australia, but not in Tasmania. 

Female skeletons have been found with babies located where the mother's pouch would have been. The largest specimens were hippopotamus-sized: about 3 from nose to tail, standing 2 tall at the shoulder and weighing about 2790.

[[Russo-Japanese War]]

CATEGORIES: Wars involving Russia, Wars involving Japan

The Russo-Japanese War was a war between the Japanese Empire and the Russian Empire. It started in 1904 and ended in 1905. The Japanese won the war, and the Russians lost.

The war happened because the Russian Empire and Japanese Empire disagreed over who should get parts of Manchuria and Korea. It was fought mostly on the Liaodong Peninsula and Mukden, the seas around Korea, Japan, and the Yellow Sea. The politics of the two countries in the war were very complicated, but both wanted to gain land and economic benefits.

The Chinese Empire of the Qing Dynasty was large but weak, and it was Qing land and possessions they fought over. For example Korea was under Qing rule, but was seized by Japan. The Russians wanted a 'warm-water port' on the Pacific Ocean for their navy and trade. The harbour at Vladivostok freezes over in the winter, but Port Arthur (now called the Liaodong Peninsula in China) can be used all the time. Russia had already rented the port from the Qing and had got their permission to build a Trans-Siberian railway from St Petersburg to Port Arthur.

WikiLeaks is a non-profit organization which uses its website to publish governmental, private data, corporate or religious documents that had previously been secret. The website was started in 2006, and had over 1.2 million documents in its database by the time one year had passed.  Usually, it does not give out the names and addresses of people who post documents. The site is based in Sweden. Though its name is similar to Wikipedia, it is not related to Wikipedia or the Wikimedia Foundation. The name was chosen because WikiLeaks used a wiki model at first, where people could edit the site, but it has since changed and is no longer open for editing.

In July 2010, WikiLeaks was in the news for publishing over 76,900 documents related to the War in Afghanistan. In October that same year, WikiLeaks posted almost 400,000 documents that were about the War in Iraq.

This was the largest ever leak of documents about the US Army. It reported mainly on deaths of civilians, soldiers, and sightings of homemade bombs or armed civilians.

On 28 November WikiLeaks and five major newspapers - from Spain (El País), France (Le Monde), Germany (Der Spiegel), the United Kingdom (The Guardian), and the United States (The New York Times) - all began to publish the first 291 of 251,287 confidential diplomatic cables from 274 embassies dated from 1966–2010. WikiLeaks plans to release all of the cables in phases over several months.

This leak was widely covered by the international media, as many of the leaks contained information that affected countries other than the United States. Some leaks were published by other news organizations like Fairfax Media.  White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said that an "open and transparent government is something that the President believes is truly important. But the stealing of classified information and its dissemination is a crime".

Wikileaks posted more than 20,000 emails from the Democratic National Committee (DNC) to show they tried to undermine Bernie Sanders.

[[One Hot Minute]]

CATEGORIES: 1995 albums, Red Hot Chili Peppers albums

One Hot Minute is the sixth studio album by American alternative rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers. It was released on September 12, 1995 by record label Warner Bros. Records. John Frusciante had left the band after their previous album, Blood Sugar Sex Magik, so Dave Navarro joined as the new guitarist.

Red Hot Chili Peppers' music was very different because of Navarro. One Hot Minute is less about sex and love than the band's previous work, but is instead about themes like drugs and depression. It also had some heavy metal guitar riffs. Anthony Kiedis had become addicted to cocaine and heroin in 1994, so some of the lyrics he wrote were about the effects of drugs.

One Hot Minute did not sell many copies, even though it reached number four on the Billboard 200 chart. Blood Sugar Sex Magik sold twice as many copies as One Hot Minute. In 1998, Navarro was asked to leave the band. Red Hot Chili Peppers told the media it was because they and Navarro liked to make different kinds of music. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic said that "One Hot Minute is as musically ambitious as Blood Sugar Sex Magik, but is even more unfocused, which means it provides the fewest thrills of any of the group's albums."

Alfred Lothar Wegener (1 November 1880 – 13 November 1930) was a German scientist and meteorologist. He is most notable for his theory of continental drift, which he proposed in December 1912. This was the idea that the continents were slowly drifting around the Earth. He also had ideas about why the continents drift, which other scientists thought were impossible. His hypothesis was not accepted until the 1950s. Then several discoveries gave evidence of continental drift, and of the actual causes.

Wegener was born in Berlin and in 1904 he earned his PhD in Astronomy at the University of Berlin. As a reserve officer of the German Army he was called up in 1914 to fight in World War I. He was severely wounded in Belgium and transferred to the army weather service. After the war he mainly did weather work.

[[Motte-and-bailey]]

CATEGORIES: Fortification

A motte-and-bailey is a kind of castle, or fortification. Many of them were built in the 11th and 12th century around Europe.

These structures consist of a hill (the motte) and a courtyard (the bailey). The motte was often artificial and on top, a wooden or stone tower was built. The bailey was surrounded by a protective ditch and wall of wooden fence (a palisade). They were relatively easy to build compared to stone buildings. All the same, they were significant and difficult to overcome.

If they were built of wood, this meant they could be burnt down. Also wood rots when it gets wet so the structure needed regular repair. As time went by castles were made of stone, which is much stronger. Palisades were replaced by stone walls, and wooden tower were replaced in stone. 

Motte and bailey castles appeared in England after the Norman Conquest of 1066. They were a common feature in England by the death of William the Conqueror in 1087. Their construction was the start of what was to become a massive castle building programme in England and Wales.

[[Gynoecium]]

CATEGORIES: Reproductive system, Flowers, Plant anatomy

A gynoecium (from Ancient Greek gyne, "woman") is the female reproductive parts of a flower. The male parts are called the androecium. Some flowers have both female and male parts, and some do not.

Another key term is carpel. Carpels are the building blocks of a pistil. The gynoecium may have one pistil or more. A pistil may have one carpel or more than one stuck together ("fused"). Carpels and pistils have three parts: a stigma at the top where the pollen lands; a style and an ovary. In the case of a pistil, the stigma, style, and ovary may be made up of those parts of more than one carpel, fused.

Plant ovaries are the parts of the gynoecium which (much like animal ovaries) contain ovules. The style is generally stalklike. It is between the ovary at the bottom and the stigma at the top. In some plants, there are no styles in the pistils. The stigma is the pollen receptor at the top of the carpel. Stigmas may be separate or they may be in a region called the "stigmatic region".

[[Cartomancy]]

CATEGORIES: Divination

Cartomancy is the study of reading cards for fortune-telling or divination. There are many different types of cards used for cartomancy, some of which include standard playing cards and the tarot.

Tarot cards are similar to a standard deck of playing cards. In fact, Tarot predates regular playing cards, and might have been the basis for them. The major difference between playing cards and tarot is that tarot decks contain 22 extra cards called the Major Arcana, which are primarily used to read fortunes.

Some Spanish-speaking countries like Mexico use cards similar to bingo for fortune-telling. They call this practice Lotería. Because the game was invented in Italy, Lotería gets its name from the Italian word for lottery.
