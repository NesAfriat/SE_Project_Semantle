The ship of Theseus is a question about if you can consider that an object is the same one when you replace parts of it. It is a paradox.

For example, if you have an axe and you replace its handle, it is still the same axe? And if you replace the blade? And if you made another axe with the old handle and blade, the "real" axe is the one that has the replaced elements or the one that has the old ones?

Different people answer this question in different ways.

The name comes from a legend about ancient hero Theseus.

[[Liver (food)]]

CATEGORIES: Offal

Liver is a food which humans can eat. It is offal, which means it is not muscle tissue. The flavor might be strong for some people, so it might be slightly over-seasoned.

The liver stores vitamin A and other things. Vitamin A is used by the body to make rhodopsin, a molecule which absorbs light. It is needed for low-level vision and colour vision. Vitamin A also plays a key role in gene transcription. It also plays a key role in the immune system.

Once made, vitamin A cannot be broken down by the body, and it is not easily excreted. So it tends to build up in the liver if too much is eaten. Vitamin A is fat-soluble, so getting rid of any excess taken in through diet takes much longer than with water-soluble B vitamins and vitamin C. This allows for toxic levels of vitamin A to build up.

It is not good to eat cooked liver too often. Eating lots of liver, especially from carnivorous animals, will give a person too much vitamin A.

Anna May Wong (born Wong Liu-tsong; January 3, 1905 – February 3, 1961) was an American movie actress. She was the leading Chinese American Hollywood movie star of the pre-WWII era. 

She was the first Chinese American actress to get international recognition. She worked on silent film, sound film, television, theatre, and radio.

Wong played the title character of Fu Manchu's vengeful daughter in Daughter of the Dragon (1931).  Though she was given the starring role, this status was not reflected in her paycheck: she was paid $6,000, while the male lead Hayakawa got $10,000. Warner Oland, who was only in the film for 23 minutes, was paid $12,000.

Wong began using her newfound celebrity to make political statements: late in 1931, for example, she wrote a harsh criticism of the Mukden Incident and Japan's invasion of Manchuria.

The Anna May Wong Award of Excellence is given yearly at the Asian-American Arts Awards; the annual award given out by the Asian Fashion Designers group was also named after Wong in 1973.

English independence is a political stance that wants England to leave the United Kingdom and be an independent country. 

Since the Acts of Union 1707 when it united with Scotland to make the United Kingdom of Great Britain, England has not been an independent country or had any autonomy.

The idea of an independent England is very old and dates back centuries but it has grown in the last few years since Welsh independence and Scottish independence movements have gained large support. Political parties such as the English Democrats and English Independence Party have been founded in the 21st century and want English independence.

There has also been paramilitary groups, such as the English People's Liberation Army, who fought for independence. In 1983, the group claimed they were to blame for a parcel bomb sent to the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament's headquarters.

There have also been calls for an English Parliament, instead of full independence as England is the only country in the UK to not have its own legislature.

If England did manage to gain independence, estimates say that it'd have the world's 5th biggest economy and would be the 15th richest country in the world.

CATEGORIES: Looney Tunes characters, Fictional ducks, Fictional characters introduced in the 1940s

Melissa Duck is an animated cartoon character in Warner Bros.' Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies cartoon series. She is the main character Daffy Duck's blonde girlfriend. Only in one cartoon is she called Melissa.

The 1945 cartoon Nasty Quacks was when Melissa was first introduced. She also plays Baby Melissa in Baby Looney Tunes.

In Nasty Quacks, Daffy's owner, a girl, also becomes the owner of a small, yellow duckling. A jealous Daffy feeds the duckling growth pills. To his surprise, she ages into a white and female duck with blonde hair. By the end of the cartoon, the two have fallen in love. Melissa gives birth to ten black, white and yellow ducklings of her own. 

Melissa first appeared in adult form in a 1950 short, The Scarlet Pumpernickel. In the cartoon, she is the love interest of Daffy Duck and a damsel-in-distress. The plot follows Daffy saving Melissa from having to marry the evil Grand Duke, Sylvester the Cat.

Later in Muscle Tuscle (1953), the girlfriend of Daffy Duck appears with him on the beach. The girlfriend's design is a lot more stylized than Melissa's appearance in The Scarlet Pumpernickel. However, the comtemporary comics adaptation Muscle Tuscle also carried Melissa to this new design.

Another blonde female duck was shown in the 1987 cartoon movie The Duxorcist. This was after the original ''Looney Tunes

ended in 1969.

Melissa Duck was the possible inspiration for Shirley the Loon ("McLoon is her family name). Shirley was on Tiny Toon Adventures.

[[Disgrace of Gijón]]

CATEGORIES: FIFA World Cup, 1982 in association football

The "Disgrace of Gijón" is the name given to the 1982 FIFA World Cup match between West Germany and Austria. It was played at the El Molinón stadium in Gijón, Spain, on June 25, 1982. The match was the last game of Group 2, with Algeria and Chile having played the day before. With the outcome of that match already decided, a win by 1 or 2 goals for West Germany would result in both West Germany and Austria qualifying ahead of Algeria, who had defeated West Germany in the first game. West Germany took the lead after 10 minutes, with the remaining 80 minutes being characterized by few serious scoring attempts on either side. Both teams were accused of match-fixing, although FIFA ruled that neither team broke any rules.

As a result of this, and similar events at the previous World Cup in Argentina, FIFA changed the group system for future tournaments, so that the final two games in each group would be played at the same time. In German, the match is known as Nichtangriffspakt von Gijón (lit. "Non-aggression pact of Gijón") or Schande von Gijón (lit. "Disgrace of Gijón"), while in Algeria it is called فضيحة خيخون (ar, "Scandal of Gijón"); it is also called the Anschluss (in reference to the annexation of Austria by Germany in 1938).

[[Scots law]]

CATEGORIES: Scotland, Law

Scots law is the system of laws used in Scotland, a home nation of the United Kingdom. Scots law is a mixture of a common law system and a civil law system. Scotland has its own judiciary and its own courts. Scotland kept Scots law from the old Kingdom of Scotland after the Acts of Union 1707 formed the British state.

Scots law is different from English law because the two kingdoms of Great Britain in the High Middle Ages and after, the Kingdom of Scotland and the Kingdom of England each had its own system of laws. The Scots jurisdiction kept its own legal system, and Scots law and Scots courts are independent of English law.

After the personal union of Scotland with England and Ireland under their common king, James VI and I, Scotland kept Scots law and England kept English law. After the unification of the Parliament of Scotland with the Parliament of England by the Acts of Union 1707, the new Parliament of Great Britain in London's Palace of Westminster got the power to make Scots laws. The Parliament of Scotland, the old legislature, came to an end. Scots laws started again to be made in Scotland when the new Scottish Parliament came into being as a result of devolution in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Both the British and Scottish parliaments now make Scots law. These two legislatures are sometimes called "Westminster" and "Holyrood", named after the areas of the capital cities in which they meet.

Contrary to the versatility of the highly standardized jeep, which was mostly achieved through field modification, the Dodge WC‑series came in many different, purpose-built, but mechanically uniform variants from the factory, much akin to the later family of High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles. The WC series evolved out of, and was part of a more extended family of trucks, with great mechanical parts commonality, that included open- and closed-cab cargo trucks and weapons carriers, (radio) command cars, reconnaissance vehicles, ambulances, carryalls, panel vans, and telephone installation and mobile emergency / field workshop trucks.

The Dodge WC series were essentially built in two generations. From 1940 to early 1942, almost 82,400 of the 1⁄2‑ton 4×4 Dodge trucks were built — initially called the VC series, but the great majority (from 1941) in the WC series, and in more variants. Contrary to what the nomenclature would suggest, the 1941 WC models were a direct evolution of the 1940 VC models, retaining the U.S. Army's G-505 Ordnance Corps Supply Catalog number.

In 1942, the payload was uprated, and the trucks grew into the G-502 3⁄4-ton 4×4 Truck (Dodge) and the G-507 11⁄2‑ton 6x6 personnel and cargo truck (Dodge) — confusingly retaining the Dodge WC model code. Although the 3⁄4‑tons featured significant design improvements, they did retain some 80% interchangeable components and service parts with the 1⁄2‑ton models — a vital Army requirement, for field maintenance and operability of the trucks.

Dodge was the U.S. Army's main supplier of 1⁄2‑ton trucks, and its sole supplier of both 3⁄4‑ton trucks and 11⁄2‑ton 6x6 trucks in World War II. With over a quarter million units built through August 1945, the G-502 3⁄4‑tons were the most common variants in the WC‑series.

After the war, Dodge developed the 3⁄4-ton WC‑series into the civilian 4×4 Dodge Power Wagon; and in 1951, the WCs were replaced by the very similar 3⁄4‑ton 4x4 Dodge M-series vehicles .

Though the majority of Dodges built were 'Weapons Carriers', "WC" was not abbreviated from this, but a general Dodge model code – initially "W" for 1941, and "C" for a (nominal) half-ton payload rating. However, the "WC" model code was simply retained after 1941 — for both the 3⁄4-ton, as well as the 11⁄2‑ton rated 6x6 Dodges.

All in all, not counting mechanically related variants, the WC series alone involved 52 model versions (thirty 1⁄2‑ton 4×4, eight 1⁄2‑ton 4×2, twelve 3⁄4‑ton 4×4, and two 11⁄2‑ton 6×6 models). Creating vehicles of a common platform in such a variety of designs, with payloads ranging from 1⁄2‑ton to 11⁄2‑tons, had no equal in its time, and is seen as an extraordinary feat of the WWII American auto industry.

Beginning in June 1916, it was placed into regular service with French infantry, where the troops called it the FM Chauchat, after Colonel Louis Chauchat, the main contributor to its design. The Chauchat in 8 mm Lebel was also extensively used in 1917–18 by the American Expeditionary Forces (A.E.F.), where it was officially designated as the "Automatic Rifle, Model 1915 (Chauchat)". A total of 262,000 Chauchats were manufactured between December 1915 and November 1918, including 244,000 chambered for the 8mm Lebel service cartridge, making it the most widely manufactured automatic weapon of World War I.

[[Marcian]]

CATEGORIES: Roman Emperors

Marcian (ˈ; no; Markianós; circa 392 – 26 January 457) was Roman emperor in the east of the Roman Empire from 450 to 457 AD. 

He was a soldier who worked for the generals Ardabur and his son Aspar for fifteen years. When the emperor Theodosius II died on 28 July 450, Marcian was made a candidate to be emperor by Aspar. Aspar had power because he controlled the Roman army.

After a month of negotiation, Pulcheria, Theodosius' sister, agreed to marry Marcian. Zeno, a man with almost as much power as Aspar, may have been part of these negotiations. Zeno got the high title of patrician after Marcian became emperor, perhaps as a reward. Marcian was inaugurated as Emperor on 25 August 450.

Marcian undid many of the acts of TheodosiusnbspII in the Romans' relations with the Huns (led by Attila) and in the organization of the Christian Church. Marcian soon broke all treaties with Attila, ending all subsidy payments to him. In 452, while Attila and the Huns were attacking the Italian Peninsula (part of the western Roman Empire), Marcian's armies attacked across the Danube river into the Great Hungarian Plain. There the Roman armies overcame the Huns in their own country. Because of this, and because of a famine and epidemic in northern Italy, the western Roman Empire was able to bribe Attila into retreating from the Italian Peninsula.

When Attila died in 453, it was the downfall of the Huns' power. Marcian improved the Romans' position by allowing Germanic peoples to live in Roman lands as allies. They did military service in exchange for this right. Marcian called together the Council of Chalcedon, which agreed that Jesus had two "natures": divine and human. This made the populations of Roman Syria and Roman Egypt Marcian's enemies. People in these places did not agree with this official Christology. 

Marcian died on 26 January 457. At the end of Marcian's life, the Empire's treasury was full of money. There were seven million more gold coins than were needed, even though the cost of the wars and treaties with the Huns had been high. After Marcian died, Aspar decided against Marcian's son-in-law Anthemius being emperor. Aspar used his power to make Leo I emperor.

[[Contraposition]]

CATEGORIES: Logic, Mathematics

In logic and math, contraposition is the right way to reverse "if-then" statements. For example, the contrapositive of the sentence "If it is raining, then I wear my coat" is the sentence "If I don't wear my coat, then it isn't raining." If the original sentence is correct, the contrapositive is always correct. 

It is easier to see how contraposition is the right way to reverse an if-then statement by looking at two other reversals that can sometimes look similar, but are bad logic:

Inversion

"If it is not raining, then I don't wear my coat." This is wrong as one can wear a coat for other reasons (eg. It is snowing). In this statement, we have made both the "if" and the "then" statements negative. 

Conversion

"If I wear my coat, then it is raining." This is wrong as wearing a coat doesn't cause it to rain. In this statement we have switched the "if" and "then" statements.

On 23 March 2021, Ever Given, a container ship, got stuck on the shore of the Suez Canal in Egypt. The ship was 400 meters long. A sand storm and strong winds of up to 74 made it hit the banks in the canal. Authorities said that this was not the main reason for the accident and that something probably went wrong with the ship or the crew made a mistake. The ship crashed inside the Suez Canal; it blocked the canal completely and stopped other vessels from passing through.

By 27 March, four days after the ship got stuck, over 300 ships were queueing to pass through the canal while they waited for the problem to be resolved. On March 29th, 2021, the ship was finally free to move again. However, the event made a major impact on the global economy, because all cargo ships traveling across the Suez Canal were delayed.

The mountains range runs in a north–south direction along the coast of Syria. The range is about 120 long. To the west of the mountain range is the plain along the coast, and on the west is the valley of the Orontes. (The Orontes runs through the Ghab Depression.) The tallest mountains in the range are in the north: there their average height is about 3,000, but in the south the average mountains are only 2,000 high. The harbour city Latakia is to the west of the mountain range's highest mountain, which is 5,125 high. Al-Ansariyyah is the only area of land in Syria which has thick forests. 

At the southern end of the mountain range is the plain (the Homs Gap) which separates it from Mount Lebanon, in the country of Lebanon. On the south end is Krak de Chevaliers, a castle of the Middle Ages. In Classical Antiquity, the fresh water that came from these mountains supplied the cities of Antioch, Seleucia Pieria, Apamea, and Laodicea. Laodicea (now Latakia) was famous for its wine (from vines grown in this region), and the Roman geographer Strabo wrote that most of the wine in Alexandria in Roman Egypt came from Laodicea. Latakia was famous in the more recent past for its tobacco production.

The mountain range is the homeland of the Alawites. In the Middle Ages, during the Crusades, the Order of Assassins lived in these mountains.

People often migrate from the mountains to the plain of the coast and to the valley of the Ghab Depression, for economic reasons.

[[The Outlaw Josey Wales]]

CATEGORIES: 1976 movies, 1970s western movies, American western movies, Movies based on books, Warner Bros. movies, Movies directed by Clint Eastwood

The Outlaw Josey Wales is a 1976 American western movie directed by Clint Eastwood (who also stars). It was based on the 1972 novel The Rebel Outlaw: Josey Wales by Forrest Carter. The movie also stars Chief Dan George, Sondra Locke, Bill McKinney, John Vernon, Paula Trueman, Sam Bottoms, Charles Tyner, Doug McGrath, Geraldine Keams and was distributed by Warner Bros. It was nominated for an Academy Award in 1977 and was followed up by The Return of Josey Wales in 1986.

The movie was a commercial success, earning $31.8 million against a $3.7 million budget. In 1996, the film was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress for being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant". It is sometimes said to be a "revisionist western" because it breaks the "long taboo" about the treatment of Missourians by Unionists. This is disputed.

One of the things which made the film "culturally significant" was its use of character actors who could speak in dialects which are now dead or rare. This happened in countries as television spread the standardised type of pronunciation which the media elite use. Dialects can still be detected in regional speech in the U.S.A., but they are not nearly so prominent as they were.

The Besançon Commune (in french Commune de Besançon) was a short-lived revolutionary movement conceived in 1871, aiming at the setting of a local autonomous power based on Lyon and Paris experiences. It originates from sociological changes of the city and creation of unions. The Franco-Prussian War, the fall of the Second Empire, and the advent of the Third Republic, precipitate events. While many notables report an insurrectional context and an armed support from Switzerland, correspondences of James Guillaume and Mikhail Bakunin attest to a confrontation prepared between the end of May and the beginning of June 1871. But with the start of a large repression on May 21 until June 7, any attempt was compromised. Despite the hope of a restart, the months following the idea of an insurrection is definitively abandoned mostly with extinction of the groups and activities called anarchists in 1875.

David Collins (1802, p. 469), Judge-Advocate in colonial Sydney notes, "As a proof of the numbers of those miserable people who were carried off by this disorder, Ben-nil-long told us, that his friend Cole-be’s tribe being reduced by its effects to three persons, Cole-be, the boy Nan-bar-ray, and some one else, they found themselves compelled to unite with some other tribe, not only for their personal protection, but to prevent the extinction of their tribe. Whether this incorporation ever took place I cannot say; I only know that the natives themselves, when distinguishing between this man and another of the same name at Botany Bay, always styled him Cad-i Cole-be; Cad-i being the name of his district; and Cole-be, when he came into the field some time after, appeared to be attended by several very fine boys who kept close by his side, and were of his party." Tindale (1974, p. 193) notes the Cadigal were Kadigal (horde on south side of Port Jackson), Caddiegal.

[[World religions]]

CATEGORIES: Religions

World religions is a category used in the study of religion for the largest and most  widespread religious movements.  Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Hinduism, and Buddhism are always included in the list; they are known as the "Big Five". Some scholars also include other religions, such as Sikhism, Zoroastrianism, or the Bahá'í Faith. The term world religions is used to compare them with other groups, such as indigenous religions and new religious movements.

The term was first used in the 1960s. Scholars such as Ninian Smart first used it, because he wanted to get away from looking at religions form a focus of Christianity. Smart also wanted to take other religious traditions into account. 

The concept of "world religion" has also been criticized: Scholars such as Johnathan Z. Smith have said that it should be abandoned. They say, the concept is bad because it takes the Protestant view as the model of what is a religion. Protestantism is a movement that developed recently. According to the scholars, it takes an uncritical standpoint, and it dictates what religions should be called "major". Other people have argued that the concept is useful, as long as people are aware of its shortcomings.

[[Sanitary sewer]]

CATEGORIES: Water infrastructure

Modern sewer systems often separate rainwater from polluted water. "Wastewater" (polluted water, also called sewage) is treated before it is released into a river or lake again. This treatment may not be needed for rainwater (also called stormwater). This idea of using separate sewer systems for wastewater and rainwater is called sanitary sewer.

A sanitary sewer or foul sewer is an underground pipe or tunnel system for transporting sewage from houses and commercial buildings to treatment facilities. Sewage is treated to control water pollution before discharge to surface waters. 

Cholera is the deadly disease caused by foul water which contaminates drinking water. The system of treating foul water was first invented in London. There cholera had repeatedly caused disease, but in the middle of the 19th century the first successful water treatment plants were invented.

[[Joseph Bazalgette]]

CATEGORIES: 1819 births, 1891 deaths, English people, British engineers, Water pollution, Cholera pandemics

Sir Joseph William Bazalgette, CB (ˈ; 28 March 1819snd15 March 1891) was a 19th-century English civil engineer. He invented the system for cleaning drinking water so as to eliminate cholera.

As chief engineer of London's Metropolitan Board of Works his work was in response to the Great Stink of 1858. He invented the system for cleaning sewage which is basically the same as used today. It stopped the city from having cholera epidemics. Until then, cholera had been endemic in all large cities throughout the world, beginning in Roman times.  

Bazalgette took the polluted water though sewage treatment plants, after which the clean water was returned to the Thames. 

Victorian London became one of the few large cities in the world to be free of epidemics carried by the water supply. The British later built the water and sewage systems in many other countries, especially those in, or connected with, the British Empire (Cairo, Khartoum, New Delhi and so on). The growth in population has made the water unsafe again in many places, but round about 1900 a clean water supply was available in many parts of the world. All this was a consequence of Snow's work, and Bazalgette's engineering..

Cholera has returned in modern times. Cities have outgrown the sewage systems built in the late 19th century. Governments have spent money on armaments rather than engineering. Uncontrolled population growth has meant the return of cholera to a world where it was once eliminated.

Bazalgette was also the designer of the Hammersmith Bridge.

The MK-12 special purpose rifle (SPR) was designed by the U.S. Navy to bridge the gap between the M4 assault rifle and the M24 sniper rifle. It is based off of the AR-15 platform making it semi-automatic unlike the M4 and M16 which are fully automatic. It is chambered in 5.56x45mm NATO and is meant to be used with the 77 grain version MK-262. It has an 18" barrel giving it much more range capabilities than the M4 and the 77 grain MK-262 gave it more range capabilities than the M16. The rifle has a maximum effective range of 700 meters or 770 yards while the M4 has 500 meters and the M16 has 550 meters. It was issued with a Leupold MK-4 2.5-8x36mm scope that was specifically calibrated for the 77 grain ammunition on an 18" barrel. Some MK-12 rifles had a standard A2 stock found on M16 rifles and some had collapsible crane stocks found on MK-18 and M4 rifles. It had a free-float hand rail which gave it superior accuracy by having the barrel completely unaffected by the hand rail. It certainly isn't a light weight rifle weighing in at 10 to 12 pounds depending on if you had a suppressor or not.

[[Choking game]]

The choking game is a challenge that aims to cause unconsciousness by lowering the supply of oxygen to the brain. When becoming conscious again ("waking up"), people often have a euphoric feeling, or a good dream. Most of the time, adolescents try this game. One of the reasons is that they want to experiment with other states of consciousness. If they do it as a group, peer pressure often plays a role. The practice seems to have started in France, in the early 20th century. After the second world war (late 1940s, to early 1950s), several authors described it.

The reasons to play this game are different from those of erotic asphyxiation. Steve Field, chairman of the Royal College of General Practitioners in London, claims that children and teens try the game mainly "to get a high without taking drugs." Children "aren't playing this game for sexual gratification."  It is frequently confused with erotic asphyxiation, which is oxygen deprivation for sexual arousal.  Unlike erotic asphyxiation, adults usually don't play this game.

[[Poststructuralism]]

CATEGORIES: Philosophy

Post-structuralism is a kind of philosophy and way of looking at media. The "Post-" in Post-structuralism means "comes after." "Structuralism" is another kind of philosophy.  Most of post-structuralism is about saying that structuralism is wrong.

The people we call Post-structuralists who wrote about structuralism all had different ideas. A common idea among them was not liking how some structuralists thought the whole world could be thought of as symbols that are opposite to each other. They thought that things in life and in media are more complex than that, so that thinking "this is the opposite of that" was silly. A lot of the time, the post-structuralists said that the things that we think of as the ends of a binary were really made up by other people, and were not really useful or true.

Structuralism says that we can see human culture as a structure that looks like language. It also says that this is not reality, but we can use a "third order" that makes a bridge between the two. A post-structuralist might say that to build meaning out of that, you have to make a mistake and think that the definitions of things are good and don't change. Post-structualists might also say that the structuralist theory is above and not a part of from these structures they are writing things about.

Post-structuralist writers write about how structuralism is too stiff and is wrong to put things in categories.

Writers that have been called post-structuralists include: Roland Barthes, Jacques Derrida, Michel Foucault, Gilles Deleuze, Judith Butler, Jean Baudrillard and Julia Kristeva, although some did not want to be called "post-structuralist."

[[Blue Sky Rangers]]

CATEGORIES: Video game companies

The Blue Sky Rangers is a group of Intellivision game programmers who worked for Mattel in the early 1980s.

When the Intellivision first came out in 1978, its games were made by APh Technological Consulting. When they knew they could get much more profit making them themselves, Mattel created their own software development group. The original five members of that Intellivision team were manager Gabriel Baum, and Don Daglow, Rick Levine, Mike Minkoff and John Sohl. Levine and Minkoff (Minkoff is a long-time Mattel Toys veteran) both came over from the hand-held Mattel games engineering team. To stop them and later programmers (the Mattel team peaked at 110 people in 1983) from being hired away by their rival Atari, their identity and work location was secret.

In 1982, TV Guide published an article about Intellivision's secret programming team. The writer of the article wanted a group name other than "The Application Software Programmers," so he thought of "The Blue Sky Rangers". This was based on the programming group's "Blue Sky Meetings," which were a series of sessions to make new game ideas.

One of the early programmers, Keith Robinson, has owned the rights to Intellivision in recent years and the Blue Sky Rangers' games are now available on multiple computer and video game platforms, as well as mobile phones. He died in June 2017. Intellivision Entertainment, which is owned by Tommy Tallarico, owns the rights to Intellivision, and is making a new console named Intellivision Amico.

Alfried Krupp was part of the Krupp family.  They had a steel-making business in 19th and 20th century Germany.  The Krupp family is famous for taking advantage of war to make money and for enslaving workers during World War II.  At one time, the Krupp company was the biggest maker of weapons in the world.

Krupp was born in 1907 in Essen, Germany.  He joined the Nazi Schutzstaffel (SS) in 1933.  The Krupp company pretended to make farm equipment but they were really making tanks.  They moved and rebuilt factories.  Some of the workers in the factories were enslaved people from concentration camps in the Holocaust.  Historians say there were 100,000 slaved workers and as many as 70,000 of them died.

Historian Harold James says that Alfried Krupp only became leader of the company in 1943, after all the enslaving had happened, and that he was a scapegoat for the company's bad actions.  Krupp was put on trial for war crimes at the Nuremberg Trials.  He was sentenced to 12 years, but he was pardoned in 1951.

The gauge (U.S. English) or bore (British English) is the inside width of the barrel of a firearm.

Lead is poisonous, and builds up in the environment. By 1919, the spent lead pellets from waterfowl hunting was identified as a major source of deaths of bottom-feeding waterfowl. So the tendency is to switch to steel pellets in the cartridge. Dense (heavy) plastic pellets in cartridges is another option, standard in competition shooting.

[[Mangang Luwang Khuman]]

CATEGORIES: Meitei religion, Meitei mythology

Mangang Luwang Khuman is the triple deity of supreme divinity in Sanamahism, the Meitei religion. The three deities are Mangang Sitapa, Luwang Sitapa and Khuman Sitapa. They are also regarded as the progenitors of the Mangang dynasty, the Luwang dynasty and the Khuman dynasty, the three of the seven ruling clan dynasties of Antique Kangleipak (Ancient Manipur).

Mangang, Luwang and Khuman were distinguished by the passionate love for God and self abnegation. This feeling of self effacing love for God as the only ultimate means of realisation and salvation formed the basis of early Meitei religion.

They are represented by the specific divisions of a body, Mangang by head, Luwang by torso and Khuman by tail.

[[Hkakabo Razi]]

CATEGORIES: Geography of Myanmar, Himalayas

Hkakabo Razi is a 5881 mountain in Asia. It is in the Burmese Himalayas range of the Kachin State in northern Myanmar. This mountain is in 3 countries: Myanmar , India, and China. It is the highest mountain in Myanmar. It has been protected as a national park since 1998. The mountain is in Kachin State, the northernmost state of Myanmar.

Takashi Ozaki (Japan, 1951 – May 14, 2011) and Nyima Gyaltsen (aka "Aung Tse"; Myanmar) made the first ascent in 1996. As of 2021, they were the only people to have reached the top of the mountain and to have returned alive. Ozaki had attempted the mountain in 1995 but turned back due to bad weather. The route to basecamp is long (four weeks). A dense rain forest needs to be traversed, with many unbridged stream crossings. Before 1993, foreigners were not allowed travel to the area. This may be one of the reasons why the first successful climb was only done recently.

In 2013, the nearby peak of Gamlang Razi was climbed and measured at 5870 using an advanced version of GPS, making it possibly the highest in Myanmar. Ozaki had confirmed Hkakabo's height as 5881 m, but he did not yet have the GPS equipment to measure the exact height of Hkakabo Razi.

A team was sent out, to measure the exact height, in 2014. They had to turn back at a height of 5742. They estimated that the summit was 800 higher.

The polity was at its height from c. 1450 BCE until its destruction in c. 1200 BCE. This destruction was possibly caused by the mysterious Sea Peoples or internal struggle. The kingdom would be one of the many that fell apart during the Bronze Age Collapse.

[[Fauna of Australia]]

CATEGORIES: Animals of Australia

The fauna of Australia is different from that of Asia. Some 83% of mammals, 89% of reptiles, 90% of fish and insects and 93% of amphibians that inhabit the continent are endemic to Australia. 

The fauna is quite different from that of New Zealand, but is similar to that of New Guinea. That comes about because New Zealand is a volcanic oceanic island with no historical connection with Australia. Its animals have not come from Australia. On the other hand, New Guinea is an island on the same continental plate as Australia, and on the same side of the Wallace line. This was discovered by Alfred Russel Wallace, and explained in a famous series of books. These two huge islands were both part  of the ancient continent of Gondwana, and were not (until modern times) inhabited by animals from Asia. As Gondwana broke up, its two main pieces had marsupial mammals. Eutherian mammals had not arrived from Eurasia. 

This high level of endemism is explained by the continent's long geographic isolation and its tectonic stability (few earthquakes, volcanoes and recent mountain formations). Australia has few placental mammals. Marsupials occupy many of the ecological niches which placental animals occupy elsewhere in the world.

Marsupials are a group of mammals that raise their young in a pouch, including the macropods, possums and dasyuromorphs.  

Australia is home to two of the five known species of monotremes and has numerous venomous species, which include the platypus, spiders, scorpions, octopus, jellyfish, molluscs, stonefish, and stingrays. Uniquely, Australia has more venomous than non-venomous species of snakes.

The settlement of Australia by Indigenous Australians was between 48,000 and 70,000 years ago. Research in 2011 using DNA suggested an arrival around 50,000 years ago. Europeans came from 1788, and significantly affected the fauna. Hunting, the introduction of non-native species, and land-management practices involving the modification or destruction of habitats have led to many extinctions. Some historical examples include the paradise parrot, pig-footed bandicoot and the broad-faced potoroo. Unsustainable land use still threatens the survival of many species. To protect the survival of its fauna, Australia has passed wide-ranging federal and state legislation and established protected areas.

[[Burt Baskin]]

Burt Baskin was the founder of Baskin-Robbins. Baskin was born in the state of Illinois, United States of America on December 17 in the year 1913. Burt Baskin was the son of a Jewish American businessman who owned a clothing store. He attended the University of Illinois and graduated in 1935. After graduation, he joined his father’s clothing business. Later, he opened his own men’s clothing shop in the ground floor of historic Palmer House Hotel in Chicago. During World War II, he served in the US Navy and was assigned in the Southwest Pacific.

He met Irv Robbins when he began dating Robbins' sister in 1941. He soon married into the family, became good friends with Robbins, and the two men decided to go into the ice cream business. At the suggestion of Robbins' father, however, they each opened separate stands, so that each man could better understand the responsibilities of running their own business. Baskin opened his Burton's ice cream stand in 1945, while Robbins opened a shop called Snowbird. They each had several stores by the time they merged in 1948, forming the company that was renamed Baskin-Robbins in 1953.

The company had 43 stores by the end of 1949, more than 100 by 1960 and about 500 when the ice cream empire was sold to United Fruit Company for an estimated $12 million in 1967. Robbins stayed involved with the company for 11 more years and retired in 1978. Twenty-five years later, Baskin-Robbins had become the world's largest chain of ice cream stores, with 5,500 outlets around the world.

Baskin died from a heart attack at his home in Studio City, California on December 24, 1967.

After a period of stagnation at the turn of the 21st century, Botswana's economy had strong levels of growth, with GDP growth exceeding 6-7%.

Bush v. Gore was a United States Supreme Court (SCOTUS) ruling from December 11, 2000 that stopped Florida's manual recount because different Florida counties had different rules for deciding what should count as a valid vote. SCOTUS also disliked the fact that the Florida recount was limited to undervotes (rather than having all of Florida's ballots be manually recounted) and said that there was no time for a new recount in Florida since Florida's Supreme Court said that the Florida state legislature wanted Florida to take advantage of the "safe harbor" deadline on December 12, 2000.

In Bush v. Gore, seven Justices (everyone other than Ruth Bader Ginsburg and John Paul Stevens) agreed that there were Equal Protection problems with Florida's recount, five Justices (everyone other than Ginsburg, Stevens, David Souter, and Stephen Breyer) said that there was no time for a new Florida recount, and three Justices (Chief Justice William Rehnquist, Antonin Scalia, and Clarence Thomas) went a step further than this by saying that in addition to violating the Equal Protection Clause, Florida's Supreme Court also violated Article II of the United States Constitution by changing Florida's election laws.

Coolidge's autobiography has about 45,000 words, unusually short for the time. It was praised by Ray Long (editor of Cosmopolitan magazine) for describing the complete story of Coolidge's life and "the complete story of our country during the dramatic years of this generation." Coolidge was one of the first U.S. Presidents to write and publish an autobiography. Coolidge's autobiography talks about all of the important moments in his life, such as his childhood and youth, Governorship, Presidency, son's death, and retirement. It was criticized by some for being too obvious and not giving any new information that was previously unknown to the public. However, this trait of the autobiography was not that surprising as no one expected Coolidge to reveal some private government information and secrets in his autobiography (Coolidge was a very private man, despite his happy-going and cheerful public personality image). However, it was also praised for its relative shortness, considering that most autobiographies of the time were much longer. Coolidge's autobiography, in contrast, was about half the size of a novel. One of the most important moments in the book was Coolidge's belief that President Warren Harding would recover (in 1923) and then his surprise and inauguration following Harding's death.

The Coolidge autobiography was very popular when it was published, which is seen in the large amount of fan mail that Coolidge got afterwards and by the fact that many newspapers were willing to publish parts of the autobiography so that much more Americans could buy it and view it. Coolidge said that he hoped that his autobiography might guide and encourage the young men and women of America.

The Khmer Empire  or Angkor Empire (Khmer: ចក្រភពអង្គរ, Chăkrâphôp Ângkô are the terms that historians use to refer to Cambodia from the 9th century to the 15th century when the nation was a Hindu/Buddhist empire in Southeast Asia. The empire referred to itself as Kambuja or Kambujadeśa which are ancient terms for Cambodia. The empire grew out of the former civilizations of Funan and Chenla, and at times ruled over and/or vassalized most of mainland Southeast Asia and parts of Southern China, its control stretching from the tip of the Indochinese Peninsula northward to modern Yunnan province, China, and from Vietnam westward to Myanmar.

A notable achievement is the site of Angkor, which is located in present-day Cambodia, the Khmer capital when the empire was the greatest. The majestic monuments of Angkor, such as Angkor Wat and Bayon, show the Khmer Empire's immense power, wealth, art, culture, architectural technique, aesthetics achievements, and the variety of belief systems that the Khmer Empire had over time. Satellite imaging has revealed that Angkor was the largest pre-industrial urban center in the world during the Khmer Empire's peak in the 11th to 13th centuries,.

The beginning of the era of the Khmer Empire is conventionally dated to 802 when King Jayavarman II declared himself chakravartin ("universal ruler", title equivalent to "emperor") on Phnom Kulen. The empire ended with the fall of Angkor in the 15th century.

[[Boot loader]]

CATEGORIES: Software

A boot loader is a program on your computer. It starts other programs, namely operating systems. Boot loaders run booting instructions so your operating system works and appears. This makes using your computer much easier than it would be otherwise.

Boot loaders work on all, or almost all, systems, from MBR (Master Boot Record) to UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface). If a boot loader does not work on your system, you may need to install a different one, use a different configuration, or fix the one it came with.

One of the most common boot loaders is the Windows Boot Manager, also known as bcdboot. It is the only official boot loader for Windows. It also comes preinstalled. Most of the time, there is no real reason to alter it. If you do alter it without full understanding, it is very hard to fix.

A common boot loader on Linux is the GRand Unified Bootloader Two, commonly known as GRUB2 or just GRUB. Other boot loaders include systemd-boot, syslinux, and LILO.

[[Affine symmetric group]]

CATEGORIES: Geometry

Flat, straight-edged shapes (like triangles) or 3D ones (like pyramids) have only a finite number of symmetries. In contrast, the affine symmetric group is a way to mathematically describe all the symmetries possible when an infinitely large flat surface is covered by triangular tiles. As with many subjects in mathematics, it can also be thought of in a number ways: for example, it also describes the symmetries of the infinitely long number line, or the possible arrangements of all integers (..., −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, ...) with certain repetitive patterns. As a result, studying the affine symmetric group extends the study of symmetries of polyhedra or of groups of permutations to the infinite case. It also connects several topics in mathematics that were originally studied for independent reasons, ranging from complex reflection groups to juggling sequences.

[[LZ77 and LZ78]]

CATEGORIES: Algorithms

LZ77 and LZ78 are two different types of lossless data compression algorithms. They were both published in papers by Abraham Lempel and Jacob Ziv in 1977 and 1978. Both of these types of algorithm, LZ77 and LZ78, are mainly designed to compress data without destroying the contents of the data when decompressed. Like all data compression algorithms, LZ77 and LZ78 both use a process called "data compression", or just "compression". Additionally, LZ77 and LZ78 both have their own processes for decompression (a type of process which reverses compression).

LZW is an improved version of LZ78.

[[Great Bath, Mohenjo-daro]]

CATEGORIES: Archaeological sites in Pakistan, History of Pakistan, Sindh, World Heritage Sites in Pakistan

The Great Bath is part of a large citadel complex that was found in the 1920s during excavations of Mohenjo-daro, one of the main centres of the Indus civilization. The bath is built of fine brickwork and measures 897 square feet (83 square metres). It is 8 feet (2.5 metres) lower than the surrounding pavement. The floor consists of two skins of sawed brick set on edge in gypsum mortar, with a layer of bitumen sealer sandwiched between the skins. Water was evidently supplied by a large well in an adjacent room, and an outlet in one corner of the bath led to a high corbeled drain that disgorged on the west side of the mound. The bath was reached by flights of steps at either end, originally finished with timbered treads set in bitumen.

The significance of the structure is unknown, but it is generally thought to be linked with some sort of ritual bathing. Indeed, while lacking impressive palaces or monuments, Mohenjo-daro featured numerous baths—most homes had washrooms—and an extensive sewage system, suggesting that a priority was placed on cleanliness and sanitation.

[[Opioid crisis]]

CATEGORIES: Drugs, Medicine

The opioid crisis or opioid pandemic is the problems with opioid drugs.  Too many people became addicted to opioids.

The crisis started in the United States in the 1990s.  Since then, about 450,000 people have died from opioids in the United States. Most of the people who died took opioids as regular drugs and became addicted. Only a small number of people used the drugs illegally. According to the United States Centers for Disease Control, the opioid crisis costs $78.5 billion a year in the United States alone.

Opioids are moderately strong, to strong painkillers. Despite the high risks, associated with addiction and overdose, they are relatively easy to get. Opioids can have sedative properties. They are useful for treating actute pain; but they are not as effective when treating chronic pain. When looking at chronic pain, the risks often outweigh the benefits.

In 1996, the company Purdue Pharma wanted to sell a number of drugs containing opioids. They told doctors that patients would probably not become addicted, so the doctors prescribed opioids to many patients, even if they did not really need them. Many of those patients became addicted. In 2007, Purdue Pharma was fined $635 million. The judge said this was because Purdue Pharma did not warn customers about the side effects enough. Since then, there have been other similar lawsuits.

In 2017, more than 47,000 Americans died as a result of an opioid overdose, including prescription opioids, heroin, and illicitly manufactured fentanyl, a powerful synthetic opioid. That same year, an estimated 1.7 million people in the United States suffered from substance use disorders related to prescription opioid pain relievers, and 652,000 suffered from a heroin use disorder.

21 to 29 percent of patients given opioids use them wrong in some way. 4 to 6 percent switch from prescription opioids to the illegal drug heroin.

There are different forms, but generally, it involves a boy dancing, wearing women's clothes. The boy also playfully caresses the men he is dancing for. Sexual acts are common. It is also common that force is used to make the boy do things he doesn't want to  do. Security officials state they are unable to end such practices because many of the men involved in bacha bazi-related activities are powerful and well-armed warlords. As of the 2020s, despite international concern and its illegality, the practice continues.  

Bachas should be between twelve and sixteen years old. Using younger boys is seen as a sin. Older boys, which may start growing a beard, may appear ugly. If men have sexual relationships with bachis, they are not seen as homosexuals. Commonly the father will recommend his boy to a group of male friends. The other option is that the father agrees to give his son to a male suitor. This way, the father actis like a pimp. This also protects his son if there's an argument among the group of men. Another form comes from the sourroundings: many famlilies were poor farmers, who had debt. The boy was given as a deposit to pay off some of the debt.

[[Salyut 1]]

CATEGORIES: Space stations

Salyut 1 was the very first space station ever sent into space. It was launched into orbit in April 1971 by the Soviet Union and stayed in space until October 1971. During its time in space, it was visited by two spacecraft with crews. The purpose of Salyut 1 was to learn and test how a space station worked. A second goal was to find out how being in space a long time effected the human body. It had a number of problems but a lot was learned from it that helped with future stations. 

The station was at first part of the Almaz program, to make a secret military station in space. On 16 February 1970 it was decided to make it civilian instead.  The Soviet space program gave the name DOS to the program. That is an abbreviation of the Russian "Dolgovremennaya Orbitalnaya Stanziya" which in English means "Long Term Orbital Station". The first station was called DOS-1 by the people working on space program. To the public, it was to be known as Zarya but was changed to Salyut before launch. Salyut is the Russian word for salute and was given to honor Yuri Gagarin.

The station was shaped like a cylinder and had four areas. One was a docking module to allow a spacecraft to connect. The second was the main module where people could live. The third was the auxiliary module that had the equipment to run the station. The fourth had the engines to move the station. Besides these, the station had four solar panels.

The launch was on 19 April 1971 on a Proton K rocket. Two days later the first crew was also launched on a Soyuz rocket. They were supposed to stay for 30 days at the station. This did not happen as there was a problem in docking (connecting) their spacecraft to the station. After trying for 5.5 hours, they had to return to Earth. A second crew (Soyuz 11) was sent on 6 June 1971 and was able to enter. At first the mission went well. But due to problems on the station they could only stay 23 days of the planned 30. Their stay was the longest any people had spent in space at that time. While at the station they did experiments to help scientists understand life in space. The crew of Soyuz 11 died during re-entry of the atmosphere when their air escaped. No other spacecraft visited the station. Salyut 1 was de-orbited (removed from space) on 11 October 1971. The engines were used to lower the orbit so it would burn up in the atmosphere. 

The design of Soyuz 1 proved to be a good one. Later long-term stations such as Salyut 7 and Salyut 8 were based on it. And parts of Mir and the Zvezda module of the International Space Station were also based on this design.

Soyuz 1 was followed by the Salyut 2 station, which failed.

[[Bowers v. Hardwick]]

CATEGORIES: 1986 in the United States, United States Supreme Court cases, LGBT in the United States

Bowers v. Hardwick was a 1986 United States Supreme Court (SCOTUS) case that said that the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution does not mean there is a a constitutional right for two people of the same gender to have sex.  The case was about two men, so the exact words they used were "homosexual sodomy."

The Supreme Court said that gay sex is not a deeply rooted right in American history and that it would not be possible for SCOTUS to create such a right without also creating a constitutional right to both adult incest and adultery. The majority opinion was written by Justice Byron White. The other justices who agreed were Chief Justice Warren Earl Burger and Justices Lewis Powell, William Rehnquist, and Sandra Day O'Connor. In a brief separate opinion, Chief Justice Burger said gay sex had been called bad for thousands of years, with William Blackstone calling gay sex worse than rape. The dissenting opinion came from Justices Harry Blackmun, John Paul Stevens, William Brennan, and Thurgood Marshall. They disagreed with the majority opinion.  Justice Blackmun said that the 14th amendment could create a constitutional right to have sex with another person of the same gender because of the right to privacy. He said that people have a right to be left alone and that saying this about gay sex did not mean people would be legally allowed to commit adult incest or adultery.

Seventeen years later, the Supreme Court made the opposite decision.  Bowers v. Hardwick was in the 2003 SCOTUS case Lawrence v. Texas.

[[Salyut 3]]

CATEGORIES: Space stations, Soviet spacecraft, Espionage

Salyut 3 was a space station in the Soviet Union's Almaz program. It was also known as OTS-2 and Almaz 2. The size and shape were similar to Salyut 1, but the rest of the design was very different. This was because it was part of the Almaz program instead of the Salyut program. It was only named Salyut 3 to hide its real purpose. In reality it was a military station for spying on other countries. Most details of it were not known until after the Cold War was over.

The station had living areas for cosmonauts, engines, and solar panels. These were similar to other space stations. Due to its military nature, it also had some special equipment. There was a space telescope and several cameras, all for looking at the Earth. A small spacecraft called the Earth-return capsule stored film and could come back to Earth on its own. It was also possible for cosmonauts to develop film on the station and send back the images using a TV system. Salyut 3 also had an onboard cannon (large gun), based on a design used on aircraft.

Salyut 3 was launched into orbit on 25 June 1974 by a Proton rocket. It stayed in space for 213 days before being burned up in the atmosphere. Starting on 4 July 1974 a crew of two cosmonauts stayed at the station for two weeks. Then on 26 August 1974 a second crew arrived but could not connect to the station and so had to return to earth.  After this no other crews visited, but the station could do some tasks on its own. One was sending the Earth-return capsule back. The second was firing the cannon. This is the only time a gun has been fired in space. A total of 20 rounds were fired in 3 bursts.

On 24 January 1975 the station entered the atmosphere and burned up. It was followed by Salyut 4 which was a civilian space station. The next Almaz station was Salyut 5.

[[Polish Corridor]]

The Polish Corridor was a strip of land that was 20 to 70 miles, or 32 to 112 kilometers, wide and that existed between 1919 and 1939 in order to give the newly recreated country of Poland access to the Baltic Sea, as U.S. President Woodrow Wilson's proposed earlier in his famous Fourteen Points speech at the start of 1918. The German-majority city of Danzig was not a part of the Polish Corridor but was instead made a free city under League of Nations rule. Weimar Germany's various governments did not accept the new German-Polish border as being permanent and hoped to change this border later on through negotiations. In March 1939, Nazi German dictator Adolf Hitler said that Poland should agree to Danzig's reunion with Germany and also to the idea of building extraterritorial highways across the Polish Corridor. Poland rejected this proposal and instead got Anglo-French guarantees against Nazi German aggression. Then, when Nazi Germany invaded Poland in September 1939 over this issue, Britain and France declared war on Nazi Germany and World War II began.
