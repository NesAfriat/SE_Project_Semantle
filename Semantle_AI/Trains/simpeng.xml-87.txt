[[Serial position effect]]

The serial position effect is a psychological phenomenon that suggests that people are more likely to remember the first and last items on a list, rather than the middle ones. The term was invented in 1913 by Herman Ebbinghaus, a German psychologist who was interested in testing his ability to remember items on a list (free-recall). To do so he performed free-recall experiments on himself using a list of 2000 made-up syllables. He observed that how well he would remember an item depended on the item's position on the list and is reflected by the serial position curve. The serial position curve reflects two cognitive biases. The first 2-3 items and up to the last 8 items in a list are always better remembered than those in the middle (in lists with 20 or more items). These findings are not influenced by the size and presentation rate (how fast items were presented) of the list. They show a primacy and recency effect.

[[Peak-end rule]]

The peak-end rule is a psychological term proposed by Barbara Fredrickson and Daniel Kahneman. It suggests the following: When evaluating an experience, people do not recall details in every moment they experienced. People mainly recall what happened and how they felt at the peak and the end of the event. The peak is the time when they had the strongest emotion. Our feelings at the peak and the end of the event decide what people generally feel about an experience. The feelings at the peak and the end take up similar weights, which means the memory of the experience is the average of the two.

The peak-end rule is a form of duration neglect. When evaluating past experiences, people concentrate on the peak and the end while other parts of the experience are neglected. How long they have had the experience, is neglected.

According to peak-end rule, humans use false memories to form preferences and make decisions. Thus, decisions are very unlikely to lead to the best outcome they want.   By contrast, the standard economics rational choice theory suggests that humans can always choose something that serves them the best, producing the largest net pleasantness. The establishment of the theory is evidence against the rational choice theory.

[[Pelton wheel]]

CATEGORIES: Engineering

The pelton wheel is a kind of water turbine. It is used in power plants, to convert a water flow into a movement of a wheel (and then into energy). Lester Alan Pelton invented it in the 1870s. In a regular wheel for example of a mill, the energy is obtained from the weight of the water. A pelton wheel uses the impulse of the water to generate energy, not its weight.  Pelton wheels are used in power plants where there's a big difference in height, but where there is relatively little water. An example might be a dam or barrage in the mountains. One of the drawbacks of a pelton wheel is the relatively hight level of wear:  Unlike the Francis turbine, a pelton wheel cannot be used to pump water.

[[Digital television transition]]

CATEGORIES: Television

The digital television transition (also called the digital switchover (DSO), the analog switch-off (ASO), the digital migration, or the analog shutdown) is when analog television signals are turned off so digital terrestrial television (DTT) can be used instead. This is done because it gives a better picture quality for viewers, lets more channels be broadcast in one area, and is cheaper to run. In some places, digital cable, satellite, or internet protocol television replaced analog television instead of DTT.

This started happening in around 2000 when DTT began being used in many countries. It takes a long time to do, because older television sets could not receive DTT signals, and needed either a new television or a set-top box. During this time, broadcasters keep an analog signal broadcasting until enough people have switched to digital. Berlin was the first city to turn off all analog TV signals on 3 August 2003. Luxembourg was the first country to do this completely in September 2006.

[[Conformity]]

CATEGORIES: Social groups

Conformity is when someone changes their behaviour to match that of other people.

It can happen for personal and social reasons. Personally, people conform because they have expectations for themselves. They might believe that behaving a certain way will help them reach a goal. Conformity can also happen because of other people’s influence. People will conform to be liked or to be a part of a group. 

Conformity happens in different levels. Furthermore, the reasons that someone conforms for and what they hope to get out of it, are often linked. Growing up, children learn by copying the behaviours of others. They rely on other’s opinions to be true or on their behaviour to be appropriate. Furthermore, the size of the group matters when conforming.

People conform for normative and informational reasons. Additionally, there is a difference between compliance, identification and internalization. 

There is much research on conformity. Two of the most famous conformity experiments are those by Sherif (1935) and by Asch (1955).

[[Pelasgian]]

Pelasgian is an extinct ancient language (or languages) that according to Ancient Greek and Ancient Roman sources existed in limited areas of Ancient Greece during the 2nd and 1st Millennium BC. 

Herodotus 

Herodotus called it "Barbarian" language but not the Pelasgians (it's speakers). 

Official origin

It's origin and it's form are officially unknown because no Pelasgian literature examples survived. 

Modern theories

The 2 main modern theories about the Pelasgian language suggest that it was a Greek dialect that saw extensive changes or that it was a Western Anatolian language.  

Other Theories

A Bulgarian linguist suggested that the Pelasgians were speaking Thracian. In addition he suggested that the Pelasgians were a sub group of the mysterious late Bronze Age Sea Peoples that caused chaos in the Mediterranean and attacked several cities in the Aegean Sea. This theory has been rejected by most researchers. 

Obsolete theories

During the 19th Century an Austrian diplomat and Albanian speaker suggested a connection between Early Albanian and Pelasgian. Similar claims have been made by modern Albanian nationalistic organizations. This type of theories have been rejected by modern scholars

Interior point methods can be used when the solution is a convex set. The problem can then be restated as minimizing or maximizing a linear function over this set of solutions. They are called interior point methods, because they approximate the convex set from the inside.  Interior point methods are often used because they have a better runtime behavior than the algorithms commonly used with linear programming. Because the sequence of values will converge towards a barrier, they are also known as barrier methods.

[[Hourglass tree frog]]

CATEGORIES: Frogs, Animals of South America

The hourglass tree frog (Dendropsophus ebraccatus) is a frog that lives in Mexico, Colombia, Belize and Nicaragua.  Scientists have seen it as high as 1600 meters above sea level.

The adult male frog is 2.4 to 2.7 cm long and the largest adult female frogs are 3.7 cm long.  Frogs that live high up in the hills are larger than frogs that live low and close to the ocean.  This frog's head is wider than its body.  It has yellow skin and a brown pattern on its back that look like an hourglass. 

Male frogs sing for females after it rains.  The rain creates pools of water that are not there during the dry season.  The males sit on plants high above the pools and sing so the females will come to them.  There are also "sneaker males" who sit between the pools and the singing males so the females will meet them first.

The females lay 180 to 300 eggs at a time.  Most frogs can lay eggs either on land or in water but not both.  However, the hourglass tree frog can lay eggs on both.  If the pool is in the sun, the female frog will lay her eggs on a piece of plant under the surface of the water so that they don't dry out.  If the pool is in the shade, she will lay her eggs near the water so that the tadpoles fall into it after they hatch.  For example, she may lay her eggs on a leaf on a branch hanging over the water.  If she lays eggs in the water, fish might eat them.  If she lays eggs on a leaf, wasps, ants or spiders might eat them.

The tadpoles can be 6.72 to 7.47 mm long when they first hatch and they can grow to 2.9 cm.  They eat algae and hide in underwater plants.

The nematode worm parasite Cosmocerca parva can infect this frog.

This frog does not get very sick from the chytridiomycosis fungal disease the way many other frogs do.  Scientists found that the microbiota of hourglass tree frogs, which is all the bacteria and other microorganisms that live on and in the frog's body, is different from the microbiota of other frogs.  Scientists think this might protect the hourglass tree frog from chytridiomycosis but they are not sure.

Scientists and students use the hourglass tree frog as a test animal because it is not endangered and because it can lay eggs on land or in water.  Humans also keep these frogs as pets.

[[Britain (place name)]]

CATEGORIES: United Kingdom

The name Britain is very old. The name comes from the ancient Romans' name for the ancient Britons (Britons', 'inhabitants of Britain). The English language word comes from no. It can mean Great Britain, the British Isles, or the British state – the United Kingdom.

The Romans started using this name after learning it from the ancient Greeks in the Hellenistic period. The Greeks gave the people of Britain the name in Brettanoí and used as the place name Brettanía.

The Greek name for the people of Britain was also written as Prettanoí, and as Pretanoí. This name may itself have come from one of the Brythonic languages of ancient Britain. The Greek name is like the word for Britain in the Welsh language, which comes from the Old Welsh language word.

There may be a connection between the Greeks' and Romans' name and the Celtic languages. However, it may be that the word comes from one of the languages of the Mediterranean Basin. It could mean "tin". Britain's greatest export in the distant past was tin. Words in ancient Egyptian languages have similarities with the Ancient Greek and Latin names. It is also possible that the word for "tin" in these languages itself came from the name of Britain or its people.

Britannia was the common Latin name for the island of Great Britain starting in the 1st century BC. Britannia replaced the name Albion as the Romans' common name for the island. After the Romans overcame the ancient Britons in war in 43 AD, Britannia could mean just the southern two thirds of the island which was under Roman control. (Caledonia, north of the River Forth in modern Scotland, was only sometimes controlled by the Roman army.)

The writings of the Roman cartographer Ptolemy used the name "Great Britain" for the island in the 2nd century AD. He used the name "Megale Britannia" or "Great Britain" (Μegálē Brettanía) to show the difference between this larger island and Ireland. For Ireland, Ptolemy used the name "Mikra Britannia" or "Little Britain" (Mikrá Brettanía).

The word was used in the Old English language to mean Great Britain. After the time of the Anglo-Saxons, the name Britain was most used in history writing. In the early 16th century however, the name became more common in English for political reasons.

CATEGORIES: Butterflies

Pieris brassicae is the large white, or cabbage white  butterfly. Its caterpillars feed on the leaves of different kinds of cabbage. The imagines (butterflies) have a wingspan of about 60. The cabbage white is a common butterfly that occurs from North Africa up to Fennoscandia. There are two to three generations a year, usually Spring to Autumn. 

The butterfly has been classified as a pest because, of course, its caterpillars eat cabbages. Sometimes, Cotesia glomerata, a parasitic wasp, is used as a means of biological  pest control.

The butterflies are distasteful to birds because of the mustard-oil glucosides the larvae eat. This oil has a distinctive pungent taste. It is in all plants in the mustard family, Brassicaceae (for example, cabbage, cauliflower, turnip, radish, horseradish, or wasabi).

Their white colour is easily seen, and probably acts as a warning sign.

[[Judeo-Christian]]

CATEGORIES: Religion

Christianity started as a movement within Judaism, and later became independent. As a result, many scriptures and ideas are present both in Judaism and Christianity. Since about the 19th century, the term Judeo-Christian is used, to either describe this common heritage, or to show how Christianity developed from Judaism. The term Abrahamic religions also includes other religions, for which Abraham was an important person, most notably Islam. 

At the time of Christ, Judaism was legal within the Roman Empire, and Jews were permitted to worship their religion. Christians were not covered by this arrangement, yet they had in the first century A.D. no Bible: the first book of the New Testament was not written until about 100 AD, though even that date this is not precisely known. It is deduced from its internal content. The other books were written even later. That is why in modern Bibles over half the content is from the Jewish tradition.

For this reason the phrase "Judeo-Christian" says just that Christianity rose from Judaism, and much of its Bible consists of incidents taken from Jewish mythology or history as represented in the Torah.

[[Biedermeier]]

CATEGORIES: Arts

Biedermeier was an time in the arts, which occurred between 1815 and 1848. In 1815, the Congress of Vienna ended the Napoleonic Wars. In 1848, there were revolutions in many European Countries. Between 1815 and 1848, the middle class grew. During that time, the forces that had been active before the French Revolution rose to power again. Politically, the times were very hard, and there was a lot of repression. For this reason, most of the arts focused on apolitical life at home. 

In painting, Biedermeier focused on landscapes, portraits, and perhaps still lifes, or genre paintings. There are almost no religious or historical paintings. Many painters wanted to copy or to resemble 17th century Dutch painters. Many paintings were realist, almost like a modern-day photograph. Interior portraits were typical for Biedermeier: there the idea was to show a fully furnished room, in all its details.

In music, there's no epoch called Biedermeier: the only thing that is perhaps worth mentioning that playing music at home, in the family became important, this is known as house concert.

In theatre, the main focus was entertainment, not like the Age of Enlightenment. Also in addition to the national theatres, a number of smaller theatres started to exist.

[[Gallic Wars]]

CATEGORIES: Roman Republic, Wars and battles of Ancient Rome

The Gallic Wars were military campaigns waged by the Roman proconsul Julius Caesar against tribes in Gaul between 58 BC and 50 BC. The wars gave Rome rich farmlands in Gaul (roughly France and Belgium up to the Rhine).

Caesar's sub-commanders included Mark Antony, Titus Labienus, Quintus Tullius Cicero (brother of Marcus Tullius Cicero), Publius Licinius Crassus (brother of Marcus Licinus Crassus, the richest man in Rome), Decimus Brutus Albinus and Servius Sulpicius Galba.

Julius Caesar described the Gallic Wars in his book Commentarii de Bello Gallico. This is the main source, but it makes impossible claims about the number of Gauls killed (over a million), while claiming few Roman casualties. Modern historians believe that Gallic forces were far smaller than Caesar claimed, and that they (the Romans) suffered tens of thousands of casualties. One of the leaders of the Gauls, Vercingetorix, was taken to Rome, and later executed.

The main contemporary source for the conflict is Julius Caesar's Commentarii de Bello Gallico. This was thought to be truthful and accurate until the 20th century. Even in 1908, Camille Jullian wrote a comprehensive history of Gaul and took Caesar's account as absolutely true. But after World War II, historians began to question if Caesar's claims stood up.

Modern estimates are that at the battle of Alesia, in 52 BC, there were about 70.000 Gauls, and the same number of Roman troops.

Their average annual income is slightly higher than the median for their age, and most are graduates of four-year universities."

[[Cocktail party effect]]

CATEGORIES: Psychology

When they are in a noisy environment, humans have the ability to focus their hearing onto one source. This phenomenon is called cocktail party effect. It is named after the fact that a person attending a noisy cocktail party is able to focus their listening to the conversation  they are doing, and disregard the other conversations. 

It has been proposed that one's sensory memory subconsciously parses all stimuli and identifies discrete pieces of information by classifying them by salience. This effect is what allows most people to "tune into" a single voice and "tune out" all others. This phenomenon is often described in terms of "selective attention" or "selective hearing". It may also describe a similar phenomenon that occurs when one may immediately detect words of importance coming from unattended stimuli, for example hearing one's name among a wide range of auditory input.

An inability to segregate stimuli in this way is sometimes referred to as the cocktail party problem or cocktail party deafness.

A man, Johnny Castaway, is stuck on a very small island with one palm tree. He often fishes, builds sand castles, and jogs. Other things happen less often, such as a mermaid or Lilliputian pirates coming to the island, or a seagull flying down to steal his shorts while he is bathing. Much like the castaways of Gilligan's Island, he is sometimes almost rescued, but is still on the island because of accidents.

Easter eggs happen on some holidays or events often celebrated in the United States, such as Halloween, Christmas and Independence Day, in which a related thing also appears. For example, the palm tree has a "Happy New Year" banner during the last week of the year, and a Jack-o'-lantern is in the sand on Halloween. The time on the computer can be changed to the time of the holiday or event to make it happen at the wrong time.

Johnny Castaway came on a 3½-inch floppy disk and required a computer with, at minimum, a 386SX CPU and Windows 3.1. Now it is widely available on the internet, but because it requires 16-bit software components that do not work in modern versions of Windows, it only works on older versions of Microsoft Windows without workarounds, which exist on Windows 64-bit, Mac OS X and Linux.

Shawn Bird designed the characters while he was at Dynamix. The program was developed by Jeff Tunnell Productions, the Jeff Tunnell in the name meaning the founder of Dynamix. Ken Williams said the screensaver was one of Dynamix's products that did not cost much money to create and make, and made them much more money, along with The Incredible Machine and Hoyle Card Games, which Sierra also published.

Bernard Johannes "Joost" Eerdmans (born 9 January 1971) is a Dutch politician and former civil servant.

Eerdmans was born in Harderwijk and studied public administration at Erasmus University Rotterdam.

He worked at the justice department and as an assistant to Rotterdam mayor Ivo Opstelten.

As a junior civil servant he founded with other junior civil servants the youth organisation FUTURE in 1997. The purpose of FUTURE was to give civil servants more responsibility for what they are doing.

Eerdmans got impressed by the performance of critic Pim Fortuyn. He joined the Pim Fortuyn List (LPF) and became an MP in 2002. After leaving the LPF because of the ongoing upheaval, he established with Marco Pastors the Eén NL party in 2006, but the party failed in the 2006 Dutch general election, so he lost his seat.

Subsequently he worked as a columnist, as a manager at Deloitte consultancy, and as a radio and TV presenter. Keen on law and order, he also founded a civilian committee against injustice in 2009.

Meanwhile, Eerdmans became active in local politics. From 2009 to 2014 he was an alderman of Capelle aan den IJssel on behalf of Livable Capelle. From 2014 to 2018 he was an alderman of the neighbouring city of Rotterdam on behalf of Livable Rotterdam. From 2018 to 2021 he was a municipal councillor and Livable Rotterdam group leader in this city.

In the run-up for the 2021 Dutch general election he became a candidate for the Forum for Democracy (FVD) party but broke up after dubious comments of FvD leader Thierry Baudet.

Afterwards he established with Annabel Nanninga the conservative liberal JA21 party, of which he is both party leader and list puller. JA21 gained three seats, so he has been parliamentary group leader and an MP since March 2021.

Joost Eerdmans is married with two children and lives in Rotterdam.

It may mean a small group, such as the living things in a piece of dead wood. Populations of many species make up a community when joined together. A community with its physical and chemical environment makes an ecosystem. Each population can have an effect on other populations in the community in different ways, which are called symbiosis.

In consumption, one living thing eats another. Three kinds of consumption are predation, herbivory, and parasitism. In predation, one animal, the predator, kills and eats another animal, the prey. In herbivory, an animal called an herbivore eats a plant, either in part or in whole. In parasitism, a parasite lives on another living thing, the host. The parasite eats small parts of tissue or nutrients from the host, but usually does not kill it.

In competition, two living things, from the same or different species, both need the same resources. If one species is better at getting the resources, the population of the other species may die out. Competition may have a negative effect on both species. In mutualism, two species both help each other, so they have a positive effect on each other. In commensalism, one species is helped, but it has no effect on the other species.
