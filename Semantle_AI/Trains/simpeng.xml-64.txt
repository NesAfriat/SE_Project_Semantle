[[Positron emission tomography]]

CATEGORIES: Medical imaging

Positron Emission Tomography (often called PET) is a medical imaging technique. A specially constructed device can show the path and distribution of a weakly radioactive substance. This substance is called tracer. The tracer  dissolves in the blood, which will carry it the brain. There, it concentrates around brain structures that are particularly active. A PET scan detects the radioactivity and converts it into a digital image of the brain, highlighting the active areas. PET scans are often used to detect tumors. Different tracers are used for different kinds of scans. Very often, the tracers are similar to sugar, or are sugars which have been specially modified for the purpose.

The machinery which can detect these substances is expensive. The tracers have a half-life of around 30-60 minutes, Producing the tracer is difficult, and expensive. Because of different factors, the tracers need to be prepared for the event, they cannot be mass-produced.

[[Meissner effect]]

CATEGORIES: Magnetism

The Meissner effect is when a magnetic field is pushed out of a superconductor when it becomes superconducting. If you were to put a superconductor in the field of a big magnet and you looked just inside the superconductor, you would see that the magnetic field was much smaller than it was outside. The deeper in you looked, the closer it would be to zero. This is one of the ways that superconductors are not the same as perfect conductors, which do let magnetic fields pass through them.

The effect was discovered by Walter Meissner and Robert Ochsenfeld in 1933. They saw that because the magnetic field cannot go through the superconductor, the field right outside the superconductor becomes stronger.

One example of the Meissner effect is a magnet levitating above a superconducting plate cooled by liquid nitrogen. In order to stop the magnetic field from going into the superconductor, the superconductor acts like a magnet pointing the opposite direction. This repels the real magnet and stops it from coming any closer.

In France, a subprefecture (sous-préfecture) is the administrative center of a departmental arrondissement that does not contain the prefecture for its department. The term also applies to the building that houses the administrative headquarters for an arrondissement.

The civil servant in charge of a subprefecture is the subprefect, assisted by a general secretary. Between May 1982 and February 1988, subprefects were known instead by the title commissaire adjoint de la République.

Where the administration of an arrondissement is carried out from a prefecture, the general secretary to the prefect carries out duties equivalent to those of the subprefect.

[[Ion exchange chromatography]]

CATEGORIES: Laboratory techniques, Chemistry

Ion exchange chromatography (or ion chromatography) is a process in chromatography that separates ions and polar molecules based on their attraction to the ion exchanger. It works on almost any kind of charged molecule—including large proteins, small nucleotides, and amino acids. The two types of ion chromatography are: "anion-exchange" and "cation-exchange" chromatography. They are used in protein purification, water analysis, and quality control.

The water-soluble and charged molecules such as proteins, amino acids, and peptides bind to moieties which are oppositely charged by forming ionic bonds to the insoluble stationary phase.The equilibrated stationary phase is made of an ionizable functional groups where targeted molecules of mixtures are separated and quantified while passing through the column. A cationic stationary phase is used to separate anions and an anionic stationary phase is used to separate cations. Cation exchange chromatography is used when the desired molecules to separate are cations and anion exchange chromatography is used to separate anions.

[[Pliny's Comedy and Tragedy villas]]

CATEGORIES: Buildings and structures in Ancient Rome

Pliny's Comedy and Tragedy villas were two Roman villas owned by Pliny the Younger in the 1st century. They were on the shores of Lake Como in northern Italy. Pliny had several villas on Lake Como. He wrote to his friend Voconius Romanus that the Comedy villa and the Tragedy villa were his two favorites. In Italy, the villas are called Villa Commedia and Villa Tragedia. In Italian, "commedia" means "comedy" and "tragedia" means "tragedy".

In his letter to Voconius Romanus Pliny also wrote that the Tragedy villa was on a hill above the lake but that the Comedy villa was right on the water's edge. Their names come from the theatre of ancient Greece and Rome. Pliny said that the villa on the hill was like the actors in tragedies who wore platform boots. He named that villa "Tragedy". The villa down by the water was like the actors in comedies who wore flat slippers. He named that villa "Comedy". Both villas were destroyed long ago. No one is sure exactly where they stood.

Most people think that the Tragedy villa  was in Bellagio, a small town on Lake Como. People are less sure where the Comedy villa was. The historian Paolo Giovio (1483-1552) thought that by the 16th century the Comedy villa was under the water of Lake Como near the village of Lenno. The geographer Abraham Ortelius (1527–1598) also wrote that the Comedy villa was in Lenno. But in 1876 a Roman mosaic floor and many Roman coins were found in Lierna, another small town on Lake Como. Many people there now think that the mosaic floor was part of the Comedy villa. In the early 20th century the French geographer Élisée Reclus wrote that Lierna was the site of one of Pliny's villas, but he did not say which one.

In 1751 John Boyle, 5th Earl of Orrery, published his English translation of Pliny's letters. The letter to Voconius Romanus describing the Comedy and Tragedy villas was illustrated with an imaginary picture of the Comedy villa drawn by Samuel Wale. The art historian Pierre de la Ruffinière du Prey, has said that the villa in Wale's drawing looks like Alexander Pope's villa on the River Thames in London. Alexander Pope was a friend of John Boyle. Pliny's own description of the Comedy villa in his letter said that its terrace was gently curved like the shore of the lake. He could fish directly from his bedroom window. He said that lying in his bed at the Comedy villa was like lying in a fishing boat on the lake.

[[Microservices]]

CATEGORIES: Computer science

In classical software architecture, the architecture is often layered. There is one layer for the user interface, another for the application logic, and yet another for accessing persistent data (such as a database). In classical software architecture, an application server is used, which will run the different services (such as different entrypoints of a web site, or different parts of the business application). The problem with this approach is that such application servers often do not scale very well, they need a lot of resources, and services are often tightly coupled.

Microservices are patterns of Software architecture: The approach is similar to the pattern described above, but the services are very small: very often they only provide one or two very specific functions. To get the same situation as above, these services must interact with each other. Very often they do this using RESTful service calls. Each microservice still has the parts of the user interface layer, the application layer, and the layer to access persistent data. Very often, microservices run in an application container. When the load requires it, special software in the application container can be used to run several instances (or copies) of the specific service.

Importantly, he created complex analysis, which studies complex functions and their properties. Cauchy graduated the École Polytechnique. Cauchy did not like mathematicians making assumptions, and he particularly did not like the way that earlier mathematicians, such as Euler and Lagrange, assumed that properties of finite expansions, meaning that we can count the number of terms, also worked for infinite series. Cauchy was able to give examples of where this did not work, and called the assumptions that the earlier mathematicians made, the generality of algebra. More theorems have been named after Cauchy than any other mathematician in history.

[[Ogdoad (Egyptian)]]

CATEGORIES: Egyptian gods and goddesses, Creation myths

In Egyptian mythology, the Ogdoad are a group of eight deities (divine beings) worshipped in Hermopolis. The gods of the Ogdoad were mostly seen as humans with the heads of animals, or just depicted as snakes and frogs. They were arranged in four male-female pairs, with the males associated with frogs, and the females with snakes. Their story is part of the Egyptian creation myth.

The Egyptians believed that before the world was formed, there was a watery mass of dark, directionless chaos. In this chaos lived the Ogdoad of Khmunu (Hermopolis). These were four frog gods and four snake goddesses of chaos. Together they represented balance in infinity.

Their names were Nun and Naunet (water), Amun and Amaunet (invisibility), Heh and Hauhet (infinity) and Kek and Kauket (darkness).

The chaos existed without the light, and thus Kek and Kauket came to represent this darkness. They also symbolized obscurity, the kind of obscurity that went with darkness, and night.

The Ogdoad were the original great gods of Iunu (On, Heliopolis) where they were thought to have helped with creation, then died and retired to the land of the dead where they continued to make the Nile River flow and the sun rise every day.

[[Packet switching]]

CATEGORIES: Computer networking

Packet Switching

Composed of a header and a payload:

A header is used by networking hardware to direct packets to its destination,

A payload is the thing extracted after it has reached its destination (thanks to the header)

The workstation creates a packet, and stamps it with the destination's IP Address and forwards it to a router, the router's job is to find out how to get the packet to the desired destination.

Breaking communication down into packets allows the same information to be shared amongst many users in a network.

A type of small network where packets (small units of data) are routed through a network based on the destination address contained in each packet.

“A data packet is a unit of data made into a single package that travels along a given network path. Data packets are used in Internet Protocol (IP) transmissions for data that navigates the Web, and in other kinds of networks.”

[[Republic of Liberia national defence forces]]

CATEGORIES: Liberia

The Federal republic of Liberia military book, entitled, “The History of the Liberian Armed Forces Day” before February 25, 1955, there was no Armed Forces Day as such, except the country and militia units, each of which had its own quarterly parade day enacted by law.

During those days, the regular Army then called the Liberian Frontier Force (LFF), used to combine with units of the national militia to have joint parade on special occasions, such as Independence Day, Inauguration Day, etc. However, in 1954, the late Colonel Francis M. Dean, then Assistant Chief of Staff (G-2), recommended in his annual report to the Defense authority that a day be set aside by an act of the National Legislature to be styled and known as “Old Soldier Army Festival” a day on which units of the Liberian Armed Forces throughout the nation would assemble at their respective headquarters to jointly participate in field ceremonies of parades and other planned military exercises.

Colonel Dean’s recommendation traveled through the necessary chain of command until it successfully reached the official desk of the late Commander-In-Chief, President William V.S. Tubman who, in turn, approved and submitted it to the lawmakers for legislative consideration.

How February 11 Was Chosen As Armed Forces Day

When the Liberian legislature met in session to consider colonel Dean’s recommendation for legislative enactment, it was suggested that choosing any month and date to be set aside as Army Festival would be inappropriate.

Instead, a month and date with some historical events in which a member or members of the Armed Forces had performed some marvelous deeds in the supreme interest of the nation (Liberia) and its people.

By so doing, members of the incoming generations of the Armed Forces would continue to celebrate this day under appropriate military exercises in honor and remembrance of the heroic deeds of their comrades in arms. Moreover, this suggestion was embraced with popular support. However, the only event that could quickly come to the minds of the lawmakers was the month and date of the Major Mckay Cadell incidence in 1909.

Major Cadell was the first commandant of the Liberian Frontier Force who carried on mutiny action against the Liberian Government during President Arthur Barclay’s administration, that aggression of Cadell was repelled by the first militia regiment headed by Ltc. Isaac Moart and his deputy Major.

Joseph Dennis in 1909 having reached a unanimous consensus on the month and date of Major Cadell’s event, of February 25 1955, an act of Legislature was passed, declaring May 9 of each year as Armed Forces Day with a proclamation that it should be officially observed throughout Liberia as a National holiday. When the Act was proclaimed on May 9 as the month and date of the Major Cadell’s incidence, historians everywhere disagreed and argued that the incidence occurred on February 9, 1909. This argument in turn created a demand for legislative amendment.

Consequently, on March 22, 1956, amendment was made, deleting May 9 and inserting February 9 in the Act as Armed Forces Day. Less than a year after the amendment was made, some survivors of the Major Cadell’s incidence declared that it was February 11, 1909.

Once more and finally, on January 26, 1957, the appropriate rectification was made in the Act. Major Cadell was a British officer brought to Liberia from Sierra Leone to command the Liberian Frontier Force, and with him were some Sierra Leonean soldiers whom he incited against the Liberian Government for salary arrears.

The Liberian Frontier Force thwarted their mutiny action and they were given twenty-four hours to leave Liberia. The current site of the Executive Mansion was the location of the Military Barracks named and styled “Camp Johnson”. Today, a new 2000-strong AFL is being built under the auspices of the Security Sector Reform (SSR) program.

DynCorp International is training this new 2000-strong regimented and law-abiding AFL with support from the United States Government.

Note- The Armed Forces of Liberia is 100 years, (1908-2008) and this celebration of Armed Forces Day marks the 51st observance of the day since 1957.

[[Physical unclonable function]]

CATEGORIES: Cryptography, Numbers

Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) are hardware modules that can generate randomness. Their operation is based on "locked" randomness, stemming from tiny imperfections (mistakes) in the manufacturing process of hardware, which result in the production (output) of a bit-string which appears random and can be considered as unique per hardware instance (device).

Essentially, in each PUF circuit, electric current may move through this circuit in two distinct ways/paths, such as two wires. If it goes mostly through one of these ways/paths, a logical zero is produced, whereas if it goes through the other way/path, a logical one is produced. The prevalent path is chosen according to tiny details (characteristics) of the circuit, such as which wire is thicker or longer. However, the two wires have been designed to be exactly the same, and only differ because of imperfections of the manufacturing process, which cause random tiny mistakes (imperfections), such as one wire being 5 mm, and the other 5.00001 mm. Therefore, and as the choice of the prevalent path is dependent on a large number of tiny details (thickness, length, resistance of the wires, etc.), which are very difficult to determine beforehand, this choice appears as random, and can be considered as chaotic. The tiny production mistakes that affect the path choice cannot be predicted as they happen randomly in the manufacturing process. Nevertheless, after they happen, they stay like that, for example, the small difference in length between two wires will always exist after they have been manufactured, so the aforementioned path choice is "locked", although it is "random" (chaotic), and will always give the same result.

Since most contemporary hardware devices consist of millions of circuits, millions of individual choices can be made at the same time, resulting in a string (series) of bits (zeros and ones) of a very large length. Since each choice is independent and "random", the probability that two such strings will be the same becomes extremely small due to their very large length. Therefore, a PUF can be used to produce a large bit-string that will be unique per device and always the same, when measured under exactly the same conditions. Such a bit string can then be used in cryptography as an inherently occurring cryptographic token, such as a key for encryption. As external (environmental) conditions may affect the result of a PUF (its "random" unique bit-string output), error correction may be needed to force this result to be the same between different measurements.

Hardware, which by its nature allows for a choice of path for electricity, such as memory cells, can be easily employed in order to implement a PUF in a device, without the need of additional circuitry. Therefore, PUFs can be quite cost-efficient and lightweight.

In the context of Sanskrit, anusvara may also refer also to the nasal sound itself.

অনুস্বার onushshar in Bengali is written as a circle above a slanted line (ং), and represents /ŋ/. It is used in the name of the Bengali language বাংলা baŋla.

[[Wikipedia administrators]]

CATEGORIES: Wikipedias, Internet, Occupations

Wikipedia administrators are senior, trusted volunteers who have been selected by the Wikipedia community. They are also known as admins, sysops, and janitors327. Administrators are chosen following a successful request for adminship. As of CURRENTMONTHNAME CURRENTYEAR, there are NUMBEROFADMINS administrators on the Simple English Wikipedia. Administrators have special rights that other editors do not have.

On Wikipedia, becoming an admin is often referred to as being "given taking up the mop", a term which has also been used elsewhere. 

In his book Wikipedia – The Missing Manual, John Broughton states that while many people think of administrators on Wikipedia as judges, that is not the purpose of the role. Instead, he says, admins usually "delete pages" and "protect pages involved in edit wars".

==History on the English Wikipedia== 

In 2006, there were about 1,000 administrators on the English Wikipedia, and in 2020 about 1,100. These administrators live in different parts of the world. 

In July 2012, it was reported that Wikipedia was "running out of administrators". This was because in 2006-2007 an average of 40-50 new administrators were appointed. In the first six months of 2012 only 9 new administrators were appointed. But the co-founder of Wikipedia, Jimmy Wales, did not believe that this was a crisis. He also did not believe Wikipedia was running out of admins. He thought the number of admins did not change much. Wales said earlier that being an admin is "not a big deal”. He also said that "It's merely a technical matter that the powers given to sysops are not given out to everyone.” He said this in a message he sent to the English Wikipedia mailing list on February 11, 2003.

As a result patients suffer from shortness of breath.

In some patients the cause of the disease can be diagnosed, but in others the cause is unknown, a condition called idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. There is no known cure for the scars and damage in the lung due to pulmonary fibrosis.

[[Collapse of Hotel New World]]

CATEGORIES: 20th century in Singapore, 1986 in Asia

On 15 March 1986, in one of Singapore’s worst civil disasters, the Lian Yak Building (better known as Hotel New World) collapsed. 33 people died and 17 were rescued alive from the rubble.

The Singapore Fire Service (SFS) (present-day Civil Defence Force), the Armed Forces and the police all assisted in the rescue operation. Passers-by and nearby residents also joined in, helping to clear the rubble and pull out survivors. SAF medical officers and MOH doctors present took turns to crawl through narrow spaces inside the rubble to try and provide assistance to trapped survivors, giving glucose and saline drips to them. At first, power saws and drills were used to cut through the rubble and reach survivors; however the use of heavy machinery posed a risk to people trapped under the rubble. 

This led to concern among tunnelling experts from Britain, Ireland and Japan who were involved in nearby construction for the Mass Rapid Transit, which included Thomas Gallagher, Thomas Mulleary, Patrick Gallagher, Michael Prendergast, and Michael Scott; as well as Tan Jin Thong, Deputy Director (Operations) SFS.

They volunteered to dig 4 tunnels under the rubble, which resulted in the rescue of another eight survivors. They later received the Pingat Gagah Perkasa (Conspicuous Gallantry Medal) for their actions.

The investigation found that during the calculation of the building’s structural load, only the LIVE LOAD (weight of people in the building, and additional fixtures and fittings, such as furniture) was factored in. The DEAD LOAD (weight of the building itself) was completely omitted from the calculation. This meant the building was not designed to support its own weight. It was later discovered that an unqualified draftsman, instead of a professional structural engineer, did the calculations for the building. The owner (which died in the collapse) also requested to use inferior materials in construction, in order to reduce the cost.

After the incident, Singapore’s building safety regulations were updated. Since 1989, all structural designs/calculations must not only be prepared by a Professional Engineer, but also counter-checked by an independent Accredited Checker.

[[Haloalkane]]

Haloalkanes are alkanes that contain one or more halogens. A variety of different reactions can form these organic compounds. They cannot quickly be reacted, making them reasonably stable.

There are many kinds of haloalkanes, used for many purposes. Haloalkanes can be primary, secondary, or tertiary and could contain more than one type of halogen. Some haloalkanes contain no hydrogen atoms.

Whether the haloalkane is primary, secondary, or tertiary depends on where the halogen is placed in the molecule. Halogens placed on carbon that is attached to one other carbon atom makes the haloalkane a primary alkane. Halogens placed on carbon that is attached to two other carbon atoms makes the haloalkane a secondary alkane. Halogens placed on carbon that is attached to two other carbon atoms makes the haloalkane a secondary alkane. Halogens placed on carbon that is attached to three other carbon atoms makes the haloalkane a tertiary alkane.

(Maybe Omega is an alien from a planet that's much more technologically advanced than ours.)  You know that Omega has often correctly predicted your choices in the past (and has never made an incorrect prediction about your choices), and you also know that Omega has correctly predicted the choices of other people, many of whom are similar to you, in the particular situation about to be described.There are two boxes: A and B. Box A is see-through and contains $1,000. Box B is opaque, and contains either $0 or $1,000,000. You may take both boxes, or only take box B.Omega decides how much money to put into box B.  If Omega believes that you will take both boxes, then he will put $0 in box B.  If Omega believes that you will only take box B, then he will put $1,000,000 in box B.Omega makes its prediction, puts the money in box B ($0 or $1,000,000), presents the boxes to you, and flies away.  Omega does not tell you its prediction, and you do not see how much money Omega put in box B.What do you do?

[[Danish resistance movement]]

CATEGORIES: 20th century in Denmark, Resistance movements of World War II

The Danish Resistance Movement was an underground movement organized to resist the Nazi German occupation of Denmark during World War II. Due to the initially lenient arrangements, in which the Nazi occupation authority allowed the democratic government to stay in power, the resistance movement was slower to develop effective tactics on a wide scale than in some other countries.

By 1943, many Danes were involved in underground activities, ranging from producing illegal publications to spying and sabotage. Major groups included the communist BOPA (Danish: Borgerlige Partisaner, Civil Partisans) and Holger Danske, both based in Copenhagen. Resistance agents killed an estimated 400 Danish Nazis, informers and collaborators until 1944. After that date, they also killed some German nationals.

In the postwar period, the Resistance was supported by politicians within Denmark and there was little effort to closely examine the killings. Studies were made in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, and people learned that there was sometimes improvised and contingent decision making about the targets, with some morally ambiguous choices.

CATEGORIES: Cancer, Deaths from uterine cancer

Uterine cancer, also known as womb cancer, is any type of cancer that starts from the tissue of the uterus. It can refer to several types of cancer, with cervical cancer being the most common type worldwide and the second most common cancer in women in developing countries. Endometrial cancer (or cancer of the inner lining of the uterus) is the second most common type, and fourth most common cancer in women from developed countries.

Risk factors depend on specific type, but obesity, older age, and human papillomavirus infection add the greatest risk of developing uterine cancer. 

Early on, there may be no symptoms, but irregular vaginal bleeding, pelvic pain or fullness may develop. If caught early, most types of uterine cancer can be cured using surgical or medical methods. When the cancer has extended beyond the uterine tissue, more advanced treatments including combinations of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or surgery may be required.

[[Cousin marriage]]

CATEGORIES: Marriage, Genetic disorders

Cousin marriage (sometimes called cousincest) is marriage between cousins. In some places like the Middle East it is common. In other places it is illegal. A famous cousin marriage is that between Charles Darwin and his wife Emma.

The main argument against cousin marriages is that it increases the likelihood of genetic defects occurring in children of such marriages. The classic example of this is the occurrence of haemophilia (and some other conditions) in the royal families of Europe. The repeated marriages between close relatives increased the chance of recessive genes arriving on both chromosomes of a pair, so causing defects to appear. Of course, pre-scientific societies would not have known this. However, they would have seen the results of continual close marriages, such as the brother-sister matings in the Ancient Egyptian royal lines.

The creator of the game, Dan Salvato, was working on the game for close to two years. Before creating this game, Salvato created modifications, or "mods", to Super Smash Bros. Melee. At first, Doki Doki Literature Club! was released on itch.io then released on Steam. The game is free, but if you pay $10, you can receive the downloadable content.

[[Shinjitai]]

CATEGORIES: Writing systems, Chinese language, Chinese characters

Shinjitai (kanji: 新字体, kana:しんじたい) literally means "new character forms" in Japanese. These are kanji (the Japanese word for Chinese characters) that were simplified in Japan after World War II. At that time the Japanese government changed the writing system by replacing many kyūjitai (kanji: 旧字体, kana: きゅうじたい, meaning: old character forms) by making simpler characters. These newer characters had the exact same meaning and pronunciations as the older ones, but they could be written with fewer strokes of a pen. For example, the character 樂 simplified to 楽. Some shinjitai characters are also used as simplified Chinese characters. For example, the character 国 is used in both Japanese and simplified Chinese. However, most shinjitai look more like traditional Chinese characters (called kyūjitai in Japanese) than even simplified Chinese characters do, and there are also far fewer shinjitai than simplified Chinese characters. While most Japanese words these days use the shinjitai form, there are a few words where writing the kyūjitai form is still common. For example, the word "dragon" is usually written using the shinjitai character 竜, but writing the kyūjitai character 龍 for it is also still quite common. For most kanji, however, the shinjitai form is unchanged from the kyūjitai form.

The Gotthard Base Tunnel (GBT; Gotthard-Basistunnel, Galleria di base del San Gottardo, Tunnel da basa dal Son Gottard) is a railway tunnel in Switzerland. With a route length of 57.09, it is the longest tunnel in the world. The link consists of two single-track tunnels connecting Erstfeld (Uri) with Bodio (Ticino) and passing below Sedrun (Graubünden). The main purpose of the Gotthard Base Tunnel is to increase local transport capacity through the Alpine barrier, especially for freight, notably on the Rotterdam–Basel–Genoa corridor, and more specifically to shift freight volumes from trucks to freight trains. This both significantly reduces the danger of fatal road crashes involving trucks, and reduces the environmental damage caused by  heavy trucks. The tunnel provides a faster connection between the canton of Ticino and the rest of Switzerland, as well as between northern and southern Europe, cutting the Basel/Zurich–Lugano–Milan journey time for passenger trains by 1 hour (and from Lucerne to Bellinzona by 45 minutes). After 64 percent of Swiss voters accepted the NRLA project in a 1992 referendum, first preparatory and exploratory work began in 1996. The official start of construction began on 4 November 1999 at Amsteg. As of 1998, the total projected cost of the project was CHF 6.323 billion; as of December 2015, the final cost is projected as CHF 9.560 billion.

[[Cybercrime]]

CATEGORIES: Computing

Cybercrime is crime that uses a computer and computer network. There are many types of cybercrimes. These include doxxing, hacking, copyright issues, cyberterrorism and fraud. Many countries have laws against many types of porn such as twincest, fauxcest, child porn, bestiality and others.  Some other actions can also be illegal such as cyberbullying, spying, child grooming or hebephilic behavior. Some governments have agencies that deal with computer crimes.

A primary effect of cybercrime is financial; cybercrime can include many different types of profit-driven criminal activity, including ransomware attacks, email and internet fraud, and identity fraud, as well as attempts to steal financial account, credit card or other payment card information. Cybercriminals may also target an individual's private information, as well as corporate data for theft and resale.

Cybercrime attacks can begin wherever there is digital data, opportunity and motive. Cybercriminals include everyone from the lone user engaged in cyberbullying to state-sponsored actors, like China's intelligence services. Cybercrimes generally do not occur in a vacuum; they are, in many ways, distributed in nature. That is, cybercriminals typically rely on other actors to complete the crime. This is whether it's the creator of malware using the dark web to sell code, the distributor of illegal pharmaceuticals using cryptocurrency brokers to hold virtual money in escrow or state threat actors relying on technology subcontractors to steal intellectual property (IP).

[[Action camera]]

While action camera is made for filming, it can also take pictures. All films and pictures it took will be kept on a tiny card that you can pull them out and watch them later.

Action camera is made to be small and very light, so that a person who wear it does not feel its weight while doing his or her things. And it usually uses wide-angle lens to film as many details around as possible. Inside the camera, there is a battery that lasts long enough for you to film for few hours. Action camera is also made to be stronger than normal video camera, so that it keeps filming even when the wearing person moves at high speed or crashes into something.

Camera sellers usually give you a hard clear plastic box that fits with the camera when you buy it. When they do, you should store the camera in this box every time you are going to film something. This box will have holes, a belt, or a metal rod which you can use for tying it to a person, or screwing it on an object that person wears (usually a helmet). Some kind of these boxes can stop water from coming into it when closed, so you may use them to film under water without breaking the camera as well.

[[Johnson County War]]

CATEGORIES: 19th century in Wyoming, Benjamin Harrison

The Johnson County War, also known as the War on Powder River and the Wyoming Range War, was a conflict over farmland that took place in Johnson County, Wyoming between 1889 and 1893. The conflicts began when cattle companies started ruthlessly persecuting alleged rustlers in the area, many of whom were innocent settlers that competed with them for land, livestock and water rights. As tensions swelled between the large established ranchers and the smaller settlers in the state, violence finally culminated in Powder River Country, when the ranchers hired armed gunmen to invade the county. The gunmen's initial incursion in the territory aroused the small farmers and ranchers, as well as the state lawmen, and they formed a posse of 200 men that led to a grueling stand-off. The siege ended when the United States Cavalry on the orders of President Benjamin Harrison relieved the two forces, although further fighting persisted in the following months.

The events have since become a highly mythologized and symbolic story of the Wild West, and over the years variations of the storyline have come to include some of its most famous historical figures. In addition to being one of the most well-known range wars of the American frontier, its themes, especially class warfare, served as a basis for numerous popular novels, films, and television shows in the Western genre.

[[Khoisan]]

CATEGORIES: South African people

The Khoisan is the name for two peoples of Southern Africa: the San and the Khoikhoi. The San are foraging bushmen, and the Khoi are a pastoral people previously known as the Hottentots. The relationship between the two groups is not very clear. The San are generally smaller than other humans in the area. They also look very different than other groups of people there. As of 2018, between 90.000 and 100.000 San are left.  Most of them live in Botswana and Namibia. There are San minorities in South Africa, Angola, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

The San were some of the original (indigenous) inhabitants of Southern Africa. Then the southward Bantu migrations from North and East Africa reached the region 700 years ago.January 2018 The Bantu populations displaced the Khoi and San to become the predominant inhabitants of Southern Africa.

The Khoisan “was the largest population on Earth at some point”, according to one evolutionary geneticist. The evidence of the Khoisan's original presence in South Africa is the distribution of their languages today. Khoisan language groups often have extreme differences in structure and vocabulary despite close proximity, which demonstrates a long period of settlement and co-evolution of languages in the same region.

Charles Darwin wrote about the Khoisan and sexual selection in The Descent of Man in 1882, commenting that their steatopygia evolved through sexual selection in human evolution, and that "the posterior part of the body projects in a most wonderful manner".

In the 1990s, genomic studies of the world's peoples found that the Y chromosome of San men share patterns of polymorphisms that are different from those of all other populations. Because the Y chromosome changes little, this type of DNA test is used to determine when different human subgroups separated from one another. This shows their last common ancestry. The authors of these studies suggest that the San may have been one of the first populations to differentiate from the most recent common ancestor of all living humans, estimated to have lived 60,000 to 90,000 years ago.

[[Persistence hunting]]

CATEGORIES: Hunting

Persistence hunting is important because it is thought to have been important in earlier human societies. It is practiced today by the San people and by the Rarámari (Tarahumara) people of northwest Mexico.

Many animals on grassland move faster than humans. However, humans have endurance and can jog-trot for long distances. Their loss of hair allows them to sweat easily, and their spears give them a way to kill prey at the end of the hunting. 

A group of about four men start out on a search. Finding a suitable antelope, they move towards it, and the animal runs away. They check the signs, such as broken blades of grass, and follow it more slowly, but persistently. Eventually the animal has to stop to eat grass. Grass has so little nutrient that continual eating during the day is essential for their survival. If the antelope runs off into the far distance, one of the younger men is chosen to run after it while the others jog along behind. The runner comes back to say where the animal has gone. In this way younger members with endurance and older men with experience have their roles in the hunt. Eventually the men catch up while the animal can run no further without digesting grass (which is its 'fuel').

There is an alternative explanation as to why the animal eventually stops running, and that relates to its lesser ability to reduce its temperature by sweating, because its coat of fur is so much denser than the human hair covering. This may indeed play a part, but primarily the cause of fatigue is what is called 'metabolic fatigue', such as the shortage of fuel within the muscles.

The San people and their hunting methods were presented on television by David Attenborough in the documentary The Life of Mammals, Program 10 Food for thought. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=826HMLoiE_o

[[Ryakuji]]

CATEGORIES: Japanese language, Writing systems

Ryakuji (kanji:略字, kana:りゃくじ) are shorthand and usually unofficial forms of kanji. 

For example, 々 is a shorthand form of the kanji 仝, which itself is another form of the kanji 同, which means "same". For compound words where the same kanji is used twice in a row, 々 is used where the second kanji would be so that it doesn't have to be written again. 

For example, the word tokidoki, which means "from time to time", uses the same kanji for "time" twice, but is written as 時々 instead of 時時 because Japanese would see the second compound as redundant. So 々 implies that the second character is the same as the first.

Other same character compounds include:

This is similar to English ligatures, or letters that combine to make a new letter or symbol such as &, which was a combination of the letters that make the Latin word "et".

[[Bicycle path]]

CATEGORIES: Cycling

A bicycle path is a way marked for people on bicycles to use.  

Many bicycle path networks can be found in countries such as Denmark or Netherlands, which has had a national system of cycle routes since 1993. These networks may use routes dedicated exclusively to cycle traffic or minor rural roads whose use is otherwise restricted to local motor traffic and agricultural machinery. A safe way to go on a bicycle is when you have a bicycle path. These are made in places where bicycle safety is given consideration, so you do not have to cycle in busy traffic on dangerous roads

The Dutch word Fietspad means Bicycle Path in English. In the Netherlands you can go on the bicycle path to the shops, housing, stations, schools, and workplaces. 

The more sensible approach is based on efforts to increase Utility cycling. In countries like Denmark, the Netherlands and Germany the high levels of utility cycling also includes shopping trips e.g. 9% of all shopping trips in Germany are by bicycle.
