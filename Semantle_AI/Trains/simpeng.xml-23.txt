[[Threatened species]]

CATEGORIES: Threatened species

Threatened species are any species (including animals, plants, and fungi) which might soon become extinct.

The World Conservation Union (IUCN) are the experts on threatened species. They put threatened species into three groups, each group in more danger than the next: 

One way scientists can work out how threatened a species is, is to measure the birth and death rates. If a species becomes small in numbers, it can get to a critical point. This happens when there are not enough individuals left alive to continue the species (critical depensation).

Species that are not a threatened species, but are still a concern, can be put into groups of Near Threatened, Least Concern, and Conservation Dependent. Conservation dependent is no longer used a group. When the species has not been studied, Not Evaluated, or there is not enough information, Data Deficient, the IUCN does not put them on the threatened species list.

Threatened species are also called "red listed" species, because they are in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

[[Stamp Act]]

CATEGORIES: Taxation, Legislation

A stamp act is a law that puts a tax on the transfer of some documents. Those that pay the tax get an official stamp on their documents. Many products have been covered by stamp acts such as playing cards, patent medicines, cheques, mortgages, contracts and newspapers.  The items often have to be physically stamped at approved government offices following payment of the duty, although other methods with annual payment of a fixed sum or purchase of adhesive stamps are more practical and common. Stamp acts have been made common in many countries, like Australia, China, Canada, Ireland, Malaysia, Israel, the United Kingdom and the United States.

The money raised by the tax, called stamp duty, was first used in the Netherlands in 1624 after a public competition to find a new form of tax.  However, it has more been used in Great Britain and its colonies.

The Stamp Act passed by the British Parliament on March 22, 1765 was upsetting to some American colonists.

[[Carbon copy]]

CATEGORIES: E-mail

Carbon Copy is produced when a sheet of carbon paper is placed between two sheets of writing paper.  As a pen, pencil, or typerwriter element presses down to write on the first sheet, exactly the same writing appears on the second sheet.  The same is true if the two sheets of paper and carbon paper are placed into a typerwriter to generate two copies of a document. People would type "cc" at the bottom of the paper to show where the carbon copy was sent. When people began using email, the carbon copy (cc) shows that the same email is sent to more than one person.

[[Ardipithecus]]

CATEGORIES: Australopithecines

Ardipithecus is a very early hominid genus, which lived during the late Neogene.

Two species are known: A. kadabba, dated to about 5.6 million years ago (late Miocene), and A. ramidus, which lived about 4.4 million years ago during the early Pliocene. 

Because this genus shares several traits with the African great ape genera (Pan and Gorilla), some place it on the that branch rather than human branch. 

Most consider it a proto-human because of a likeness in teeth with Australopithecus. Ardipithecus had bipedalism and reduced canines, like the Australopithecines.

[[Australopithecus anamensis]]

CATEGORIES: Australopithecines

Australopithecus anamensis is a species of Australopithecus. The first fossilized specimen of the species, though not recognized as such at the time, was a single arm bone found in Pliocene strata in the Kanapoi region of East Lake Turkana by a Harvard University research team in 1965. The specimen was tentatively assigned at the time to Australopithecus and dated about four million years old. Little additional information was uncovered until 1987, when Canadian archaeologist Allan Morton (with Harvard University's Koobi Fora Field School) discovered fragments of a specimen sticking out of a partially eroded hillside east of Allia Bay, near Lake Turkana, Kenya. 

Six years later the London-born Kenyan paleoanthropologist Meave Leakey and archaeologist Alan Walker excavated the Allia Bay site and uncovered several additional fragments of the hominid, including one complete lower jaw bone which closely resembles that of a common chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) but whose teeth are much more similar to those of a human. In 1995, Meave Leakey and her associates, taking note of differences between Australopithecus afarensis and the new finds, assigned them to a new species, A. anamensis, deriving its name from the Turkana word anam, meaning "lake".

[[Thurgood Marshall]]

CATEGORIES: 1908 births, 1993 deaths, Deaths from heart failure, Politicians from Baltimore, Maryland, Writers from Baltimore, Maryland, United States Solicitors General, United States Supreme Court justices

Thurgood Marshall (July 2, 1908 – January 24, 1993) was an American jurist and the first African American to serve on the Supreme Court of the United States.  Thurgood Marshall, earlier named Thoroughgood Marshall (which he changed in the 2nd grade), was born in Baltimore, Maryland.  Marshall served on the Court from 1967 to 1991. In 1946 he was awarded the Springarn Medal for all his achievements and hard work for the NAACP.  Marshall had been one of the NAACP's top lawyers.  He was one of the lawyers who argued Brown v. Board of Education.  He was also Solicitor General of the United States.

Thurgood Marshall attended Frederick Douglass High School in Baltimore, Maryland and was in the class with the brightest students. He graduated a year early in 1925 with a B-grade average, and was in the top three of his class. In 1929 He married Vivian Burey . He went on to attend  Lincoln University and graduated in 1930. He applied to the University of Maryland Law School, but was denied admission because he was black. He later joined the NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) and became an active member. In 1934, Marshall became director of the NAACP, Legal Defense and for an Educational Fund. He won his first major civil rights case in Maryland in 1935 with the help of Charles Houston. He won 29 of 32 Supreme Court cases. He went on to argue thirty-two cases before the Supreme Court in 1940. Marshall argued in the Smith v. Allwright which disputed the Texan government preventing the rights of black people from voting in 1944. He also fought in the Brown vs. Board of Education of Topeka about racial segregation in public schools in 1948, which was one of the biggest cases of the century. In 1954 the Supreme Court ended racial segregation in public schools. This was a rule violation of the 14th Amendment. It made way for integration and was a major victory of the civil rights movement. He then went on to investigate U.S. Army courts-martial in 1950-1951, in Japan and Korea to help African American soldiers. In 1961 John F. Kennedy appointed him to the US Court of Appeals and he won 29 cases before attending the Supreme Court.

Between the years 1908-1993, he fought for individual rights. A quote that he wrote himself  “A child born to a black mother in a state like Mississippi….. has the same rights as a white boy born to the wealthiest person the United States. It’s not true, but I challenge anyone to say it is not a goal worth working for..” Marshall believed that both blacks and whites should have equal rights but it was not happening in the United States. He thought it was right for both rich and poor children to have equal rights. This quote had to do with Thurgood Marshall’s life because he was not rich but his parents and teachers worked hard to help him become a lawyer. He had to memorize the constitution. As a lawyer, he fought to end segregation between blacks and whites.

Thurgood Marshall was against the death penalty because he didn't think that it was necessary. He argued that there is no reason for the people who did something wrong, to go through the death penalty. He says that they should have a less painful punishment by going to prison instead. In 1990, Marshall said a lot of things about the death penalty and why he didn't want it enforced.  

Back in Thurgood Marshall's time, the time of segregation, some thought that if people were more open they would have seen the most important black male of the century. He joined the NAACP and argued in Brown v Board. To this day there is only one other black male in the Supreme Court justice. In his time in the Supreme Court he worked to end segregation and fought for the equal rights for all people. Even though he’s dead, his legacy is still alive.

In World War II, the Battle of France, also called the Fall of France, was the German invasion of France and the Low Countries from 10 May 1940 that ended the Phoney War. The battle was made up of two parts.

In the first part, called Fall Gelb in German (called Case Yellow in English), German tank units pushed through the Ardennes to circle the Allied units that moved into Belgium.  Most of the British Expeditionary Force and many French soldiers escaped to England from Dunkirk during Operation Dynamo.

The second part of the battle, called Fall Rot in German (Case Red in English), started on 5 June, when German armed forces circled the Maginot Line to attack the rest of France. Italy started its own invasion of southeastern France on 10 June. The French government left Paris for Bordeaux, and the Germans took Paris on 14 June. After the French Second Army Group surrendered on 22 June, France signed an armistice on 25 June.

The battle was a major victory for the Axis Powers.

The French Third Republic ended. France was split into a German-occupied part in the north and west, a small Italian-occupied part in the southeast and a satellite state part in the south that was called Vichy France. Southern France was taken over by Germany on 10 November 1942 until after the Allied return in 1944. The Low Countries freed in 1944 and 1945.

[[Pandora]]

CATEGORIES: People in Greek mythology, Creation myths

In Greek mythology, Pandora was the first mortal woman. According to Hesiod, each god helped create her by giving her unique gifts. Zeus ordered Hephaestus to mould her out of Earth. This was part of the punishment of mankind, because Prometheus had stolen  the secret of fire. All the gods helped by giving her seductive gifts.  Another name was found for her was Anesidora, she who sends gifts. This name was found inscribed against her figure on a white-ground kylix in the British Museum.

According to the myth, Pandora opened a jar (pithos) and released all the evils of mankind. With the exception of plagues and diseases, Hesiod does not specify the evils in detail. When Pandora closed the jar again, only Hope was left inside. The word pithos has been translated the wrong way, which may have led to the idea of "Pandora's box". Pandora opened the jar because she was curious what was inside, and not because of malice.

The myth of Pandora is ancient, and there are several different Greek versions. It has been interpreted in different ways. In the literary versions, the myth is a kind of theodicy, it addresses the question why there is evil in the world. The oldest versiion is that of Hesiod, who wrote it in the 7th century BC. He shortly mentions it in his Theogony, in line 570, but does not name Pandora. In his Works and Days he gives the oldest known literary version of the story. There is an older story that tells that urns and jars can contain blessings and evils which is told in Homer's Illiad:

Usually, curry trees grow to 4-6 metres tall, and their trunk grows to 40 centimetres in diameter. Small black, shiny berries that grow on the tree can be eaten, but their seeds are poisonous.

The scientific name of the curry tree, Murraya koenegii, was chosen to celebrate the botanist Johann Gerhard König, who worked for a long time in India.

[[Native (ecology)]]

CATEGORIES: Ecology

A species is called indigenous or native to a place when that species lives there because of the natural environment, not human change. A species is an indigen if it lives in the wild and has not had artificial selection by humans. 

If a species is in a place because it was moved by humans, the species is not indigenous to that place. It is an introduced species.

[[Quicksand]]

CATEGORIES: Geology

Quicksand is a mixture of water and sand or silt. It has the characteristic of thixotropy: it looks solid, but when pressure is applied it liquifies (acts like a liquid). If animals or people stand on it, they sink into it. However, a person does not drown in quicksand. A human or animal does not sink entirely into quicksand due to the higher density of the fluid. It can be difficult to get out: that is the real problem. Quicksand may be escaped by slow movement of the legs in order to reduce viscosity of the fluid, and rotating the body so as to float on one's back (supine).

Water circulation underground can focus in an area with just the right mixture of fine sands and other materials such as clay.  The water moves up and then down slowly in a convection-like manner throughout a column of sand, and the sand remains a generally solid mass.  This lubricates the sand particles and makes them unable to support any significant weight, since they move around with very little friction. They behave more like a liquid when exposed to stress.  Since the water does not usually go all the way up through the sand, the sand above does not appear to move at all, and can support leaves and other small debris. This makes it difficult to distinguish quicksand from the surrounding environment. 

[[Military organization]]

CATEGORIES: Military

A military organization is a way of making up the armed forces of a state as a need to offer military capability as needed by a national defence policy. In some countries paramilitary forces are included in a nation's armed forces.

CATEGORIES: Atlantic hurricane seasons, 1984

The 1984 Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 1, 1984 and ended on November 30, 1984. Sometimes storms form outside these dates for example. An example of this is Hurricane Lili, which formed on December 12. Lili lasted until December 24.

This season was active, with 17 depression, 13 of them became a tropical storm, 5 of the tropical storms became hurricanes, and 1 of the hurricanes became a major hurricane. Most of the cyclones were weak. The only very damaging storm was Hurricane Diana. Diana was the major hurricane of the season, and the only storm to affect land as a hurricane. 

[[Kenyanthropus platyops]]

CATEGORIES: Australopithecines

Kenyanthropus platyops is an extinct hominid species discovered in Lake Turkana, Kenya in 1999. It was by Justus Erus, who was part of Meave Leakey's team. 

The fossil 3.5 to 3.2 million year old. It has a broad flat face with a toe bone that suggests it probably walked upright. Teeth are intermediate between typical human and typical ape forms.

Leakey proposed that the fossil represents an entirely new hominine genus. Others classify it as a separate species of Australopithecus, Australopithecus platyops, and still others interpret it as an individual of Australopithecus afarensis.

If some palaeoanthropologists are correct, Kenyanthropus may not even represent a valid taxon. The specimen is so distorted by matrix-filled cracks that meaningful morphological characteristics are next to impossible to assess with confidence.

[[Gavotte]]

CATEGORIES: Musical forms

The gavotte was a folk dance, performed by the peasants in the Brittany region of France. Later it was popular in French and English courts in the 17th and 18th centuries. It was especially popular in the French courts of King Louis XIV. 

The music for a gavotte has a four beat feel, with upbeats on beats three and four. To dance a gavotte the dancers must cross their feet twice in each step pattern, with each step followed by a hop. Singers often provided the accompaniment, though dancers might also be accompanied by an ensemble of such instruments as a violin, a drum, bagpipes or shawm, a forerunner of the modern oboe.

The gavotte later became a musical, rather than a dance piece. In the Baroque period gavottes were mainly found in binary form. When composers began writing suites, six short dance based pieces, the gavotte usually was played between the sarabande and the gigue.

[[Quartz clock]]

CATEGORIES: Clocks

A quartz clock is a clock that uses an electronic oscillator that is regulated by a quartz crystal to keep time.  This crystal oscillator creates a signal with very precise frequency, so that quartz clocks are at least an order of magnitude more accurate than good mechanical clocks.  Generally, some form of digital logic counts the cycles of this signal and provides a numeric time display, usually in units of hours, minutes, and seconds.  Since the 1970s, they have become the most widely used timekeeping technology.

[[Homo sapiens idaltu]]

CATEGORIES: Hominins, Prehistoric Africa

Homo sapiens idaltu is an extinct subspecies of Homo sapiens. They lived almost 160,000 years ago in Africa during the Pleistocene period. Idaltu is the Afar word for "elder, first born".

The fossilized remains of H. s. idaltu were discovered in Ethiopia's Afar Triangle in 1997. The region has volcanic layers. By using radiometric dating, the layers date between 154,000 and 160,000 years old. Three well preserved crania (top part of skulls) were discovered, the best preserved being from an adult male (BOU-VP-16/1) with a brain capacity of 1450. 

Later, another even earlier version of Homo sapiens was found  by a team led by Richard Leakey. These remains were from Omo National Park, Ethiopia. A 2005 potassium-argon dating of volcanic tuff associated with the remains showed them to date from about 195,000 years ago, even older than the idaltu fossils. These Omo remains are the earliest known remains of 'anatomically modern humans', that is, modern man. Leakey and his team have not given the remains a subspecific name. They are just called "Omo remains of Homo sapiens".

[[Feud]]

CATEGORIES: Violence

A feud (ˈfjuːd) (also called blood feud or vendetta) is a long-running argument or fight between parties. In most cases it involves whole familles or clans. People are seen as guilty, not because they did something, but because they were seen with other people (who are considered guilty). This is called guilt by association.

Feuds start because one party thinks they were attacked, insulted, or otherwise harmed by the other party. Intense feelings of resentment trigger the initial revenge, which causes the other party to feel the same way. The dispute is then fueled by a long-running cycle of retaliatory violence. This ongoing cycle of provocation and retaliation makes it very difficult to end the feud peacefully. Feuds frequently involve the original parties' family members and/or associates. They can last for generations.

Up to the early modern period, feuds were considered legitimate legal instruments. The state or ruler even made laws for certain aspects of feuds. Once modern centralizing states asserted and enforced a monopoly on legitimate use of force, feuds became illegal and the concept acquired its current negative connotation.

[[2009 Victorian bushfires]]

CATEGORIES: 2009 disasters, 2000s in Australia, Fires, Victoria, Australia, Natural disasters

The 2009 Victorian bushfires also called Black Saturday, where more than 400 bushfires that started in Victoria, Australia on February 7, 2009. The fires caused Australia's highest ever loss of life from a bushfire. Police say that 173 people died, and 414  people were taken to hospitals with bad burns. At first the death toll was thought to be 210, but forensic tests have shown there were 173 people killed and the death toll was revised.

The fires burnt down at least 2,029 homes, 3,500 buildings in total and damaged thousands. Many towns north-east of the state capital Melbourne were badly damaged or almost completely destroyed, including the Victorian towns of Kinglake,  Marysville,  Narbethong,  Strathewen, and Flowerdale. Many houses in the Victorian towns of Steels Creek, Humevale, Wandong,  St Andrews,  Callignee,  and Koornalla were also destroyed or damaged. There were people killed at each town. The fires affected 78 towns and left about 7,500 people homeless.  More than 4,000 firemen and women worked to control and stop the fires. They were still burning more than two weeks after they started.

Most of the fires started and spread on a day of some of the worst bushfire weather ever recorded. The temperature in Victoria reached 46 degrees Celsius and wind speed was more than 100 km/h. The wind blew the fires over large distances and areas, creating large firestorms. North-east of Melbourne, a single firestorm killed 120 people. A cool change hit the state in the early evening, but it had gale force south-westerly winds of more than 120 km/h. This change in wind direction caused the long eastern sides of the fires to become wide fire fronts that burned quickly towards towns that had earlier escaped the fires.

Many of the fires were started by fallen or clashing power lines or were deliberately lit. There was also lightning, cigarette butts, and sparks from a power tool. A ten-year drought made the land and forests very dry and they burnt quickly. Finally, in early-mid March, the weather changed and the fire fighters were able to put out the fires.

[[RFID]]

CATEGORIES: Computer hardware, Data input

Radio-frequency identification (RFID) is a technology to record the presence of an object using radio signals. It is used for inventory control or timing sporting events. RFID is not a replacement for barcoding, but a complement for distant reading of codes.

The technology is used for automatically identifying a person, a package or an item. To do this, it relies on RFID tags. These are small transponders (combined radio receiver and transmitter) that will transmit identity information over a short distance, when asked. The other piece to make use of RFID tags is an RFID tag reader.

An RFID tag is an object that can be applied to or incorporated into a product, animal, or person for the purpose of identification and tracking using radio waves. Some tags can be read from several meters away and beyond the line of sight of the reader. Most tags carry a plain text inscription and a barcode as complements for direct reading and for cases of any failure of radio frequency electronics.

Most RFID tags contain at least two parts. One is an integrated circuit for storing and processing information, modulating and de-modulating a radio-frequency (RF) signal, and other specialized functions. The second is an antenna for receiving and transmitting the signal.

There are generally two types of RFID tags: active RFID tags, which contain a battery, and passive RFID tags, which have no batteries

[[Steamboat]]

CATEGORIES: Boats

A steamboat (also called a steamship or steamer) is a ship that uses a steam engine or steam turbine to move. At first, these were paddle steamboats. Some had a paddle wheel on the back. Others had two wheels on the sides. Most went down rivers. From about 1836, marine propellers, invented by Josef Ressel, were used. Claude François Jouffroy d’Abbans built the first working steamship in 1783.

There were many steamboats in the 19th century in the United States and other countries. However, the first steamboat was built by John Fitch in 1787. It had many paddles. Fitch tried to make money from the steamboat, but could not do so. He died in 1798, and did not live long enough to see Robert Fulton become the first person to build a steamboat that could make money. In 1807, Fulton built a steamboat that could travel from New York City to Albany in 32 hours. Steamboats became much faster later in the 19th century.

After the middle 19th century paddle steamers became rare, as the marine propeller gave more speed and burned less fuel. The new vessels were suited to the open ocean, and were usually called "steamships". During the 20th century, marine Diesel engines largely replaced steam propulsion.

[[Tragedy of the commons]]

CATEGORIES: Sociology, Metaphors, Property

The tragedy of the commons was an article published by Garrett Hardin in the journal Science in 1968. It describes a problem where many people with their own ideas can make something they all share worse, even if no one wants to. For example, even if no one wants to pollute water because that makes it unhealthy, it can still end up like that because so many want to use the water for their own reasons, like washing and throwing away rubbish. Each person thinks that their small bit of pollution of the water is too small to affect the quality of the water, but because there are many people the total effect ends up making the water too polluted for mostly anybody to use for drinking or even washing. This may occur in slums and other overcrowded places like refugee camps.

The idea was not Hardin's, but a person named William Forster Lloyd who wrote about it in 1833. In those days herders often grazed cows on common land. Lloyd pointed out that each cow added benefit to its owner but damaged the land overall for all herders by overgrazing.

The tragedy of the commons is often used in modern debates on ecology. It is also a topic in game theory.

[[Black smoker]]

CATEGORIES: Oceanography

A black smoker is a kind of hydrothermal vent that can be found on the ocean floor. It is a crack in the planet's surface from which geothermally heated water comes out. Hydrothermal vents are commonly found near volcanically active places, areas where tectonic plates are moving apart, ocean basins, and hotspots.

Hydrothermal vents are common on earth because it is both geologically active and has large amounts of water on its surface and within its crust. Common land types include hot springs, fumaroles and geysers. The most famous hydrothermal vent system on land is probably within Yellowstone National Park in the United States. Under the sea, hydrothermal vents may form features called "black smokers".

Relative to the majority of the deep sea, the areas around submarine hydrothermal vents are biologically more productive, often hosting complex communities fueled by the chemicals dissolved in the vent fluids. Chemosynthetic archaea form the base of the food chain, supporting diverse organisms, including giant tube worms, clams, limpets and shrimp.

Active hydrothermal vents are believed to exist on Jupiter's moon Europa, and ancient hydrothermal vents have been speculated to exist on Mars.

The Republic of Taiwan was a short-lived republic on the island of Taiwan. It is also called in 臺灣民主國; which means "Democratic State of Taiwan". In English it was also called the: Formosan Republic, Taiwan Republic and the Republic of Formosa.

The Republic of Taiwan was formed in 1895. It did not last for very long. The Treaty of Shimonoseki which ended the war between the Qing Dynasty of China and the Empire of Japan, gave Taiwan to the Japanese. The republic began when the Chinese left in May, 1895, and ended when the Japanese soldiers arrived in October, 1896. Some historians say it was the first republic in Asia, but there was one earlier, the Lanfang Republic, which had been started in 1777.

The republic was started by a group of high officials and local people who still supported the Qing. They wanted to stop the Japanese take over of Taiwan. On May 24, 1895 the new republic sent a copy of its declaration of independence to all the embassies on Taiwan. The next day the new government held an independence ceremony. The Republic of Taiwan made their own stamps. They also printed their own paper money, which is now very hard to find.

They were always loyal to the Qing, and said that the Republic would be part of the Qing state. The first president of the Republic of Taiwan was the old governor, Tang Ching-sung, who served from May 25, 1895 to June 5, 1895. The second president was Liu Yung-fu, June 5, 1895 – October 21, 1896.

When the Japanese soldiers invaded Taiwan there was a lot of fighting. They quickly defeated the new republic. Most of the republic's official quickly left the island.

The modern Taiwan independence groups want to start a new Republic of Taiwan. They say that there is no connection between them and the 1895 Republic. The first Republic of Taiwan was loyal to China, but the new Republic of Taiwan would be started to be independent of China.

[[Order theory]]

CATEGORIES: Mathematics

Order theory is a field of mathematics. It concerns itself with being able to compare different elements of a set.

Another way to say this is to say that one of the two is "smaller than" the other.

For a specific set to be ordered it must be:

reflexive: each element of the set is within a relation with itself.

anti-symmetric: if A and B are in relation, and B is also in a relation with A, then A must be equal to B.

transitive: if A and B in a relation, and B is in a relation with C, then A and C must be in a relation.

[[Fire-stick farming]]

CATEGORIES: Indigenous Australian culture, Agriculture in Australia

Fire-stick farming are words used by Australian archaeologist Rhys Jones in 1969. They describe the way that Indigenous Australians used fire regularly to burn the land. This helped hunting by herding the animals into particular areas, and also caused new grass to grow which attracted more animals. Over many years it changed the types of plants and animals that lived in an area.

Fire-stick farming had turned scrub into grassland, which increased the numbers of grass eating animals such as the kangaroo. Scientists say that the changes caused by fire-stick farming caused the extinction of the Australian megafauna.

In the forests, fire-stick farming opened up clear areas and let more plants grow at ground level. This increased the number of animals that could feed on these plants, such as the herbivore marsupials.

[[Miocene]]

CATEGORIES: Cainozoic, Miocene

The Miocene is the first epoch of the Neogene period and the fourth of the Cainozoic. It started about 23 million years ago and ended about 5.33 million years ago. The rock beds that mark the start and end are well known, but the exact dates of the start and end of the period are uncertain. The biota becomes 'modern'.

The Miocene was named by Sir Charles Lyell. Its name comes from the Greek words μείων (meiōn, “less”) and καινός (kainos, “new”) and means "less recent", because it has 18% fewer modern sea invertebrates than the Pliocene.

As the earth cooled, it went from the Oligocene epoch, through the Miocene, and into the Pliocene. The Miocene boundaries are not set at any particular world wide event. They are set at regional boundaries between the warmer Oligocene and the cooler Pliocene epochs.

The plants and animals of the Miocene were fairly modern, but familiar present-day species had not yet evolve. Modern families of mammals and birds existed. Whales, seals, and kelp spread. Modern sharks appeared, including the huge Megalodon. Grasslands became more common. Mammalian browsers became less common, and grazer species became more common. About 100 species of ape lived at that time, and cetaceans were very common in the seas. The giganic shark Carcharodon megalodon may have preyed on them.

[[Asterales]]

What looks like its flower is really made of  hundreds or thousands of tiny individual flowers. The technical term for it is a pseudanthium ("false flower"). 

The driving force for the evolution of the Asteraceae was that the composite flowers look attractive to pollinating insects. A large brightly coloured flower attracts insects. The other quality insects like is the scent of the pollen and the sugary nectar in the flowers. The asters are very successful (over 32,000 known species of flowering plants in over 1,900 genera in the order Asterales). Their success is due to what they offer to visiting insects. It is also due to their ability to grow almost anywhere, but especially on grass.

Heterocarpy, or amphicarpy, the ability of an annual species to produce different fruit morphs, is common in Asteraceae. It allows seeds to be dispersed over varying distances, each type adapted to different environment. This increases the chances of survival.

Taupe refers to a dark grayish-brown color.  The word "taupe" derives from the Latin name for the European Mole, Talpa europaea. 

Originally, this referred only to the average color of the French mole, but like the colors pink and lavender, the name expanded (in the case of taupe beginning in the 1940s) to encompass a wide range of varying shades.  It seems that this occurred because the color of the fur of the mole can itself be a wide range of shades, from gray through yellowish, brownish, and even purplish.

The first use of taupe as a color name in English was in the early 1800s (exact year is not known).

[[Passive solar building design]]

CATEGORIES: Energy

In passive solar building design, windows, walls, and floors are made to collect, store, and distribute solar energy in the form of heat in the winter and reject solar heat in the summer. This is called passive solar design or climatic design because, unlike active solar heating systems, it doesn't involve

the use of mechanical and electrical devices.

The key to designing a passive solar home is to best take advantage of the local climate. Elements to be considered include window placement and glazing type, thermal insulation, thermal mass, and shading.  Passive solar design techniques can be applied most easily to new buildings, but existing buildings can be adapted or "retrofitted".

[[Yom Kippur War]]

The Yom Kippur War (also known as the Ramadan War and the October War) was a war between Israel with support from USA and Egypt and Syria with support the other Arab countries (Limited arms and weaponry). The war took place from October 6-24, 1973. The war began on the Jewish day of repentance of Yom Kippur in 1973, and it happened during the Muslim month of Ramadan. The attack by Egypt and Syria was a surprise to Israel after Israel conquered the Sinai peninsula and the Golan Heights from Egypt in 1967. Egypt's army entered the Sinai Peninsula to retrieve their land from Israel.

The Sinai and the Golan Heights previously belonged to Egypt and Syria, but they were occupied by Israel since 1967 during the Six Day War. Syria's aim of the war was to liberate all of the Golan Heights.

During the first few days of the war, Egypt and Syria scored astounding victories. Israel was shocked by the attack and was on the verge of defeat. The first Israeli counterattacks failed against both Egypt and Syria. However, Israeli attacks later repelled the Syrian forces and pushed them back further into Syria. The Iraqi army joined the war with Syria and the Israeli army stopped advancing.

On the Egyptian front, Israel's attacks against Syria had served as a 'distraction' against the Egyptian offense. This allowed the Egyptian army to dig deeper into Sinai, around 12 km, an extra 2 km to the original 10 km plan. Israel feared a massive military defeat and so called on America for aid. Initially, America refused so Israel threatened to use its nuclear weapons, this threat was enough to persuade President Richard Nixon to send aid to Israel. America conducted Operation Nickel Grass, which gave Israel a resupply of 20 tons of military equipment and ammunition. This vital to Israel and it allowed Israel to continue fighting . Henry Kissinger, However, this was later denied.

The Egyptian army crossed the Suez Canal on October 6 and destroyed the Israeli defenses and forts on the other side of the canal. Israel tried for the next few days to defeat the Egyptians and push them back behind the canal. However the Israelis could not push them back. The United States of America started sending ammunition and weapons to Israel using airplanes to help the Israeli army win the war in Operation Nickel Grass. Syria soon pleaded Egypt to attack Israel to lessen the pressure on it. On October 14, Egypt attacked again, trying to advance even more into the Sinai. Israel defeated the attack, and the Egyptians lost about 250 tanks. After this, the Israelis attacked again.  After heavy fighting, they crossed the canal at its center, between two Egyptian armies. They advanced north and south. They kept moving south until the reached the city of Suez, and they trapped a large Egyptian force on the eastern side of the canal, in the Sinai. The Israelis tried to capture Suez, but they were defeated. They also failed to advance north. They reached an area 101 kilometers from Cairo, the capital of Egypt.

On October 15, The Battle of the Chinese Farm took place, it is regarded as one of the deadliest and longest tank battles since World War II,  After the battle had ended, Dayan would recount that: "I am no novice at war or battle scenes, but I have never seen such a sight, not in reality, or in paintings, or in the worst war movies. Here was a vast field of slaughter stretching as far as the eye could see." Sharon would also provide his own poignant account of the aftermath: "It was as if a hand-to-hand battle of armor had taken place... Coming close you could see the Egyptian and Jewish dead lying side-by-side, soldiers who had jumped from their burning tanks and died together. Soldiers who never surrendered. No picture could capture the horror of the scene, none could encompass what had happened there."

The losses suffered by both the Egyptians and the Israelis in the battle were severe. Israeli units suffered heavy casualties in men and equipment; Reshef's armored losses during the first night of the battle alone were comparable to Egyptian armored losses on the disastrous October 14 offensive. For their part, the numbers of Egyptian armored forces within 16th Division's bridgehead severely dwindled. As of 18 October the 21st Armored Division had no more than 40 tanks remaining of an original 136 tanks available at the start of the battle (not counting 21 tanks received as reinforcements), while the 16th Infantry Division had just 20 tanks remaining in its organic tank battalion. This attrition served Egypt's war strategy of inflicting maximum casualties on the Israelis, even though, from another perspective, the initiative had passed to the Israelis during the battle. It was a Military defeat for Egypt and Moral victory for Egypt, on the Israeli side it was a Military victory but a severe Moral defeat and humiliation. 

The United Nations passed a resolution in the security council that asked all the countries to bring a temporary stop to the war (called a 'ceasefire'). The Arab countries and Israel agreed. However the ceasefire failed when the Israeli army advanced south to reach Suez. After this, the Soviet leader, Leonid Brezhnev, said to the US president that if the US did not send troops that he would send Soviet troops to the area. This was believed to be a threat and the United States put their military on full nuclear alert. Because of this tension between the United States and the Soviets, Israel agreed to a ceasefire, and the war ended. It was the closest the two superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union, had been to nuclear war since the Cuban Missile Crisis of the 1960s.

[[Newton's method]]

CATEGORIES: Functions and mappings

Newton's method provides a way for finding the real zeros of a function. This algorithm is sometimes called the Newton–Raphson method, named after Sir Isaac Newton and Joseph Raphson.

The method uses the derivative of the function in order to find its roots. An initial "guess value" for the location of the zero must be made. From this value, a new guess is calculated by this formula:

Here xn is the initial guess and xn+1 is the next guess. The function f (whose zero is being solved for) has the derivative f'.

By repeatedly applying this formula to the generated guesses (that is by setting the value of xn to the formula's output and recomputing), the value of the guesses will approach a zero of the function.

Newton's method can be explained graphically by looking at intersections of tangent lines with the x-axis. First, a line tangent to the f at xn is calculated. Next, the intersection between this tangent line and the x-axis is found. Finally, the x-position of this intersection is recorded as the next guess, xn+1.

Its height was 130 centimeters (4 feet 3 inches) and weight 54 kilograms (119 pounds). Asimo was just like an astronaut wearing a backpack and could walk or run on two feet. 

[[Fahrenheit 451]]

CATEGORIES: 1953 books, 20th century American novels, English-language novels, Fantasy books, Fiction set in the future, Hugo_Award_winners, Science fiction books

Fahrenheit 451 is an American dystopian fiction novel. It was written by Ray Bradbury and first published in 1953.

The novel is about a future American society in which people are hedonistic (meaning they live only for pleasure), and reading is against the law because it makes them think. The main character, Guy Montag, has a job as a "fireman" (which, in this future, means "book burner"). The number "451" refers to the temperature (in Fahrenheit) at which the books burn when the "firemen" burn them "for the good of humanity". Written in the early years of the Cold War, the novel is a critique of what Bradbury saw as an increasingly dysfunctional American society.

The idea began with Bradbury's short story "Bright Phoenix," written in 1947 but first published in the Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction in 1963. The original short story was reworked into the novella, The Fireman, and published in the February 1951 issue of Galaxy Science Fiction. The novel was also serialized in the March, April, and May 1954 issues of Playboy magazine. Bradbury wrote the entire novel on a pay typewriter in the basement of UCLA's Powell library. His original idea in writing Fahrenheit 451 was to show his great love for books and libraries. He has often referred to Montag as an allusion to himself.

Over the years, the novel has been subject to various interpretations, primarily focusing on the historical role of book burning in suppressing dissenting ideas. Bradbury has said that the novel is not about censorship; he says that Fahrenheit 451 is a story about how television destroys interest in reading literature, which leads to people thinking that knowledge is made up of "factoids", partial information without context, such as Napoleon's birth date alone, without an indication of who he was.

A movie version of the novel was released in 1966, and at least two BBC Radio 4 dramatizations have also been aired, both of which follow the book very closely.

[[Stack (data structure)]]

CATEGORIES: Computer science, Data structures

The stack is one of the most important data structures in computer science. To understand how a stack works, think of a deck of playing cards that is face down. We can only easily access the card that is on top. When we want to look at the top card, there are two things we can do: we can peek at it, but leave it on the stack, or we can pop it off. When we pop off the top object, we are taking it off the stack. If we want to add another card to the top of the stack, we push. 

A stack is called a last-in-first-out (LIFO) collection. This means that the last thing we added (pushed) is the first thing that gets pulled (popped) off. If the last card we put on our stack of cards was an ace, then the first card we pulled from the top is that same ace.

[[Nocturnal emission]]

CATEGORIES: Sleep

A nocturnal emission or "wet dream" is when a person (man or woman) has an orgasm while sleeping. Wet dreams can begin after a person goes through puberty. Many young people have their first orgasm this way. They might not understand what has happened to them, if they have not been taught anything about sex.

Nocturnal emissions are called wet dreams in males because of the dampness caused by ejaculation and because the orgasm and ejaculation often happen during a sexually exciting dream. Scientists are not sure what causes them. Most sexual dreams do not cause orgasms.

It is harder for women to tell, because vaginal lubrication is not always associated with orgasm.

Wet dreams are natural and harmless. They do not mean that anything is wrong with you. Many people stop having wet dreams if they masturbate often, or once they begin having sexual intercourse on a regular basis.

If you urinate while asleep, this is called wetting the bed, not a wet dream.

[[Tevatron]]

CATEGORIES: Nuclear physics, Fermilab

The Tevatron was a giant Particle accelerator in Illinois that was used by scientists to make protons go very fast, almost the speed of light in some cases. Scientists looked at what happens when the protons hit antiprotons to see if they are right about their ideas as to what protons are made of.

The Tevatron was a circular particle accelerator at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (also known as Fermilab), just east of Batavia, Illinois. It was the second highest energy particle collider in the world after the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The Tevatron is a synchrotron that accelerates protons and antiprotons in a 6.28 km (3.90 miles) ring to energies of up to 1 TeV, hence its name. The Tevatron was completed in 1983 at a cost of $120 million ($US todayUS) and has been regularly upgraded since then. (The 'Energy Doubler', as it was known then, produced its first accelerated beam — 512 GeV —  on July 3, 1983.)  The Main Injector was the most substantial addition, built over five years from 1994 at a cost of $290 million.  The Tevatron was shut down on September 30, 2011.

The Large Hadron Collider was later built in Switzerland to look for one of those pieces, called the Higgs Boson. The LHC broke and is now being fixed. The Tevatron scientists also tried to find the Higgs Boson. They need to do this before the LHC is fixed, because the LHC is much better at finding things.

The scientists at the Tevatron had a year's headstart on the scientists at the LHC. Whoever finds the Higgs will be honored by other scientists. That is why the scientists at the Tevatron wanted to find it before the scientists at the LHC.

The Tevatron discovered three of the 17 fundamental particles including the top quark.  The main ring of the Tevatron will probably be reused in future experiments, and its components may be transferred to other particle accelerators.

[[MOSFET]]

CATEGORIES: Electronic components

A MOSFET is an electronic component that acts as an electrically-controlled switch. 

MOSFET stands for metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor. Transistors are small electrical devices that are used in, amongst other things, alarm clocks, calculators, and, perhaps most famously, computers; they are some of the most basic building blocks of modern electronics. A few MOSFETs amplify or process analog signals. Most are used in digital electronics.

MOSFETs act like valves for electricity. They have one input connection (the "gate") which is used to control the flow of electricity between two other connections (the "source" and "drain"). Said another way, the gate acts as a switch that controls the two outputs. Think of a dimmable light switch: the knob itself selects 'ON', 'OFF', or somewhere in between, controlling the brightness of the light. Think of a MOSFET in place of the light switch: the switch itself is the "gate", the "source" is the power coming into the house, and the "drain" is the light bulb.

The name MOSFET describes the structure and the function of the transistor. MOS refers to the fact that a MOSFET is built by layering metal (the "gate") on oxide (an insulator which prevents the flow of electricity) on semiconductor (the "source" and "drain"). FET describes the action of the gate on the semiconductor.  An electric signal is sent to the gate, which creates an electric field that alters the connection between the "source" and "drain".

Almost all MOSFETs are used in integrated circuits. As of 2008, it is possible to fit 2,000,000,000 transistors on a single integrated circuit. In 1970, that number was around 2,000.

[[First Punic War]]

CATEGORIES: 264 BC, Punic Wars, Wars and battles of Ancient Rome

The First Punic War started in 264 BC. It lasted for 23 years, ending in 241 BC. It was the first of three wars fought between ancient Carthage and the Roman Republic. They were rivals for trade and influence in the Mediterranean. For more than 20 years the two powers struggled for supremacy. Key areas were the island of Sicily and its surrounding waters, and also North Africa. Rome eventually won control of Sicily.

With the help of her own allies and rebels among the indigenous African allies of Carthage, Rome won the First Punic War after 23 years. In the end it became the dominant naval power of the Mediterranean. To get terms for peace, the Carthaginians had to pay a large amount of money (in silver), and give up a number of islands in the Mediterranean. They kept Sardinia and Corsica.

[[Trade paperback (comics)]]

CATEGORIES: Comics

 Trade paperbacks, or "trades" as they are commonly called, are collections of comic books that are usually bound in a better format than the comic magazines, using the same materials and methods as printed books. They are generally sold in bookstores and specialty comic book shops rather than at newsstands. 

Unlike graphic novels, the material in a trade paperback is reprinted from comic magazines that were released in the standard 32-page format. Unlike comic books, which only tell one small part of a story, trade paperbacks usually collect a complete story, story arc, or a large part of a story. They usually reprint the material from 4 to 12 comic books, depending on the size of the trade and the story being collected.

Some famous examples of trade paperbacks:

[[Mathematical induction]]

CATEGORIES: Mathematics

Mathematical induction is a special way of proving a mathematical truth. It can be used to prove that something is true for all the natural numbers (or all positive numbers from a point onwards). The idea is that if: 

then

In the careful language of mathematics, a proof by induction often proceeds as follows:

Because it is true for 1, then it is true for 1+1 (=2, by the induction step), then it is true for 2+1 (=3), then it is true for 3+1 (=4), and so on. 

An example of proof by induction is the following:

Prove that for all natural numbers n:

Proof: 

First, the statement can be written as:

By induction on n,

First, for n=1:

so this is true.

Next, assume that for some n=n0 the statement is true. That is,:

Then for n=n0+1:

can be rewritten as 

Hence the proof is complete by induction.

[[Polymerization]]

CATEGORIES: Polymer chemistry

Polymerization or polymerisation is the process in which small molecules, called monomers, join chemically to produce a very large chain-like or network molecules, called a polymer. The monomer molecules may all be alike, or they may represent two, three, or more different compounds. Usually at least 100 monomer molecules must be combined to make a product that has certain unique physical properties—such as elasticity, high tensile strength, or the ability to form fibres—that differentiate polymers from substances composed of smaller and simpler molecules. Often, many thousands of monomer units are incorporated in a single molecule of a polymer. The formation of stable covalent chemical bonds between the monomers sets polymerization apart from other processes, such as crystallization, in which large numbers of molecules aggregate under the influence of weak intermolecular forces.

Alkene molecules can react with themselves, by adding polymerization to form 'plastic' or polymeric materials. When a catalyst (a substance that speeds up chemical processes) is added to the reaction, or it is heated under pressure, unsaturated alkenes link together, when the double bond partially breaks.

Uses of polymers: Polyethene- it is a cheap and useful plastic used for plastic bags and bottles, it is also very flexible and quite strong.

Okashina Okashi is hosted on Comic Genesis, a free online provider of webcomics.  Baird used his comics while teaching for Hess Educational Organization, an English education business in the Republic of China and Singapore. He used Okashina Okashi in the Create a Comic Project when he volunteered to teach a free after-school youth literacy library event in New Haven, CT.

In August 2007, Emi-chan added a new comic set in the Beauty Man Garden, a chain of restaurants featured prominently throughout Okashina Okashi. The new comic is called Mini BMG.

[[Adverse possession]]

CATEGORIES: Legal terms, Property

Adverse possession is a rule in property law. This rule says that if property is not being used by its owner while another person is using the property, this other person (called an "adverse possessor") becomes the new owner of the property. To get these rights, the adverse possessor usually must use the property in the way a normal owner would do for a period of time, typically 20 years. In some jurisdictions, a form of adverse possession exists in which the adverse possessor ends up with sharing some rights to property with the owner, such as a right-of-way, instead of getting all the rights.

[[Rule against perpetuities]]

CATEGORIES: Property

The Rule against Perpetuities is one of the most complicated rules in property law and wills and trusts.  In general, the rule states that a gift of a will (or a trust) will not be enforced if the subject of the gift is to be given to a person who can not be known now, and will not be able to be known, by the end of 21 years after the death of everyone who was alive (including children in their mother's uterus but not yet born) at the time the gift was created.  

For example, if a woman says in her will that her house is to be given "to the children of her children when they graduate from college" this would not be enforced by a court. It would not be enforced because one (or more) of her children's children might not graduate from college until 21 years after everyone who was alive at the time of the woman's death has died.  

The purpose of the rule is to prevent property from being tied up for "perpetuity" (a very long time).  The courts (and many people in society) do not want to hold property to see who will receive it after a complicated set of rules from the gift-giver. First, this would result in a waste of the courts' time and resources. Second, it would be a waste of the property that is being given through the gift.  If a gift in a will violates the Rule against Perpetuities, the court will simply strike that gift and transfer the subject of the gift as if the will had not mentioned it.

However, many countries and states have changed this rule, and it does not apply at all, or in a changed way, in those countries and states.

[[Polypeptide]]

CATEGORIES: Biochemistry

A polypeptide is a string or linear chain of amino acids linked together. Amino acids are the basic building blocks of proteins.  A single polypeptide chain might make up the entire primary structure of a simple protein; more complex proteins are formed when two or more polypeptides link together. Each protein is a polymer of amino acids.

Polypeptides are made when mRNA is translated, a process involving ribosomes, tRNA and amino acids.

[[Solipsism]]

CATEGORIES: Epistemology, Philosophical movements and positions

Solipsism (pronounced: En-us-ncalif-solipsism.ogg) is the view that a person has no reason to believe anything exists except their own mind. It is a philosophical position that first appeared in ancient philosophy. It mainly means to reject or doubt that other people exist. "Solus" and "ipse" are the Latin words for "alone" and "self", which is where the word "solipsism" comes from. Some kinds of solipsism say that everything outside a person's own mind (including other people) is only imaginary. Other kinds of solipsism instead say that nothing outside a person's own mind is certain.

To only reject that the physical world exists is not solipsism. Solipsism also rejects or doubts that other people exist. As an epistemological position, it is the concept that nothing but one's own mind can be certain to exist. The existence of other minds, in this position, is considered a possibility, but not a certainty. Including time, which does not stop just because there would be nobody being to experience it (which is probably going to happen in the end of the universe when there would be simply nothing)

[[Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit]]

CATEGORIES: United States Air Force aircraft

The Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit, also called the Stealth Bomber, is an American strategic bomber. It has a lot of stealth technology, and it is designed to get through many anti-aircraft defenses. It can drop both conventional and nuclear weapons. Two people fly the bomber, and it can drop up to 80 500-class JDAM GPS-guided bombs, or sixteen 2400 B83 nuclear bombs. 

The bomber began being designed as the "Advanced Technology Bomber" (ATB) during the Carter administration. The designing of the ATB continued during the Reagan administration. The bomber was designed and is made by Northrop Grumman, with help from Boeing. Each aircraft cost US$737 million (in 1997 dollars). 

Because the bomber is very expensive, the project was controversial in the U.S. Congress. The end of the Cold War meant that the bomber was not really needed anymore. Congress wanted to buy 132 bombers, but during the late 1980s and 1990s, Congress reduced this to 21. In 2008, a B-2 was destroyed in a crash shortly after takeoff. The crew got out safely. 20 B-2s are being used by the United States Air Force. 

Although the B-2 was supposed to be a mainly nuclear bomber, it was first used in combat to drop normal bombs on Serbia during the Kosovo War in 1999. It was used during the Iraq War and it is being used in the war in Afghanistan.

[[Diapause]]

CATEGORIES: Physiology

Diapause is a delay in development which has evolved in response to regular periods of adverse environmental conditions.

It is a physiological state with very specific conditions. Diapause is a mechanism used as a means to survive predictable, unfavourable environmental conditions, such as temperature extremes, drought or reduced food availability. It is most often observed in arthropods, especially insects, and in the embryos of many of the oviparous species of fish in the order Cyprinodontiformes.

Not only is diapause started by specific stimuli or conditions, but once it is started, only certain other stimuli are capable of bringing the organism out of diapause. This distinguishes diapause from other forms of dormancy such as hibernation.

Activity levels of diapausing stages can vary considerably among species. Diapause may occur in a completely immobile stage, such as the pupae and eggs, or it may occur in very active stages that undergo extensive migrations, such as the adult Monarch butterfly, Danaus plexippus. In cases where the insect remains active, feeding is reduced and reproductive development is slowed or halted.

[[Electric field]]

CATEGORIES: Electromagnetism

Electric fields are caused by electric charges, described by Gauss's law, or varying magnetic fields, described by Faraday's law of induction.  The equations of both fields are coupled and together form Maxwell's equations that describe both fields as a function of charges and currents. 

[[Audiobook]]

CATEGORIES: Disability, Books

Audiobooks or "talking books" are books that have been read aloud by someone and recorded. Nowadays, they are usually recorded onto compact discs (CDs), although some older editions remain on cassette tapes. (This is why many texts in this format were first called books-on-tape.) More recently, audiobooks have been available to download from the internet (free or paid-for) and pre-recorded on special MP3 players.

While audiobooks can be used by anyone, they serve as a main resource for people who are blind or cannot see well.

Many popular books are often chosen to be turned into audiobooks. The original author may or may not be involved in choosing the narrator for the reading. Some authors often use the same reader for many books, so that their audiobooks have a similar sound or style.

[[Power spectrum]]

CATEGORIES: Electronics

The power spectrum of a signal is the power or more simply the energy of the signal at each frequency that it contains. It can also be considered as the range or spectra of energy or power of the given signal derived from the signals' range of frequencies. For example, white noise, which contains all frequencies at the same power, has a flat power spectrum. The power spectrum of the sound of the bottom key on a piano would have a high value at the frequency corresponding to its note, and low values elsewhere.

[[Parsec]]

CATEGORIES: Astronomical distances, Units of length

A parsec is a unit of distance used in astronomy. It is the distance that light travels in 3.26 years, or just under 31 trillion kilometres (about 19 trillion miles). This is from the definition: a parsec is the distance from the Sun to an object which has a parallax angle of one arcsecond.

Distances measured in fractions of a parsec usually involve objects within the same star system. 

Surveying provides an everyday example of parallax. Go outside and look at a distant object. Hold your hand out with one finger raised and close one eye. Line up your finger so it covers the object from view. Then close that eye and open the other without moving your arm. Now, move your finger to block that eye's line of sight. The two positions your finger was at  can be used to find the distance from the object. This is what a survey crew does to figure out land plot boundaries. The mathematical technique used in the calculation is trigonometry. A parsec is so large that if you could see that far that you would be looking in to the past. You are looking 3.26 years in the past because it takes 3.26 years for the light to come from a parsec away.

CATEGORIES: Webcomics

xkcd is a comic strip on the Internet. American cartoonist Randall Munroe draws and writes the comic. The comic is drawn in boxes. It is one of the most popular comics on the Internet. It is "a webcomic of romance, sarcasm, math and language". Sometimes, the readers of the comic act out things that Munroe puts in his comics. There are also messages in all comics that show up when moused over. In October 2007, the comic was viewed about 60 million times. The comic has won many awards. The name "xkcd" does not mean anything and was just made so people do not say it as a word. May 2021 there are more than 2400 different xkcd comics.

In November 2015, Munroe wrote a book named Thing Explainer,  using the same stick figure drawings from his comic. The book is about how things work, and is written in Simple English. It uses only one thousand different simple words. The idea for it came from a comic "Up goer Five" which is about the Saturn V rocket.

[[Migraine]]

CATEGORIES: Migraine, Pain, Syndromes

A migraine is a medical condition which usually causes a pounding, throbbing headache on one side of the head. The pain may be very bad and hurt so much that a person may have a hard time doing anything. While most people who have migraines get a headache, not everyone does. There are different kinds of migraines, and some do not cause a headache but do have other symptoms.

Most migraines cause a headache and nausea and might make the person dizzy or very sensitive to bright lights or loud noises. Some people have "auras" before a migraine starts, which means their ability to see becomes different. They may see funny patterns, have blurry vision, or may not be able to see at all. Other senses can change before or during a migraine, and the person may sense funny smells or tastes. Migraines can last a long time. Migraines usually last between four and 72 hours.

Migraines have been classified, based on how often they happen in a month: If a person has a headache for less than fifteen days, the migraine is called episodic migraine (EM).  If it happens more than fifteen days, it is called chronic migraine (CM). Chronic means it happens over a long amount of time. Some people who start off getting episodic migraines may start to get chronic migraines later. Chronic migraine then may revert or go back to episodic migraine.

Scientists have discovered that something called CGRP is the cause of migraines. CGRP stands for "calcitonin gene-related peptide". CGRP is a protein that causes migraines when it is released around the brain. What CGRP does, is that it causes a lot of inflammation in the meninges, a covering above the brain.

There are different risk factors which make a person more likely to have migraines. Being a female is a risk factor, and so is having family members who had migraines. For a person who has migraines, there are different trigger factors which may set off a migraine attack. In a large group of females who have migraines, one of the main trigger factors is when the amount of the hormone estrogen in their body either drops too low or fluctuates (goes up and down).

The World Health Organization says that migraine headache is the most costly brain problem for treatment and disability in the European Union and the United States.

A network bridge is a device which connects two parts of a network together at the data link layer (layer 2 of the OSI model). 

Network bridges work similarly to network switches, but the traffic is managed differently. A bridge will only send traffic from one side to the other if it is going to a destination on the other side. This is different to a layer 1 switch which sends all traffic from either side. Sometimes network bridges are called layer 2 switches. 

Since they need to look at the contents of the traffic going into them, they are much more complicated than a hub or repeater.

[[Great Northern War]]

CATEGORIES: Wars involving Russia

The Great Northern War (1700–1721), was a war fought between Sweden and the coalition of Russia, Saxony, Poland, and Denmark-Norway. In 1715 Prussia and Hannover joined the war against Sweden. The King of Hannover was also King George II of Great Britain.

After the coalition attacked them, Sweden invaded Russia in 1709 which was not a good idea. The Russian Army retreated  so the Swedish Army had to chase them. When winter came it was the coldest winter that Europe had had in a hundred years and half of the Swedish soldiers died in the cold. Eventually the Swedish army caught up to the Russian army and they had a battle, called the battle of Poltava. Russia won the battle but most of the Swedish soldiers, including king Charles XII of Sweden, escaped and went to the Ottoman Empire. Peter, the king of Russia, didn't like this so he declared war on the Ottoman Empire.  He lost and had to give the town of Azov back to the Ottomans.

Charles XII left the Ottoman Empire in 1714 and went to Stralsund in Pomerania which was owned by Sweden at the time but was under siege.  Charles escaped back to Sweden just before the people in Stralsund surrendered. Then he invaded Norway (which was owned by Denmark at the time.) and was shot and killed there. With their king gone, the Swedish soldiers left Norway and went back to Sweden. On the way back many soldiers died.

When all that was happening Russia had been invading Sweden. Russia conquered  Estonia, Livonia and Ingria. By the time the remaining soldiers had come back from Norway, Russia had completely conquered Finland. Sweden still didn't want peace though, because they would have to give lots of land to Russia. Russia used a newly made fleet of ships to attack and raid the Swedish Coast and Sweden would still not give up.  Eventually the Russian and Swedish ships came together in the Battle of Grengam. Both sides thought they had won the battle so no treaty was signed until the Russians continued using their boats to damage the Swedish coast. Finally Sweden gave up in 1721. Sweden had made peace with Denmark in 1720 and in 1721 Sweden signed the treaty of Nystad.

[[CentOS]]

CATEGORIES: Linux distributions

CentOS is a distribution (or distro) of Linux that is made to be similar to Red Hat. It was first made because the company that made Red Hat stopped making it free. Now, many people work on CentOS, and many more people use it on their computers. Often, CentOS is used on servers (computers which provide services to people or other computers) because it is stable (does not break often) and can be installed (put on a computer) in not much time, compared to other distributions such as Gentoo.

[[Thermal conductivity]]

CATEGORIES: Thermodynamics

Thermal conductivity is the ability of a material to conduct heat. Metals are good at heat conduction. The thermal conductivity of a material is a defining property that aids in the development of effective heating/cooling technologies. A value for thermal conductivity can be determined by measuring the rate at which heat can pass through a material. 

Thermal resistivity is the opposite of thermal conductivity. This means not conducting heat much. Materials with high resistivity are called "thermal insulators" and are used in clothing, thermoses, home insulation, and cars to keep people warm or in refrigerators, freezers, and thermoses to keep things cold. 

Some great thermal insulators are:

Some great thermal conductors are:

Silver is one of the most thermally conductive materials (and is relatively common), and because of this there are some cool experiments you can do with silver that show extremely well how thermal conduction works.

One example is when you put 2 spoons in boiling water, one spoon is steel and the other is silver. When you take the spoons out of the boiling water, the silver spoon is hotter than the steel spoon. The reason for this is that silver conducts heat better than steel. The silver spoon will also cool off faster because of this, as it is better at releasing heat.

Another example of silver's thermal conductivity is to put different materials on ice cubes.  An iron washer will just sit on the ice and slowly become colder.  A copper penny will melt through the ice cube and become colder faster.  A silver coin, spoon, or ring on the ice cube will sink into it almost as though the ice cube were made of thick syrup, and the silver will become ice cold almost instantly.  Again, this is because the silver is really good at drawing heat from the air and giving it to the ice cube.  Copper is also good at this, but not as much as silver.

[[Hydride]]

CATEGORIES: Chemistry

A hydride is a compound with hydrogen bonded to other elements. Except for a few of the Noble gases, all of the elements in the periodic table can form hydrides. The properties of hydrides can be very different, but some of the hydrides have similar properties. 

Metallic hydrides: compounds with ionic bonding. They are very reactive, making them difficult to dissolve. Most alkali metals and alkaline earth metals form ionic hydrides.

Metallic or Interstitial hydrides: These have metallic properties like good electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity. They are called interstitial because hydrogen can enter the metallic lattice (framework of metal atoms). Metallic hydrides are mostly formed from the metals in the groups 3 to 5 of the periodic table. Some of these are used in the nickel metal-hydride battery.

Covalent hydrides: These have covalent bonds between hydrogen and the other element. Most of the p-block elements form covalent hydrides. Many of these hydrides are unstable in air or water or when heated. Hydrocarbons are the hydrides of carbon, ammonia is a hydride of nitrogen, and water is a hydride of oxygen.

[[Hospice]]

CATEGORIES: Medicine, Death

A hospice is a type of medical treatment that helps take care of people who are very sick and have an illness that they will not be able to heal from. Many people staying in hospices have cancer or AIDS. People who stay in hospices are expected to die soon, but sometimes they get better. Hospices are different from other medicinal treatments because they mostly try to make people feel better instead of trying to cure them. Hospice tries to allow people to die with as little pain as possible.

Hospices have doctors, nurses, and other people who go to patients houses, nursing homes and hospitals to talk to people who want to use hospice medicine.

[[Higgs boson]]

CATEGORIES: Elementary particles

The Higgs boson (or Higgs particle) is a particle in the Standard Model of physics. In the 1960s Peter Higgs was the first person to suggest that this particle might exist. On 14 March 2013, scientists at CERN confirmed for the time that they had found a Higgs particle.

The Higgs particle is one of the 17 particles in the Standard Model, the model of physics which describes all known basic particles. The Higgs particle is a boson. Bosons are thought to be particles which are responsible for all physical forces. Other known bosons are the photon, the W and Z bosons, and the gluon. Scientists do not yet know how to combine gravity with the Standard Model.

The Higgs field is a fundamental field of crucial importance to particle physics theory. Unlike other known fields such as the electromagnetic field, the Higgs field takes the same non-zero value almost everywhere. The question of the Higgs field's existence was the last unverified part of the Standard Model of particle physics and, according to some, was "the central problem in particle physics".

It is difficult to detect the Higgs boson. The Higgs boson is very massive compared to other particles, so it does not last very long. There are usually no Higgs bosons around because it takes so much energy to make one. The Large Hadron Collider at CERN was built mainly for this reason. It speeds up two bunches of particles to almost light speed (travelling in opposite directions), before setting them on a path to collide with each other.

Each collision produces a flurry of new particles which are detected by detectors around the point where they collide. There is still only a very small chance, one in 10 billion, of a Higgs boson appearing and being detected. To find the few collisions with evidence of the Higgs boson, the LHC smashes together trillions of particles, and supercomputers sift through a massive amount of data.

Higgs bosons obey the conservation of energy law, which states that no energy is created or destroyed, but instead can be transferred or change form. First, the energy starts out in the gauge boson that interacts with the Higgs field. This energy is in the form of kinetic energy as movement. After the gauge boson interacts with the Higgs field, it slows down. This slowing down reduces the amount of kinetic energy in the gauge boson. However, this energy is not destroyed. Instead, the energy from the motion goes into the field and is converted into mass-energy, which is the energy stored in mass. The mass created can become what we call a Higgs boson. The amount of mass created comes from Einstein's famous equation E=mc2, which states that mass is equal to a large amount of energy (for example, 1 kg of mass is equivalent to almost 90 quadrillion joules of energy—the same amount of energy used by the entire world in roughly an hour and a quarter in 2008). Since the amount of mass-energy created by the Higgs field is equal to the amount of kinetic energy that the gauge boson lost by slowing down, energy is conserved.

Higgs bosons are used in a variety of science fiction stories. The physicist Leon Lederman called it the "God particle" in 1993.

[[Taylor series]]

CATEGORIES: Calculus

A Taylor series is an  idea used in computer science, calculus, chemistry, physics and other kinds of higher-level mathematics. It is a series that is used to create an estimate (guess) of what a function looks like. There is also a special kind of Taylor series called a Maclaurin series.

The theory behind the Taylor series is that if a point is chosen on the coordinate plane (x- and y-axes), then it is possible to guess what a function will look like in the area around that point. This is done by taking the derivatives of the function and adding them all together. The idea is that it is possible to add the infinite number of derivatives and come up with a single finite sum.

In mathematics, a Taylor series shows a function as the sum of an infinite series. The sum's terms are taken from the function's derivatives. Taylor series come from Taylor's theorem.

[[Tariff]]

CATEGORIES: Taxation

A tariff is a tax charged on goods as they pass between one country and another. A tariff can be placed on goods being brought into the country (imports), and goods being exported from the country to another. It is usually done to make money for the government. It may also be done for protectionism. Protectionism makes it easier for local products to sell by making products from foreign countries more expensive.

Often, one government will have an agreement with another not to place any tariffs on goods that are traded between them. This kind of agreement is called free trade.

[[Klemens Wenzel von Metternich]]

Klemens Wenzel, Prince von Metternich (German: Klemens Wenzel Nepomuk Lothar, Fürst von Metternich-Winneburg zu Beilstein) (May 15, 1773 – June 11, 1859) was an Austrian politician. He is thought of as one of the most important diplomats of all time. Metternich was Foreign Minister for Austria from 1809 to 1848. He got Austria out of a bad treaty with Napoleon, which forced Austria to fight for France. Metternich then helped to build a system in Europe that kept the peace for most of the next 100 years.

In 1809, when Metternich became foreign minister, Napoleon had control of most of Europe. France had taken over some of the closest countries directly. In more distant countries like Austria and Prussia, Napoleon forced them to sign treaties that would make them fight on his side in wars. Metternich thought that was bad for Austria. When Napoleon declared war and raised a huge army for the French invasion of Russia, Metternich told the Russians that Austria would not attack but only defend. Napoleon lost badly in Russia, and Metternich used that excuse to get out of the treaty.

In 1814, troops of the Quadruple Alliance (Prussia, Russia, Austria and the United Kingdom) had entered France, and Napoleon had lost the war. For the next year, diplomats from all over Europe met at the Congress of Vienna to decide the future after Napoleon.

Metternich believed that the best way to keep Europe peaceful was to create a balance of power, with no country being strong enough to beat all the other countries. To make sure that happened, he made some countries stronger so that other countries, especially France, would think twice about going to war. For example, he added Belgium and Luxembourg to the 

Netherlands, he turned 300 small countries of Germany into a group of larger countries, and he put together some countries in what we call Italy today.

After making that new order, Metternich also did a lot to keep it together. For example, he Alexander I of Russia Alexander wanted to send troops to Greece to protect Orthodox Christians there fighting the Greek War of Independence against the Ottoman Empire, which was Muslim. The Ottomans had become weak, and Alexander would probably have won. Metternich was afraid that if the Ottoman Empire fell apart, all of the powerful countries in Europe would start fighting to get its land. That would upset Metternich's balance and start a huge war. Also, Russia might get too big and too powerful. Therefore, Metternich convinced the Alexander attacking now would make the Ottomans would fall apart before Alexander was ready to take it for himself, and the United Kingdom and France would get most of it. Alexander agreed to help keep the Ottoman Empire going so that Russia could later take all of it. Also, he was talked out of sending troops to Greece.

Metternich kept peace in Europe for a long time, but there were still some revolts in Europe. Finally in 1848, many revolts happened at the same time. One of them was in Austria, and the rebels had Metternich taken out of office. After he was gone, Otto von Bismarck in Prussia managed to become powerful, take over the German Confederation and start a big German country, which still exists. Having one big Germany, however, upset Metternich's balance and helped to cause World War I.

[[German Confederation]]

CATEGORIES: 19th century in Austria, 19th century in Germany, Former German countries, 1815 establishments in Europe, 1866 disestablishments, 1860s disestablishments in Europe

The German Confederation replaced the Holy Roman Empire in Central Europe. After the Holy Roman Empire fell, Germany had fallen into over 300 different small kingdoms. In 1815, the Congress of Vienna decided that these weak kingdoms were not strong enough to keep France from trying to take them over, which it had already done once under Napoleon. So the Congress combined all those little countries into 39 larger countries, which were still very small compared to the powerful countries of Europe. 

The problem was that the Congress did not want to make them too strong, or they'd start taking over other countries. So they put the 39 countries into a confederation which meant that they were all separate countries, but they agreed to help defend each other, and in some ways acted like one big country. The Confederation would not be strong enough to attack another country; only strong enough to preserve the European balance of power. 

The German Confederation lasted until 1866, when the members fought each other. The winners formed a new North German Confederation. In 1871 after winning the Franco-Prussian War, Otto von Bismarck, chancellor of Prussia, combined all the countries of Germany into the German Empire.

A howitzer is a special type of big gun used by an army. It has a short barrel, and is used fire a shell over a short distance. The barrel length of a howitzer is 15 to 25 times of the caliber. Howitzers are special because they're made to fire higher than a cannon but lower than a mortar. Howitzers are almost always used to shoot at targets on the ground, but they can be used for targets on water, or in the air. The name howitzer comes from an old Czech word, haufnice, which was a catapult that could fire many stones.

[[Dendrite]]

CATEGORIES: Anatomy of the nervous system

Dendrites are the branches of neurons that receive signals from other neurons. The signals go into the cell body (or soma).

A cell may have hundreds of dendrites, but may have only one axon. The dendrites carry signals from other neurons into the soma, and the axon carries a single signal from the soma to the next neuron or to a muscle fiber.

A dendrite from one neuron and an axon from another neuron meet at a synapse, which is a very narrow gap between the two cells. When electrical impulses reach the end of an axon, they trigger the release of chemicals called neurotransmitters. These chemicals cross the synapse to the dendrite, where they trigger the flow of ions into or out of the cell.

The movement of the charged ions in the dendrite causes an electrical current, which spreads to the soma briefly before being restored to normal.

If the dendrites get lots of signals from axons, then it sets off a chain reaction. The chain reaction is a strong electrical current called an action potential that flows down the axon to the next synapse.

Fully differentiated neurons do not divide. However, stem cells in the adult brain may regenerate functional neurons throughout the life of an organism. Generally, once born, neurons do not divide. Many will live the whole lifetime of the animal.

CATEGORIES: Diseases spread by insects, Diseases caused by viruses

Dengue fever (pronounced "DEN-gi") is a  tropical infectious disease caused by the dengue virus. People get the dengue virus from mosquitoes. Dengue fever is also called break-bone fever, because it can cause so much pain that people feel like their bones are breaking.

Most people with dengue fever can get better just by drinking enough water.  However, a small number of people get dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome.  These are medical emergencies and can kill a person if they do not get medical treatment.

There is no vaccine that can keep people from getting the dengue virus.  There is also no treatment to cure dengue fever.  Doctors can only provide "supportive care," which means they can only treat dengue's symptoms.

Since the 1960s, many more people have been getting dengue fever.  Since World War II, dengue has become a problem around the world.  It is common in more than 110 countries. Every year, between 50 million and 100 million people get dengue fever.

10 million people speak the language. It has three stocks: the Sicilian, the Calabro-Sicilian and Salentinu.

Compared to Italian, it is a distinctly separate form of verbal communication patterned by many years of foreign influence.  Efforts to force Sicilians to speak conventional Italian include schools, television and radio.  Italians maintain that Sicilian is simply a subset dialect of Italian, while Sicilians see their spoken word as a true and separate language.

Installation means to put a program on a computer so that the computer can run it.

Most programs are stored in special ways to make them smaller, or to gather all the different pieces of a program up into one big piece. Before it can be used, though, the program needs to have these changes undone. Some programs also need to know extra information about the computer it is going to run on, so while it is installing, it will figure out what it needs to know and write it down for later.

[[Cohomology]]

CATEGORIES: Algebra

Cohomology is something in higher math which is sometimes used to solve certain math problems.

[[Laplace transform]]

CATEGORIES: Calculus

The Laplace transform is a way to turn functions into other functions in order to do certain calculations more easily. This way of turning functions to other functions is very similar to U Substitution. The aim of this change is to be able to turn the hard work of integration into a simple algebraic addition and subtraction, just as logarithms allow one to add and subtract instead of multiplying and dividing. An example of its use is in ruin theory, which is a subject of actuarial science with regards to insurance.

Functions usually take a variable (say t) as an input, and give some output (say f). The Laplace transform converts these functions to take some other input (s) and give some other output (F). Because of certain shared properties of Laplace transforms, this makes it very easy to manipulate the original function into something useful.

[[Cyperaceae]]

CATEGORIES: Poales

The family Cyperaceae, or the sedges, is a taxon of flowering plants. They look like grasses or rushes, but are not. They are monocot plants (as are grasses), but belong to a different family. 

The family is large, with some 5,500 species described in about 109 genera. The largest is the Carex genus of "true sedges", with over 2,000 species.

Sedges include many wild marsh and grassland plants, and some cultivated ones such as water chestnut (Eleocharis dulcis) and papyrus sedge (Cyperus papyrus). These species are widely distributed, with many in tropical Asia and tropical South America. Sedges may be found growing in almost all environments. Many are wetlands, or have poor soils. Ecological communities dominated by sedges are known as sedgelands.

Features distinguishing members of the sedge family from grasses or rushes are stems with triangular cross-sections (with occasional exceptions) and leaves that are spirally arranged in three ranks (grasses have alternate leaves forming two ranks).

[[Animal trapping]]

CATEGORIES: Animals, Traps

Animal trapping, or simply trapping, is the use of a device to catch an animal. Animals may be trapped for a variety of purposes, including food, wildlife management, hunting and pest control. Each year, over 5 million wild animals, including coyotes, foxes and bobcats, are caught and killed in wild traps, mainly in the US, Canada and Russia, although trapping does occur in other countries too on a smaller scale. Traps are indiscriminate, catching the first animal to step on them. Countless dogs and cats, deer, birds and other animals—including threatened and endangered animals—are also injured and killed each year by the traps. Trap checking times range from once every 24 hours to once every 14 days. The regulations on trapping are weak and extremely difficult to enforce, which means untold amounts of animal suffering goes undocumented and uninvestigated. 

Many animals die trying to free themselves, next to dehydration, blood loss and hypothermia. Often animals become so desperate, they resort to chewing or wringing off their own trapped limb in order to escape, breaking teeth and bones in the process. Some may die from blood loss or shock but most animals will be trapped for days before the trapper returns to kill them. 

There are many kinds. For a deadfall trap, a trapper digs a deep hole in the ground and hides it so the animal falls in the hole and can not get out. A snare is a noose that tightens around the neck or other part of the animal.

Over 100 countries, including the EU and China, have prohibited the use of the steel-jaw leghold trap. But in the United States, steel-jaw traps are not only legal, they are the go-to tool for trappers who capture and kill millions of wild animals a year for the global fur market. In September 2019, California became the first state in the US to ban trapping for commercial and recreational purpose.

[[Building material]]

CATEGORIES: Materials, Construction

Building material is any material which is used for a construction purpose. Many naturally occurring substances, such as clay, sand, wood and rocks, even twigs and leaves have been used to construct buildings. Apart from naturally occurring materials, many man-made products are in use, some more and some less synthetic. 

Bricks are man-made, and so is plaster, concrete, stucco and many other materials. However, they are usually still made out of natural materials, bricks being a good example. They are based on clay. Steel is based on natural types of iron.

One example of a man-made imitation is scagliola, which can imitate more expensive natural materials such as marble.

[[Pumice]]

CATEGORIES: Igneous rocks

Pumice is a term for a lightweight volcanic rock. 

It is a solidified frothy lava, created when highly-heated, pressured molten rock is shot out from a volcano. Its light weight is due to air spaces, which are caused by fast cooling and loss of pressure. The loss of pressure makes bubbles by lowering the boiling point of the lava (like the bubble-creation when a carbonated drink is opened). The  cooling then freezes the bubbles in the matrix.

[[Alabaster]]

CATEGORIES: Minerals, Building materials, Sedimentary rocks

Alabaster is a name applied to varieties of two distinct minerals. Gypsum is a hydrous sulfate of calcium, and calcite is a carbonate of calcium. Gypsum is the alabaster of the present day; calcite is generally the alabaster of the ancients. Both are easy to work. They are attractive to look at. Both have been used for making a variety of artworks and objects, especially small carvings.

The two kinds are easy to tell apart. One is harder than the other. Calcite is hard (Mohs hardness 3). Gypsum is soft (Mohs hardness 1.5 to 2). It can be easily scratched by a fingernail. Also, calcite effervesces when it is treated with hydrochloric acid. Gypsum does not.

[[Information security]]

CATEGORIES: Security

Information security is about protecting information so that people who should not have access to it cannot distribute, see, change, or delete it. Although this has a lot in common with computer security, information risk management and information assurance, it is different from them. For example, computer security can focus on making sure that the computer is available when it is needed and that it works correctly but may not have anything to do with the data that it stores.

Information security has to do with the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data in any form e.g. electronic, print, or other forms. Organizations, including governments, private businesses and others have much information stored and processed on computers. Data that is lost or released to the wrong people or that is not properly secured could lead to legal and ethical problems for the organization.

For an individual person, information security has a big effect on privacy, which is viewed very differently by people in different cultures.

[[Laminar flow]]

CATEGORIES: Fluid mechanics

Laminar flow is characterized by the smooth flow of a liquid. This tends to happen at low velocities when there are few disturbances, such as in a straight, smooth pipe. In laminar flow through a pipe, it is assumed that the velocity of the fluid is zero at the boundaries of the pipe and is at a maximum in the center; mathematically, the velocity profile is parabolic. Microscopically, the particles or pieces of the liquid flow in a straight line along the direction of the pipe and do not mix with other layers of fluid. The layers slide past one another like playing cards. This is in contrast to turbulent flow, when a fluid swirls around.

Even though there is no mixing, there is still some friction in the flow. This friction will cause a pressure drop and its numerical value is given by the Hagen-Poiseuille equation.sci-stub

[[Capillary action]]

CATEGORIES: Physics

Capillary action means either of two things:

Capillary action is a result of the surface tension of liquids. 

An example of capillary action is what happens inside a drinking straw left in a cup of water. The force of adhesion which holds the water together and to the straw is a little stronger than gravity, so the water will rise inside the straw a little higher than the rest of the water.

Another example is what happens when putting a sponge in a puddle of water. The little bubbles in the sponge work like many straws gathered together. When the sponge is dipped in water, the water starts to go into the holes, and the bubbles that are inside the sponge pull on the water that they touch.

Capillary action also takes place inside the human body. For example, it removes tears from the eyes.

Jacob had an older brother, Esau. His mother was named Rebecca and his father named Isaac. According to the Talmud, immediately after Abraham died, Jacob prepared a lentil stew as a traditional mourner's meal for his father. The Hebrew Bible says that Esau, who was very hungry, begged Jacob to give him some of the stew. (Esau called the dish, "that red, red stuff", which is why he is called Edom, אדום (`Edom, meaning "Red").) Jacob said, "If you give me your birthright I will give you some stew." Esau agreed. Soon, Issac became almost blind. Rebecca tricked Issac into giving Jacob the blessing. Jacob's brother got angry, so Rebecca sent Jacob away.

Jacob works for his uncle Laban so he can marry his daughter Rachel. But he is tricked into marrying Leah, her older sister as well. He has children with both women, and with their concubines.

He is very upset when his son Joseph is sold into slavery in Egypt by his brothers. Jacob moves to Egypt when there is a famine. He dies and is buried in Canaan.

[[Bhopal disaster]]

CATEGORIES: 1984 in Asia, 1980s in India, Bhopal, December events, Disasters in India, Disasters in the 1980s

The Bhopal disaster or Bhopal gas tragedy was an industrial accident.  It happened at a Union Carbide subsidiary pesticide plant in the city of Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, India.  On the night of 2-3 December 1984, the plant released approximately 40 tonnes of toxic methyl isocyanate (MIC) gas, exposing more than 500,000 people to toxic gases. 

A mixture of poisonous gases flooded the city, causing great panic as people woke up with a burning sensation in their lungs. Thousands died immediately from the effects of the gas. Many were trampled in the panic that followed. The first official immediate death toll was 3,598 in 1989.  Another estimate is that 8,000 died within two weeks, that an additional 8,000 have since died from gas-related diseases.

The Bhopal disaster is frequently cited as the world's worst industrial disaster. The International Medical Commission on Bhopal was established in 1993 to respond to the long term health effects of the disaster. The owner of the factory, UCIL, was majority owned by UCC, with Indian Government-controlled banks and the Indian public holding a 49.1 percent stake. In 1989, UCC paid $470 million ($929 million in 2017 dollars) to settle litigation stemming from the disaster. In 1994, UCC sold its stake in UCIL to EverReady Industries India Limited  (EIIL), which subsequently merged with McLeod Russel (India) Ltd. Eveready ended clean-up on the site in 1998, when it terminated its 99-year lease and turned over control of the site to the state government of Madhya Pradesh. Dow Chemical Company purchased UCC in 2001, seventeen years after the disaster.

Civil and criminal cases were filed in the District Court of Bhopal, India, involving UCC and Warren Anderson, UCC CEO at the time of the disaster.78 In June 2010, seven former employees, including the former UCIL chairman, were convicted in Bhopal of causing death by negligence and sentenced to two years imprisonment and a fine of about $2,000 each, the maximum punishment allowed by Indian law. An eighth former employee was also convicted but died before the judgment was passed.2 Anderson died on 29 September 2014. (9)

[[Symbolism (art)]]

CATEGORIES: Art movements, Symbolism

Symbolism was a late 19th-century art movement of French, Russian and Belgian origin. The movement rejected realism and naturalism, and included poetry and other arts. Symbolists believed that art should represent absolute truths that could only be described indirectly. Thus a symbolist painting may look realistic, but actually it represents a non-visual idea.

In literature, the style started with the publication Les Fleurs du mal (The Flowers of Evil, 1857) by Charles Baudelaire. The works of Edgar Allan Poe, which Baudelaire admired greatly and translated into French, were a significant influence and the source of many stock tropes and images. The name "symbolist" itself was first used by the critic Jean Moréas, who invented it to distinguish the symbolists from similar styles of literature and art. Symbolism in art is related to the gothic component of Romanticism.http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/harris/Rom_Links.htm

There were several groups of Symbolist painters and visual artists, including Gustave Moreau, Gustav Klimt, Odilon Redon, Henri Fantin-Latour, Gaston Bussière, Edvard Munch, Félicien Rops, and Jan Toorop. Symbolism in painting was even more widespread geographically than symbolism in poetry. Its ideas affected Mikhail Vrubel, Nicholas Roerich, Martiros Saryan, Mikhail Nesterov, Léon Bakst, Elena Gorokhova in Russia, as well as Frida Kahlo in Mexico and David Chetlahe Paladin in the United States.  Auguste Rodin is sometimes considered a symbolist sculptor.

The symbolist painters used mythological and dream imagery. The symbols used by symbolism are not the familiar emblems of mainstream iconography but intensely personal, private, obscure and ambiguous references. More a philosophy than an actual style of art, symbolism in painting influenced the contemporary Art Nouveau style and Les Nabis.

[[Rationality]]

CATEGORIES: Philosophy

Rationality is the state that exists when reason is used. It's also related to moderation in some contexts and sensibility in others.

When a person is reasonable or rational they are using all available information to make a decision, and whether their decision can be judged as rational or reasonable depends on the reasons they made it. If they believe that the most important factor in any decision is how they will personally benefit, then self-interested or even selfish behavior would be rational. But if they believe that benefiting a group of people is more important than benefiting just one person, then purely selfish behavior is irrational. Determinations of rationality depend on context, the background information and assumptions.

[[Corruption]]

CATEGORIES: Politics

Corruption is a system that starts out good but somehow goes wrong. The word comes from a Latin word meaning "Rotting". Corruption could be a government doing what they say is good, but instead oppress people, or an official doing something wrong. It can also mean a computer file or computer program which malfunctions or becomes infected with a computer virus. 

Sometimes the term just means bribery.

[[Oppression]]

CATEGORIES: Sociology

Oppression is when a person or group of people who have power use it in a way that is not fair, unjust or cruel. It can also describe the feeling of people who are oppressed. Oppressive governments can lead to a rebellion.

Racism, sexism and other prejudices can cause oppression, especially if laws are made based on them.

Anarchists say that all government, police and laws are oppressive. This is because they stop people from doing whatever they want to.

The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the idea of human rights in general, is meant to stop oppression.

[[Meritocracy]]

CATEGORIES: Relationships, Society

A meritocracy is the condition where people who deserve to can go up in rank, as opposed to a system like nepotism. It applies generally to all positions to which people may be appointed. It is often reinforced by laws, such as that women should have equal opportunities to men in employment.

The philosopher Plato thought that a government based on merit was better than democracy. In democracy, there is no guarantee that you will get the best person, the most qualified person, ruling the state. His criticisms were really of Athenian (or direct) democracy, where anyone could be selected to rule.

In a meritocracy, the people are chosen who are thought to be the best. Some have accused it of being elitist, saying that government by the best will mean that only those who have had the right opportunities will have a chance to govern, creating in effect a ruling class.

It is worth pointing out that Plato did not see it this way. He believed that philosophers were the best people to rule because they were disinterested, meaning they only had the interests of the state in mind, not their own interest. Plato's point was this: if you want to rule, then it will go wrong, because power will corrupt you. If you are a philosopher, you don't care about power  all you care about is truth, so you will rule well, without being interested in your power or status.

[[Nepotism]]

CATEGORIES: Relationships, Society

Nepotism is when a person in authority gives jobs to their relatives. It comes from the practice of mediaeval Popes, appointing their nephews to important positions. Nepote is Italian for 'nephew'.

For instance, Pope Callixtus III, head of the Borgia family, made two of his nephews cardinals; one of them, Rodrigo, later used his position as a cardinal as a stepping stone to the papacy, becoming Pope Alexander VI. Alexander then elevated Alessandro Farnese, his mistress's brother, to cardinal; Farnese would later go on to become Pope Paul III. Paul III was a notorious nepotist. When elected Pope in 1534 he appointed two nephews, aged 14 and 16, as cardinals. 

The practice was finally ended when Pope Innocent XII issued the bull Romanum decet Pontificem, in 1692. The papal bull prohibited popes in all times from bestowing estates, offices, or revenues on any relative, with the exception that one qualified relative (at most) could be made a cardinal.

In the modern world, nepotism is thought to be wrong, and conflicts with the principle of merit, where the best person gets the job (meritocracy). The argument against the widespread nepotism in countries like Italy is that it damages the economy of the country, though that is difficult to prove.

[[Mindset]]

CATEGORIES: Psychology

A mindset is a state that usually a majority of people would have in a particular time or occasion. It is formed from things that people are convinced about. It is like a collected norm.

Mindset can also be about how people see their abilities. In this sense, people have two types of mindsets: fixed and growth mindsets. Psychologist Carol Dweck explains that students with fixed mindset believe their basic abilities, their intelligence, their talents, are just fixed characteristics . They have a certain amount and they improve, and then their goal becomes to look smart all the time and never look dumb. In a growth mindset students understand that their talents and abilities can be developed through effort, good teaching and working hard. They don't necessarily think everyone's the same or anyone can be Einstein, but they believe everyone can get smarter if they work at it.

[[Human powered aircraft]]

CATEGORIES: Aviation, Aircraft

A human powered aircraft is an aircraft that is powered entirely or partly by the pilot(s).  Several human powered aircraft have been constructed in the past 30 years for recreation or to win prizes.

Designing a successful human-powered aircraft is difficult because a very large power to weight ratio must be achieved.  This has been the reason why many of these aircraft use advanced composite materials in their construction.

There are human-powered aircraft being designed and made now.  One aircraft is being built by Virginia Tech University named the Iron Butterfly.  Another one is being built by the Pennsylvania State University named the Zephyrus.

[[Social interaction]]

CATEGORIES: Sociology, Human communication

A social interaction or social relation is the way people talk and act with each other. It may include interactions in a team, family or  bureaucracy. It includes any relationship between two or more individuals.

It is a source of socialization and it characterizes all types of social relationships.

According to Gish and N.P, " Social interaction is the reciprocal influence human beings exert on each other through inter stimulation and response."

[[Interstitial fluid]]

CATEGORIES: Physiology

Interstitial fluid is a type of fluid in the body. It is found in the interstitial spaces or tissue spaces - the fluid-filled areas that surround cells. It makes up about 3/4 of all extracellular fluid. It's main purpose is provide cells with nutrients and assist the cells in waste removal.

Some components of interstitial fluid are plasmatic, lymphatic, intraocular, synovial, pericardial, intrapleural, peritoneal, and digestive fluids.

[[Extracellular fluid]]

Extracellular fluid is body fluid that exists outside cells. It makes up about one-third (1/3) of all body water.

[[Fairness]]

CATEGORIES: Sociology

Fairness is the concept in sociology, law and generally in society, that something should be equal and not be a contradiction to accepted standards. It's related to justice in both the legal and sociological sense. Fairness is also treating others equally or in a way that is considered right or reasonable. Fairness can mean sameness where everything is kept equal by being the same. Fairness can also mean "deservedness" meaning a person gets what they deserve. People who are successful by working hard get what they deserve. People who are lazy and do not work hard get less. Fairness can also be based on need. Those who have more should give more to help others. This is based on the concept that people have obligations to each other. Judges, lawmakers, referees and teachers are among those expected to be fair in their decisions. Fairness is keeping decisions free from any form of discrimination.

In the United States fairness has long been a battle between equality and equity.  Equality is the idea everyone should have an equal opportunity. If all the horses in a race start from the same point, the horse that wins is the fastest. Equity is the idea that adjustments need to be made to make things fair for both entities. One should get more than the other because that would be fair in this sense. For example, in the game of golf, when playing a skilled golfer, a less skilled golfer may be given a "handicap" (extra points) at the start of the game. This is to help make the final score fair for both players.

In November 2007, she came out with her first metal album, My Winter Storm, which had a lot of different music types on it like rock and heavy metal. In 2010 she made "What Lies Beneath", her second metal album without Nightwish. She played some concerts in Europe, and was in well known heavy metal festivals. She made a whole tour for these two albums. In August 2013, she made her third metal album, "Colours in the Dark", which is a very optimistic album and in August 2016, she made her fourth metal album, "The Shadow Self", which is also very optimistic. In December 2017, she made her second magical Christmas album, called "From Spirits and Ghosts (Score for a Dark Christmas)".

[[Gerontocracy]]

CATEGORIES: Forms of government

Gerontocracy is a system of government in which old people make the policies and control the country. It may be ageist as much as it may be conservative.

[[Ageism]]

CATEGORIES: Discrimination

Ageism is when a person is treated badly only because of their age. Ageism can be discrimination by one person or by a part of society as a group. Discrimination is when a person is left out or abused by somebody who does not like something about them. For example,  their facial features, their height or their skin.

There have been many issues at the British broadcasting company, BBC, dealing with people saying that they have issues with ageism. Ageism is often common in the entertainment industry where what a person looks like is felt by many to be important.

There are two targets for age discrimination: old people (also called senior citizens) and young people. Discrimination against old and young people can happen at places like job interviews. For example, a company might hire a worker who is about 30 years old instead of someone who is about 50 years old, or someone who is around 20 years old, regardless of skill level. Another common example of ageism is not allowing "minors", or young people, to vote, drink, drive, work, marry, gamble, or give sexual consent.

[[Technocracy]]

CATEGORIES: Forms of government

Technocracy is a government by scientific method and controlled by technical people. These people include engineers, (who make, build, and maintain engines, machines, public works, and other technologies). "Technocrats" want to improve social and political problems based on technical and "scientific" (technological) solutions. They promise to help solve these problems concerning industries (big business), trade, and how to create and distribute wealth using scientific management. A method of study that uses time and motion to work out the most efficient ways to do something, mainly repeated, routine motions. The man that made the theory of Scientific Management was named Frederick W. Taylor. 

However, Scientific Management was still trying to fix social and political problems with technical solutions. Many of the technological solutions may have solved one problem, while creating many more. Technocrats believed that management could replace politics. Administration is based on the application of rules that make certain outcomes, there are too many different points of view for the management approach to work.

[[Kleptocracy]]

CATEGORIES: Politics

Kleptocracy ('klepto' meaning 'theft' in Ancient Greek) is the ruling of possibly any kind of government that uses its power to steal from its people.  This rarely-applied word was used by Charles Krauthammer, the nationally syndicated Washington Post columnist and political commentator on Fox-TV, on Saturday, March 2, and Sunday, March 3, 2014.  He referred to Russia as a kleptocracy in a TV panel discussion about its influence in the revolution in the neighboring Ukraine in late February.  His political column added another derivation of this word: kleptocratic.

"Kleptocratic" is used by Krauthammer in the following quote: "But surely the West has more financial clout than Russia's kleptocratic extraction economy that exports little but oil, gas and wisky."

[[Riemann hypothesis]]

CATEGORIES: Number theory, Conjectures

The Riemann hypothesis is a mathematical question (conjecture). Lots of people think that finding a proof of the hypothesis is one of the hardest and most important unsolved problems of pure mathematics. Pure mathematics is a type of mathematics that is about thinking about mathematics. This is different from trying to put mathematics into the real world. The answer to the Riemann hypothesis is "yes" or "no". 

The conjecture is named after a man called Bernhard Riemann. He lived in the 1800s. The Riemann hypothesis asks a question about a special thing called the Riemann zeta function. 

If the answer to the question is "yes", this would mean mathematicians can know more about prime numbers. Specifically, it would help them know how to find prime numbers. The Riemann hypothesis is so important, and so difficult to prove, that the Clay Mathematics Institute has offered $1,000,000 to the first person to prove it.

Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, or RPI is a private university in Troy, NY. It was made in 1824 by Stephen Van Rensselaer because he wanted there to be schools that taught science and engineering. It is the oldest engineering school in America. Lots of students from RPI get jobs that pay a lot of money after they leave RPI. Some people who went to RPI have started big companies like NVIDIA, John Wiley and Sons, and Texas Instruments. George Low, an American who helped get spaceships into space, went to RPI.

What RPI focuses on has changed a lot since it was first made.  There still is a lot of engineering at the school, but now there is growing arts and social studies teaching at the school. A big concert hall called EMPAC was opened in 2008 at RPI.

Most of RPI's sports teams play in NCAA Division III, which does not allow athletic scholarships. The men's and women's ice hockey teams play as Division I teams in ECAC Hockey. The hockey teams are can award scholarships because of a special NCAA rule.

[[Mach number]]

CATEGORIES: Fluid mechanics, Measurement

A mach number is a number that describes speed. It is a measure of the speed of an object compared to the speed of sound. Mach number is given as a percentage compared to the local speed of sound. For example, half the speed of sound = Mach 0.5.

Where v is the speed of the object, and a is the speed of sound.

It is named after the Austrian physicist Ernst Mach. When writing a speed as a Mach number, the number comes after "Mach." For example, the Concorde airplane could fly at Mach 2, and a satellite re-enters the Earth's atmosphere at about Mach 25.

[[Transonic]]

CATEGORIES: Aviation, Sound

Transonic means breaking the sound barrier by travelling faster than the speed of sound (1,236 kph or 768 mph).

The speed of flight is divided into four groups based on speed.

Transonic means going from subsonic to supersonic.  Subsonic ends and supersonic begins at mach 1, so transonic goes from mach 0.8 to 1.2.  When you are going through transonic speeds, drag increases and it is really hard to go any faster.  This is the sound barrier.

[[Lobotomy]]

CATEGORIES: Surgery, Brain

Lobotomy, also known as leucotomy, is a type of brain surgery. It was created in 1935 by António Egas Moniz, a Portuguese neurologist. He won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1949 "for his discovery of the therapeutic value of leucotomy in certain psychoses". The operation cut the connections from the pre-frontal cortex (front part of the frontal lobes) to the rest of the brain. At first it seemed a great success, but the operation is now rarely done.

He used the method for certain types of mental illness for which there was no other treatment. He first used it on patients with obsessive behaviour, which they repeated time and again. It was also used to treat other mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia and clinical depression. 

The problem with lobotomies was that they forever changed a person's personality and behaviour. Sometimes, the results were beneficial: patients which had been violent became calm. But long-term studies, which were not done by Moniz, show some had severely damaged personalities.  They often had very little 'drive' and motivation.

Today, antipsychotic drugs, like chlorpromazine, may treat the symptoms of such disorders. Lobotomies are not common today.

[[Hot air balloon]]

CATEGORIES: Aircraft

A hot air balloon is a type of aircraft. It is lifted by heating the air inside the balloon, usually with fire. Hot air weighs less than the same volume of cold air (it is less dense), which means that hot air will rise up or float when there is cold air around it, just like a bubble of air in a pot of water. The greater the difference between the hot and the cold, the greater the difference in density, and the stronger the balloon will pull up. This means that balloons can carry more weight on a cold day, or if the air inside the balloon is very hot. At higher temperature, the air molecules move faster. This causes the molecules to spread out and therefore hot air is less dense than cooler air.

[[Biplane]]

CATEGORIES: Aircraft

A biplane is a fixed-wing aircraft that has two fixed wings.  The lower wing is often attached to the body of the aircraft and the top wing is raised above.  Most early airplanes were biplanes because they have a stronger structure than a monoplane.  When engineers found how to makes strong monoplanes, biplanes became rare because they produce more drag.  

Famous biplanes include the Polikarpov Po-2, Sopwith Camel, Avro Tutor, Antonov An-2, Beechcraft Staggerwing, Boeing Stearman, Bristol Bulldog, Curtiss JN-4, de Havilland Tiger Moth, Fairey Swordfish, Hawker Hart, Pitts Special and the Wright Flyer.

[[Blank slate]]

CATEGORIES: Psychology

For the book see here

Blank slate, or tabula rasa (which means the same thing) was a philosophical idea of John Locke. It had, like much of philosophy, a history which went as far back as Aristotle, but it was Locke who made it known to our modern world:

Humans, when born, are thought not have mental experience or knowledge, and that everything is learned after they grow. In particular, Locke thought all knowledge came from sense data, and the mind is empty at the beginning. By 'sense data' is meant the process of hearing, seeing, touching etc.

Locke's idea was immediately picked up by others:

Many have held similar views. The founder of behaviourism, John B. Watson (1878–1938):

Throughout the 20th century the influence of evolution and genetics ran against these liberal ideas. Ethology proved that much animal behaviour was inherited, instinctual, (innate and permanent). Konrad Lorenz argued that the aggression so obvious in the history of mankind was a playing out of behaviour which had evolutionary advantage in our past. The field of evolutionary psychology set out to examine the role played by evolution on our mental life. If humans share a common evolutionary history with the other animals, it is likely that we inherit mental traits from our evolution. The human ability to learn a language is inherited, and is of huge practical importance. Very important also (though less obvious) is the way that our unconscious mind helps us get through life. The apparatus which performs that mental activity is certainly inherited. These are some reasons why a number of recent publications have rejected Locke's idea.

The coypu (or nutria, Myocastor coypus) is a large, plant-eating, rodent which lives in wetlands. The nutria first came from South America including Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay, Chile, and Uruguay. Animals were taken to Louisiana in the 1930s to be farmed for their fur. Some of these animals escaped and are now living in the Louisiana coastal wetlands. They have become a pest and have damaged the environment.

[[Poincaré conjecture]]

CATEGORIES: Geometry

The Poincaré Conjecture is a question about spheres in mathematics. It is named after Henri Poincaré, the French mathematician and physicist who formulated it in 1904.

The sphere (also called the 2-sphere, as it is a 2-dimensional surface, although it is usually seen as inside a three dimensional space) has the property that any loop on it can be contracted to a point (if a rubber band is wrapped around the sphere, it is possible to slide it down to a point). Mathematicians say that the 2-sphere is simply connected. Other spaces do not have this property, for example the donut: a rubber band that goes around the whole donut once cannot be slid down to a point without it leaving the surface.

Mathematicians knew that this property was unique to the 2-sphere, in the sense that any other simply connected space that does not have edges and is small enough (in mathematician terms, that is compact) is in fact the 2-sphere. It is no longer true if we remove the idea of smallness however, as an infinitely large plane is also simply connected. Also, a regular disk (a circle and its interior) is simply connected, but it has an edge (the bounding circle).

The conjecture asks whether the same is true for the 3-sphere, which is an object living naturally in four dimensions. This question motivated much of modern mathematics, especially in the field of topology. The question was finally settled in 2002 by Grigori Perelman, a Russian mathematician, with methods from geometry, showing that it is indeed true. He was awarded a Fields Medal and the $1 million Millennium Prize for his work, both of which he declined.

The Poincaré conjecture can also be extended to higher dimensions: this is the generalised Poincaré conjecture. Surprisingly, it was easier to prove the fact for higher-dimensional spheres: In 1960, Smale proved it to be true for the 5-sphere, 6-sphere and higher. In 1982, Freedman proved that it was also true for the 4-sphere, for which he was awarded a Fields Medal.

[[Megafauna]]

CATEGORIES: Megafauna

Megafauna are large animals. The word is most used for the Pleistocene megafauna  the large land animals of the last ice age, such as mammoths. It is also used for the largest living wild land animals, especially elephants, giraffes, hippopotamus, rhinoceros, elk, condors, etc.

Its use is connected with the discussion about the Holocene extinctions after the ice age. Most of the large land animals which were alive 12,000 years ago are now extinct, and there is much discussion as to what has caused this. The two main theories are hunting by humans, and climate change. Together, these reasons are enough to explain why these previously successful animals are now extinct. Elephant birds on Madagascar were certainly hunted to extinction, as were the Moas in New Zealand.  Archaeological sites with evidence of moa hunting are all over New Zealand. The moas became extinct about five hundred years ago. The moas had survived being hunted by Haast's Eagle, but they did not survive being hunted for food by the Maoris.

For many others the climate changes may have been the main reason for their extinction.

[[Cucurbitales]]

CATEGORIES: Cucurbitales

The Cucurbitales is an order of flowering plants, included in the rosid group of dicotyledons. This order mostly belongs to tropical areas, with limited presence in subtropic and temperate regions. The order includes various shrubs and trees, together with many herbs and climbing plants.

One of major characteristics of the Cucurbitales is the presence of unisexual flowers, with thick pointed petals (whenever present). The pollination is usually performed by insects, but wind pollination, where flowers use the wind to move pollen from one flower to the next, is also present (in Coriariaceae and Datiscaceae).

The order consists of roughly 2600 species in eight families. The largest families are Begoniaceae (begonia family) with 1400 species and Cucurbitaceae (gourd family) with 825 species.

The large families of Cucurbitales include several economically important plants. Specifically, the Cucurbitaceae are responsible for some food species, such as squash, pumpkin (both from Cucurbita), watermelon (Citrullus vulgaris), melon and cucumber (both Cucumis). The Begoniaceae are known for their horticultural species, of which there are over 130.

[[Cucurbitaceae]]

CATEGORIES: Cucurbitaceae

[[Nachos]]

CATEGORIES: Snack foods

Nachos are a snack food made with tortilla chips and cheese. Sometimes they have jalapeños, sauce, beans, guacamole or meat on them.

Ignacio "Nacho" Anaya created nachos at the Victory Club in 1940 when Mamie Finan, a regular customer, asked if Anaya could bring her and three other women a different snack than usual. Anaya went to the kitchen and spotted freshly fried pieces of corn tortillas. In a moment of culinary inspiration, he added melted cheese and pickled jalapeño strips. After tasting the snack Anaya created, Finan asked what it was called. Anaya responded, "Well, I guess we can just call them Nacho's Special." The dish was so popular, the owner of the Victory Club, Roberto de los Santos, put Nacho's Special on the menu and the snack quickly spread throughout the world. When the Victory Club closed in 1961, Anaya opened his own restaurant, Nacho's.

[[Unicycle]]

CATEGORIES: Human-powered vehicles, Cycling

A unicycle is a pedal vehicle. It is like a bicycle, but it has only one wheel. It has a seat and pedals, but no chain or gears. There is no handlebar, it is steered by gripping the seat with the legs and twisting the body.  A rider keeps their balance by moving their arms, and controlling their speed. It is usually used for acting and performing. A unicycle is more expensive than a cheap bicycle, because unicycles are far less common.

There are two kinds of unicycles; giraffe unicycles and traditional unicycles. Giraffe unicycles are much taller than traditional unicycles, and use a chain so that the performer's legs do not have to stretch very far. Giraffe unicycles are mostly used by performers in circuses.  

Unicycles are often used while the performer is simultaneously juggling or plate spinning. To do this, performers usually rock back and forth on the unicycle. This is called "idling". It lets the performer pay attention to what they are doing in their hands, instead of to the ground in front of them. To "idle" a unicycle, performers usually press one foot down, anchoring it in the bottom position of the wheel. This foot both provides support and completes the rocking motion that is necessary to keep the unicycle balanced.

Many other tricks can be done when riding a unicycle.  This includes going backwards, riding up and down steps, pedaling with only one foot, hopping in place, wheel-walking (putting the feet on the tire instead of on the pedals) and riding over obstacles.

The Victoria line is part of the London Underground network. It is a deep-level underground metro line that runs from Brixton in south London to Walthamstow Central in the north-east. It started running in 1968. On the Tube map it is shown with a light blue color. It is the fourth busiest line on the London Underground network. It is the only line on the Underground, other than the two-stop Waterloo & City line, which is completely underground. The only section of track to come above ground is the route to the depot from Seven Sisters to Northumberland Park.

The Underground line has hump-backed stations which allow trains to store gravitational potential energy as they arrive and to then use this energy as they leave the stations. The stations are on top of small hills, or humps. As the train travels up the hill to the station its weight helps it to slow down. As the train leaves the station it travels down the hill, with gravity helping the train to speed up. This saves 5% energy and makes the trains run 9% faster. Each new platform built for the Victoria Line is 132.6 metres long. Around 200 million people use the Victoria line each year.

[[Dinoflagellate]]

CATEGORIES: Alveolata, Algae, Fossils

The dinoflagellates are a large group of flagellate protists. About half are photosynthetic, the rest are mostly heterotroph predators of other protists. The ones which are photosynthetic are sometimes loosely called 'algae'; the one which are predators are sometimes loosely called 'protozoa'. 

They have been classified as an order, a class and a phylum by different authors. Active research is being done on their relationships.

Most are marine plankton, but they are common in fresh water habitats as well. Their populations are distributed depending on temperature, salinity, or depth. The group includes many symbionts and bioluminescent species.

About 1,555 species of free-living marine dinoflagellates are currently described. The latest estimates suggest a total of 2,294 living dinoflagellate species, which includes marine, freshwater and parasitic dinoflagellates.

[[Epiphyte]]

CATEGORIES: Epiphytes

An epiphyte is a plant which grows on another plant, without being a parasite. The term is also be used for bacteria, fungi, lichens and mosses which grow on plants. However, most epiphytes (89%) are flowering plants; and about a third of all ferns are epiphytes.  

An epiphyte gets its moisture and nutrients from the air and rain, and sometimes from debris accumulating around it. The ones in the temperate zone are often mosses, liverworts, lichens and algae, and in the tropics ferns, cacti, orchids, and bromeliads.

Sometimes such plants are called air plants, because they do not root in soil. This is misleading though, as there are many aquatic epiphytes as well. Epiphytic organisms only take support from the host; they are usually not parasites. Parasitic and semi-parasitic plants, like the mistletoe are not true epiphytes.

Epiphytes usually use photosynthesis to get energy; often they have adapted their leaves to be able to capture rainwater (and moisture from the air) if they are not aquatic.

Epiphytes are important for other species too, certain frogs live in the water reservoir of epiphytes.

[[Miniature sheet]]

CATEGORIES: Postage stamps

A miniature sheet or souvenir sheet is a small group of postage stamps still attached to the sheet on which they were printed.

[[Loon]]

CATEGORIES: Birds

A loon is a bird that lives on water. It is  in the order Gaviiformes. This is an order of aquatic birds, the loons or divers and their closest extinct relatives.

Loons are the size of a large duck or a small goose.  Loons can be hard to find because they are shy around people.  The name "loon" is from the Scandinavian word for "clumsy". Loons are the state bird of Minnesota. Loons are found in most parts of North America (there are five North American  species) and northern Eurasia.  They enjoy cool climates in the summer and migrate to ocean coasts in the winter.

Loons can dive up to 200 feet underwater for food.  Their bodies are shaped for diving.  To dive better, they have solid bones (most birds' bones are hollow) and feet placed far back for swimming under the water. They have black (or grey)-and-white heads, pale breasts, and striped back feathers. 

Loons can lay up to two eggs. The females are brownish in color which helps them blend into their surroundings.  Both the male and female parent take turns sitting on the eggs.  After hatching, they fly south when the weather gets cool.  The young loons spend three years in the south before returning to the north.

They are best known for their loud, trumpeting call. They also make melodic, wailing or laughing sounds.  Loons communicate to each other through their sounds.  They also communicate with humans and other animals through dance.  Loons warn others to stay away from their nests by dancing on the water.  Loons are protective parents and will dance to exhaustion and death to protect their eggs.  Raccoons, gulls, and skunks have been known to devour loon eggs.   

Loons eat fish like sunfish, perch, and bullheads.  Loons do not chew their food.  They have elastic throats that allow the loon to swallow their food whole.  When they swallow fish, their throat expands to the size of the fish they eat so they do not choke.    

Scientists band, or tag loons to try to understand more about them. Their life style is similar to the grebes, but they are a different group of birds.

[[Crossbow]]

CATEGORIES: Archery, Weapons

The crossbow, or arbalest, is a bow which consists of a bow-like arc called prod and cross-wise body called stock and trigger mechanism. The crossbow is an invention in which the stock, a piece of wood is mounted on two other crossing pieces. Crossbows shoot short arrows called bolts which are similar to arrows.  The crossbow was first created by the Chinese people in circa 6 B.C. The Greeks invented crossbow separately in 4th century B.C. The Romans called the weapon arcuballista. Crossbow was a very popular weapon in the Middle Ages as it was strong and accurate and could be used as a sharpshooter weapon.  The Arabs call crossbow qaws Ferengi, "Frankish bow", as the Crusaders used crossbow a lot.  A good crossbow can shoot the bolt with such immense power that it may pierce armour. Against unarmoured light opponents, even a single bolt may be lethal.

Compared to the ordinary bow, the crossbows have good and bad sides to them. They fire much stronger and much more accurately than ordinary bows, and shooting accurately with a crossbow is easier to learn than shooting with an ordinary bow. On the other hand, because the prod is short and therefore very stiff, a crossbow will take much longer time to load, and a crossbow does not have as good accurate range than a longbow.  Many crossbows have crank or windlass mechanisms to pull the string in drawn position. Also many crossbows do have safety mechanisms to prevent an accidental shot.

Crossbow shooting is today a popular sport.

Pakistan is the second largest Muslim country in terms of population (behind Indonesia). Pakistan is the only Muslim country known to have nuclear weapons. Pakistan is also an important member of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC).

Pakistan is an active member of the United Nations. Pakistan had some problems with its Foreign relations. Pakistan's relations with its neighbor, India is not good. Both countries have been fighting over the disputed territory of Kashmir,over which they have fought two wars. Pakistan has also had difficult relations with neighbors Afghanistan and Iran. Pakistan has had a long and good relationship with the China. Pakistan has interest over the Persian Gulf and has wide-ranging bilateral relations with the United States and other Western countries.

Pakistan distrusted the Soviet Union during much of the Cold War. Because of this Pakistan had strong relations with both the United States of America and the People's Republic of China. 

Pakistan was a member of the American-sponsored CENTO and SEATO military alliances. Pakistans' alliance with the United States was especially close after the Soviets invaded the neighboring country of Afghanistan. In 1964, Pakistan signed the Regional Cooperation for Development (RCD) Pact with Turkey and Iran, when all three countries were closely allied with the U.S., and as neighbors of the Soviet Union, wary of perceived Soviet expansionism. To this day, Pakistan has had a close relationship with Turkey. RCD became defunct after the Iranian Revolution, and a Pakistani-Turkish initiative led to the founding of the Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO) in 1985. For several years, Pakistan's relations with the Republic of India had been gradually improving, which opened up Pakistan's foreign policy to issues beyond security.

[[Stellar precession]]

CATEGORIES: Astronomical phenomena

Stellar precession is one of the ways the stars slowly move across the sky when seen from the Earth. The best-known thing this causes is making the north star's place in the sky slowly change over thousands of years. It is caused by the Sun's gravity pulling the Earth's poles toward itself. Because the Earth's poles are tilted at an angle of 23.42 degrees from straight up in relation to its orbit, this causes the North Pole to seem to point at different places in the sky. While the orientation of the Earth with respect to the stars changes, the axial tilt remains constant. 

Although it takes a very long time for the pole to make a whole circle in the sky (almost 26,000 years), even over the time period that humans have had writing, this has made a big difference in what star is seen as the north star. When the ancient Egyptians built the pyramids about 4,000 years ago, they used the stars to make the edges line up with north and south. However, they did not use the same north star that we do because Earth's North Pole pointed at a different star than it does today. 

Astronomers have known about this movement for a very long time, calling it the precession of the equinoxes. Most people think that Hipparchus discovered it in ancient Greece in about 130 BC, but some people think that even the ancient Egyptians may have known about it.

[[Harem]]

CATEGORIES: Islamic culture

Harem means the women and the place where they live in a polygynous household. Most men are not allowed in there. The word harem comes from the Turkish word haram, meaning a sacred, forbidden place. Harems were meant for the royal upbringing of the future wives of noble and royal men. These women would be educated so that they were ready to appear in public as a royal wife. No forms of sexual activity took place inside of harems.

In the west people thought that harems (especially those in the Ottoman Empire) were brothels full of women who gave themselves up to please rich men. 

In modern terms the word maybe used to describe a group of admiring women attracted to one man.

[[Toronto subway and RT]]

CATEGORIES: Toronto Transit Commission, Rapid transit systems, Rail transport in Canada

The Toronto subway and RT is the main rapid transit (RT) railway system in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is run by the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC). Since the first part under Yonge Street opened in 1954 with 12 stations, the system has grown to be Canada's biggest rapid transit rail system. It has four lines and 69 stations on 68.3 km of track. The subway system is used very often and has the most number of passengers of any system in Canada. It has an average of 948,100 passenger trips each weekday (as of 2010).

The system is was made bigger on the western part of the Yonge–University Line with new tracks and stations being made north to York University, Steeles Avenue, and Vaughan Corporate Centre in York Region. The Government of Ontario said on March 23, 2006 that it will give $670 million for this new work, which is less than one-third of the total money needed. The new track is about 8.6 km long and was built with six new stations: Downsview Park, Finch West, York University, Pioneer Village, Highway 407, and the Vaughan Metropolitan Centre. It was expected to cost about $2 billion.

[[Tar]]

CATEGORIES: Materials, Hydrocarbons

Tar is a sticky black liquid made of thick oil. It is a natural substance, oozing out of the ground in places like the La Brea tar pits. Usually it is made by heating coal inside a chemical apparatus.

Most tar is produced from coal as a byproduct of coke production, but it can also be produced from petroleum, peat or wood. The "destructive distillation" of a ton of coal can produce 700 kg of coke, 100 litres of liquor ammonia, 50 litres of coal tar and 400 m3 of coal gas.

It used to be one of the products of gasworks. Tar made from coal or petroleum is considered toxic. It causes cancer because of its high benzene content. In low concentrations, however, tar is used as a medicine on the skin. 

Tar kilns are dry distillation ovens, used in Scandinavia for producing tar from wood. They were built close to the forest, from limestone or from more primitive holes in the ground. The bottom is sloped into an outlet hole, to allow the tar to come out. The wood is split to dimensions of a finger and stacked densely, and finally covered tight with dirt and moss to stop air entering. On top of this, a fire is stacked and lit. After a few hours, the tar starts to pour out, and continues to do so for a few days.

[[Toronto Transit Commission]]

CATEGORIES: Toronto Transit Commission

The Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) runs the public transport system that has buses, streetcars, subways, and rapid transit lines in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Started in 1954, the TTC has grown to three subway lines and an elevated rapid transit line with a total of 75 stations, as well as 149 surface routes (buses and streetcars). Of these 149 routes 148 make 243 connections with a subway or rapid transit station during weekday rush hours.

The TTC operates the third most used urban public transport system in North America (after the New York City Transit Authority and the Mexico City Metro).

The TTC also runs a door-to-door (they pick people up at home, the shops or work, and take them anywhere they wish to go) system for people with physical disabilities known as Wheel-Trans; about 5,500 trips are made by this service daily. This service costs the same as any other trip on the TTC even though it is door-to-door. The TTC had 11,235 people working for it in 2007.

[[Viscosity]]

CATEGORIES: Fluid mechanics

Viscosity is a physical property of fluids. It shows resistance to flow. In a simple example, water has a low viscosity, as it is "thin". Syrup and tar, on the other hand, have a high viscosity, as they are "thick". A way to test for viscosity is the speed at which the substance runs down a slope. Syrup would reach the bottom very slowly, and water would be much quicker.

There are two types of viscosity: dynamic viscosity, measured in pascal seconds, and kinematic viscosity, measured in metres per second squared.

Viscosity is used as a way to predict when volcanoes erupt. When the lava comes out very thickly (viscous), there is more chance that it will erupt violently. This is because the lava has a hard time getting out and may burst out when it can. If the lava is thin (low viscosity), then it just flows out like water.

The word viscous comes from the Latin root viscum, meaning sticky.

[[Passenger]]

CATEGORIES: Transport

A passenger is a term that is used for a person who travels in a vehicle, but not the driver or a person working in the vehicle.

[[Additions to Daniel]]

CATEGORIES: Old Testament books

The Additions to Daniel are three chapters that have been held by the Roman Catholic, Eastern Catholic, Oriental Orthodox and Eastern Orthodox churches since the council of Rome (380). These books were removed in most Christian Bibles since Martin Luther's decision to include them in his bible as "Apocrypha" due to the supposed contradiction of the Hebrew Old Testament (the Apostles and Early Church onward using the Septuagint). The chapters are listed in Article VI of the Thirty-Nine Articles of the Church of England as good but not sacred reading. Most Protestant Bibles do not have these chapters because most Protestant churches believe these chapters are apocryphal.

The Additions to Daniel are not found in the Hebrew or Aramaic text of Daniel. These stories are in the Greek Septuagint and a translation by the writer Theodotion. However, most Protestant Bibles use only the text in the Hebrew and Aramaic manuscripts, so they do not have these chapters.

The additions are:

[[Ice cube]]

CATEGORIES: Water

Ice cubes are small pieces of ice that are often cubes. These pieces are sometimes used to cool drinks. Ice cubes are used in mixed drinks, when the drink has the words "on the rocks."

Ice cubes are made by filling a tray with water and putting it in a freezer. Many freezers also have an icemaker. Icemakers make ice cubes and put them in a bin. After that, they can be put in a glass.

Ice cubes are also made commercially and sold in large amounts. These ice cubes are usually cylindrical, and might have holes through the center. Commercially made ice cubes are very clear, as the water doesn't have much air dissolved in it.

Ice cubes can also be crushed into different-shaped flakes, which some people think makes some kinds of cocktails look better. Crushed ice is also used to cool a drink or other liquid quickly because the speed of cooling depends on the amount and average radius of the ice particles.

[[Machete]]

[[2101 Adonis]]

CATEGORIES: Asteroids

2101 Adonis was one of the first near-Earth asteroids to be found.  It was found by Eugene Delporte in 1936 and named after Adonis, the beautiful youth with whom the goddess Venus fell in love. Adonis is thought to measure about 1 km in diameter.

In the close approach that led to the first time it was found, not enough sightings could be made to find out it's orbit, and Adonis was lost until 1977 when it was found once again by Charles T. Kowal.

Adonis was the second Apollo asteroid to be found (after 1862 Apollo itself). It may be a dead comet, and may be the source of some meteor showers. 

It comes within 30 Gm of the Earth six times in the 21st century, the nearest being 5.3 Gm in 2036.

[[1566 Icarus]]

CATEGORIES: Asteroids

1566 Icarus is an Apollo asteroid (a sub-class of near-Earth asteroid). At its closest approach to the Sun (perihelion) it is closer to the Sun than Mercury. In its orbit it crosses the orbits of Mercury, Venus and Mars. It is named after Icarus of Greek mythology, who flew too close to the Sun. The asteroid was found in 1949 by Walter Baade.

Icarus makes a close approach to Earth at gaps of 9, 19, or 38 years. Sometimes, it comes as close as 6.4 Gm (16 lunar distances and 4 million miles), as it did on June 14, 1968. The last close approach was in 1996, at 15.1 Gm, about 40 times as far as the Moon. The most recent close approach was on June 16, 2015, 8.1 Gm (5 million miles).

In 1967, Paul Sandorff of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology gave his students the task of making a plan to destroy Icarus, if it was going to hit the Earth. This plan is known as Project Icarus (which was the basis for the 1979 science fiction film Meteor, starring Sean Connery).

[[3200 Phaethon]]

CATEGORIES: Asteroids

3200 Phaethon, sometimes incorrectly spelt Phaeton, is an Apollo asteroid and a dead comet.

It was announced on 14 October 1983 in IAUC 3878, with optical confirmation that it looks like an asteroid. It was the first asteroid to be found by a spacecraft. It measures 5.10 km in diameter.

Phaethon approaches the Sun closer than any other numbered asteroid. Its perihelion (closest approach to the Sun) is only 0.140 AU – less than half Mercury's perihelion distance. It is a Mercury-, Venus-, Earth- and Mars-crosser. The surface temperature at perihelion could reach ~1025 K, or 1400 F. For this reason, it was named after the Greek myth of Phaëton, son of the sun god Helios.

Phaethon approached to 18.1 Gm on 10 December 2007. It will draw nearer in 2017, 2050, 2060,  and closer still on 14 December 2093, passing within 0.0198 AU (3.0  Gm).

[[Minor planet designation]]

CATEGORIES: Minor planets

Minor planet designations are number-name combinations given by the Minor Planet Center, a part of the IAU. They are used for dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies such as asteroids, but not comets. They are given to a body once its orbit is secured, and are unrelated to provisional designations, which are given when an object is found. 

The two parts of a formal designation are 

It looks like this: (number) Name, for example (90377) Sedna or (55636) 2002 TX. The brackets are now often removed, as in 90377 Sedna, according to what the astronomer wants. In practice, however, for any reasonably well-known object the number is mostly a catalogue entry, and the name or provisional designation is generally used in place of the formal designation: Sedna, 2002 TX.

The rule for moons of minor planets, such as the formal designation (87) Sylvia I Romulus for the asteroid moon Romulus, is an extension of the Roman numeral convention that had been used, on and off, for the moons of the planets since Galileo's time.  

Comets are also managed by the Minor Planet Center, but use a different cataloguing system.

[[Saddle]]

CATEGORIES: Horse riding

A saddle is like a seat for a rider, which is held to an animal's back by a belly strap called a girth. The most common type is the equestrian saddle made for a horse. Saddles have been made for camels and other animals. The earliest saddles were simple pads fixed with a surcingle seen by 800 BC, with the saddle tree coming into use about 200 BC, and paired stirrups by 322 AD Saddles in use today, date back to the 1700s. Today, modern saddles come in different styles, designed for different equestrian activities. They need careful fit for both the rider and the horse. Proper saddle care can extend the useful life of a saddle, often for many years.

The two most common saddle types used for horse riding are the English saddle and the Western saddle. The English saddle is used for horse sports like show jumping, dressage, and eventing. It is also used for horse showing. It has less leather and is lighter than most Western saddles. 

The Western saddle is used for horse activities where the rider needs more support than in and english saddle. It is also used for showing,  barrel racing,  rodeo, and many other sports. The biggest difference is it has a horn on the front, and a higher cantle. This was used originally for tying cattle off when working, so the ranchers could brand or work with the cow. It's now used more widely, in barrel racing it's used for support, in roping events, it's still used to tie cattle. 

The there are many different types of English and Western saddles. All are designed for a specific purpose. So while they might look different, they all help the rider for the sport or activity for which they were designed. For example, a rider would not want to jump in a Western saddle because the horn would make it hard for them to stay in the correct position over the jump. A rider would not want to work cows in a jumping saddle because they would not have a horn and because the Western saddle puts the rider in a better position for working cows.

[[Bridle]]

CATEGORIES: Horse riding

A bridle is a piece of equipment used to direct and control a horse. The bridle is the headgear that holds a bit which goes in the mouth of a horse, and also the reins that are joined to the bit.

Bridles are usually made of leather. They are made of different parts which are buckled together. The headpiece, also called a crownpiece, goes behind the horse's ears. The browband is placed across the horse's forehead. The throatlach goes behind the horse's cheek. The cheekpieces extend across the horse's cheek and attach to the bit. The noseband goes across the horse's nose and under its chin. Some bridles do not have a noseband. Others have special nosebands designed to prevent the horse from opening its mouth too widely and crossing its jaw. Sometimes, a strap called a martingale is attached to the noseband.

A bridle without a bit uses a noseband to control a horse, and is called a hackamore, or a bitless bridle. Bitless bridles work by pressure and leverage on the horse's nose and chin groove. Bitless bridles can be useful for horses that have problems with their mouths. It is more difficult to turn a horse using a bitless bridle, and bitless bridles can provide tremendous leverage and stopping power.

[[Square metre]]

CATEGORIES: Units of area

The  square meter is the SI-derived unit of area. It has a symbol m² (33A1 in Unicode). It is defined as the area of a square whose sides measure exactly one metre.  The square metre is derived from the SI base unit of the metre, which in turn is defined as the length of the path travelled by light in absolute vacuum during a time interval of 1 of a second.

Adding SI prefixes creates multiples and submultiples. However, as the unit is squared, the order of magnitude difference between units doubles from their comparable linear units.  For example, a kilometre is one thousand times the length of a metre, but a square kilometre is one million times the area of a square metre.

A "square metre" is not the same thing as a "metre square"  - although it is true that exactly 1 square metre is exactly 1 meter square. But that only works for the numbers 1 and 0; no others.

For example, a square that is 2 metres long and 2 metres wide has 4 square metres of area.

But a square that is 4 metres squared would have 4 metres on each side. This means it would have 16 square metres of area.

That is, (4m)2 is 4 meters squared, whereas 4m2 is 4 square meters.

As of October 22, 2007, the countdown was based on votes, charts, ringtones, downloads, radio airplay, and streams, meaning that the video that the user requested might not have been the number one video of the day. The show mainly aired from Monday to Thursday for an hour, but the scheduling and length of the show has changed over the years. Even though the word "Live" is in the show's title, a lot of the show's episodes have actually been pre-recorded.

On September 15, 2008, it was announced that TRL would be over and it was later replaced by another show. A special, three-hour finale was aired on November 16, 2008 at 8 p.m.

Until 2010, a local version of TRL was still running in Italy on MTV.

[[Pareto efficiency]]

CATEGORIES: Welfare economics

Multi-criteria optimization, or multiobjective optimization is a way of solving a mathematical or economic problem where many different parameters need to be changed to get one of the best possible solutions to the problem. The result of this is called Pareto efficiency, named after Vilfredo Pareto, who first used it in his studies. 

In welfare economics, the idea of Pareto efficiency is very simple: If there is no way of improving the situation of one person, without making that of another person worse, the solution found is Pareto-efficient. 

If we look at what the economy produces, we might say it is on its Pareto Frontier or Production Possibility Frontier, meaning that it is making (or "producing") all it can with the things it has (such as machines, labour, land and ideas -- all called resources or factors of production). If this is the case, making more of one thing would mean making less of another; the resources are already being used to full capacity, so making more of one thing will take resources away from making another.

Just because something is Pareto efficient, it doesn't mean it is fair or "equitable". Even though no-one could be made better off without making someone else worse off, it is possible that one person owns all of the world's things. To make anyone else better off, some would have to be taken away from this person, making them worse off.

[[Proper motion]]

CATEGORIES: Astronomical phenomena

Proper motion is the name for the way the stars seem to slowly move relative to each other when seen from Earth. 

The movement is caused by the fact that all stars (including the Sun) are moving through space at hundreds of kilometres per second. However, because they are so far away, it takes a long time for us to see that they have moved, and even then it takes a powerful telescope to see the difference. Because of this, for a long time, most people thought that the stars did not move at all. Even the ancient Greeks, who knew a lot about the stars and discovered some of the other ways they move, such as stellar precession, did not discover proper motion (although they probably suspected it). 

Proper motion was not proved to exist until 1718 when Edmond Halley noticed the stars Sirius, Arcturus and Aldebaran had moved from the places they were in star charts that Hipparchus had drawn around 130 BC. However, even after more than 1,800 years, they had moved less than half a degree.

Proper motion is useful to astronomers in figuring out how far away a star is from Earth because stars that are close usually have a larger proper motion (meaning they move faster across the sky) than stars that are farther away. For example, Barnard's star has the largest proper motion of any star, moving 10.3 arcseconds per year. This is equal to one quarter of a degree, or half the diameter of the Moon in the sky, in only 87 years. It is the second-closest star to the Earth at 5.98 light years away. Also, eight of the ten stars with the biggest proper motions are less than 15 light years away.

[[Origin of birds]]

CATEGORIES: Coelurosaurs, Birds, Evolutionary biology, Fossils

The origin of birds is one of the most interesting questions in palaeontology and evolution. Birds evolved from theropod dinosaurs during the Mesozoic era.

Thomas Henry Huxley ("Darwin's bulldog"), who was a comparative anatomist, made a study of this nearly 150 years ago. He compared the first fossil bird, Archaeopteryx, with a small theropod dinosaur, Compsognathus. They are two fossils from the same place and time: the Solnhofen limestone in Bavaria, Germany. The strata come from the end of the Jurassic period, about 144 million years ago.

Huxley's papers on Archaeopteryx, and the origin of birds, were of great interest then, and still are. He showed that the two fossils were almost identical, except for the front limbs and feathers of Archaeopteryx.

He united reptiles and birds under the title of Sauropsida, and thought that birds had evolved from small carnivorous dinosaurs.

[[Reddit]]

CATEGORIES: Websites

Reddit is a website where people share links to articles, media and other things on the web. The website is organized into "subreddits", communities within the Reddit community to discuss certain topics or to look at specific content. The posted links can be voted on, and the links with most votes are displayed on the front page of the website. Reddit was founded in 2005 by Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian, and is also available in other languages. People in the Reddit community call themselves "redditors". Some examples of subreddits are /r/Pics, /r/Aww, /r/FakeHistory, /r/WritingPrompts, /r/Showerthoughts, /r/todayilearned. Subreddits are directed towards all sort of things, like educational, funny, cute pictures of animals, intellectual nonsense, internet memes, and more.

Reddit has occasionally been the topic of controversy due to the presence of subreddits devoted to explicit or controversial material, including subreddits r/Creepshots and r/jailbait.

[[Bryde's whale]]

CATEGORIES: Baleen whales

Bryde's whale is a baleen whale. It is a small group of several species which look alike and used to be lumped together. The whale can grow from 12.5 m (41 ft) to 14 m (46 ft) long and a weight of 16–18.5 tonnes, with the female larger than the male. 

Until the 1950s it was considered a single species, Balaenoptera brydei. It is now known that there are several almost identical species. Balaenoptera edeni and Balaenoptera omurai are two other species in the group. 

There has also been confusion between the Sei whale, Balaenoptera borealis, and the Bryde's whale as they look alike and are the same size. Bryde's whale is unique in having three long ridges on its head that go from between the eyes towards the blowhole. All other rorquals have just one. The Bryde's whales skin varies from black to dark grey.

The whale was named after Johan Bryde, who built South Africa's first factory to process whales. They are found in tropical and sub-tropical waters. There seem to be several different types of Bryde's whales, but it has not yet been decided if they are different species, or a sub-species. In particular, B. brydei and B. edeni may be sister species.

These two types of tournament are different. All golf tournaments meet are of the first type, but match play tournaments are in the second. Football (soccer) leagues like the Premier League are tournaments in the second sense, but not the first, having matches spread across many places over a period of up to a year. Many tournaments meet both definitions; for example, the Wimbledon tennis championship.

[[Longshore drift]]

CATEGORIES: Wave physics, Environmental issues, Erosion

Longshore drift is the process of the ocean currents forcing sand and other material down a beach. 

The material is first pulled into the currents by the backwash (the water going out to sea) and is then pushed back up the beach by the swash (the water going onto the beach). Longshore drift always moves in the direction of the main wind. If longshore drift continues for a long time, beaches can be changed quite a bit. The changes depend on the details, and vary from place to place. Longshore drift is the net (average) movement of sand grains across a beach in a zig-zag motion.

There are many inexpensive and effective ways of controlling longshore drift. The most common method is groynes (wooden walls that the sand builds up against). Some people dislike groynes because they interfere with walking along the beach, and the look of the beach.

[[Topological space]]

CATEGORIES: Geometry, Mathematics

A topological space is a space studied in topology, the mathematics of the structure of shapes. Roughly, it is a set of things (called points) along with a way to know which things are close together.

More precisely, a topological space has a certain kind of set, called open sets. Open sets are important because they allow one to talk about points near another point, called a neighbourhood of the point. A neighbourhood of a point is simply an open set containing that point. If one did not have the concept of open sets, one cannot define neighbourhoods in a good way. If one tries to define a neighbourhood of a point as any set containing that point, it might just include that point and that point only, not any points near it, or points far away.

We also have the concept of closed sets, which are complements of open sets. That is, all of the points not belonging to a certain open sets forms a closed set.

Open sets must follow certain rules so that they match our ideas of nearness. The union of any number of open sets must be open, and the union of a finite number of closed sets must be closed. (The second rule only works for a finite number of closed sets. That is because in many cases a set containing a single point is closed. Any set is made of points. If the second rule applied to an infinite number of closed sets, then every set would be closed.) As a special case, the set containing every point is both open and closed. The set containing no points is also both open and closed.

A set of points can have many different definitions of what an open set is. One can think of only certain sets as open, or more sets as open. One might even consider every set to be open. The same set with different definitions of open sets form different topological spaces.

[[Algorithm]]

CATEGORIES: Algorithms, Recursion

An algorithm is a step procedure to solve logical and mathematical problems. 

A recipe is a good example of an algorithm because it says what must be done, step by step. It takes inputs (ingredients) and produces an output (the completed dish).

The words 'algorithm' and 'algorism' come from the name of a Persian mathematician called Al-Khwārizmī (Persian: خوارزمی, c. 780–850).

Informally, an algorithm can be called a "list of steps". Algorithms can be written in ordinary language, and that may be all a person needs.

In computing, an algorithm is a precise list of operations that could be done by a Turing machine.

For the purpose of computing, algorithms are written in pseudocode, flow charts, or programming languages.

[[Musket]]

CATEGORIES: 1500s, Firearms

A musket is a muzzleloading, smoothbore firearm, which is meant to be fired from the shoulder. 

The musket is the weapon that replaced the arquebus, and was then replaced by the rifle. But the word musket is also used to describe a number of different weapons including:

Muskets were made for use by infantry. A soldier armed with a musket was called a musketman or musketeer. In the 1500's, soldiers armed with a heavy arquebus, called a musket, supported the arquebusiers and the pikemen. By the start of 1700's, a lighter type of musket took over from the arquebus. When the bayonet was added, there was no longer a need for pikemen, and almost all infantry soldiers became musketeers. The first musket made in the united States was the Springfield Model 1795 Musket. In the 1800's, better ammunition and ways of firing the gun, meant that rifling was practical for military use, and the rifled musket became common. A few years later, the use of cartridges, breechloading, and multiple rounds of ammunition meant the "rifled musket" gave way to the rifle, and "muskets" were no longer used.

Musket calibres ranged from 0.5 to 0.8. A smoothbore musket, firing at a single target, was only accurate to about 50 to 70. Rifled muskets in the 1850's were much better, able to hit a man sized target at up to 500. The advantage of this longer distance was shown at the Battle of Four Lakes, where Springfield Model 1855 rifled muskets killed Indian warriors before they could get close enough with their smoothbore muskets. However, in the Italian War of 1859, French forces were able to defeat the longer range of Austrian rifle muskets by quick, small attacks and bayonet attacks at close range.

[[ALPHA Collaboration]]

[[Roman à clef]]

CATEGORIES: Books

Roman à clef (said like it rhymes with "a don a day") means "novel with a key" in French.  It is a phrase used for talking about literature and movies.  A roman à clef is a type of story that's true for the most part except for details like the name of the main character.  The "key" part of the meaning–what someone needs to unlock the real story–changes from book to book.  For some books it is knowing that the main character is really a famous person.  For others it is knowing that the main character is really the author.

Authors usually write these types of stories (instead of telling the whole truth) to talk about a controversy or what happened during a crime so that the people involved can't sue them.  A couple of movies that are written like this are Citizen Kane (a movie about a man a lot like William Randolph Hearst) and Dreamgirls (a movie about a Motown group a lot like The Supremes).

Because it comes from French, the plural of roman à clef is romans à clef.

[[Tetraphobia]]

CATEGORIES: Superstitions, Phobias

Tetraphobia is a fear of the number 4.  It is a superstition found most often in East Asian areas, for example China, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan.

The Chinese word for four (四, pinyin: sì, jyutping: sei3), sounds very similar to the word for death (死, pinyin: sǐ, jyutping: sei2).

Chinese people take care not to use the number 4 during important holidays, or if someone in the family is sick. Numbers such as 14, 24, and so on, are not used because they also have the number 4 in them. Buildings sometimes do not have floors with these numbers, apartments and hotels do not have rooms with number 4, 14, 24 and so on. Table number 4, 14, 24, may be often left out in wedding dinners or other social activities in these countries. Where there are a lot of apartment buildings, buildings that should be 4, 14, 24, are called 3A, 13A, 23A, and so on.

In Hong Kong, some apartments such as Vision City and The Arch do not have the floors from 40 to 49. Immediately above 39/F is 50/F, leading many who do not know about tetraphobia to think that some floors are missing.

The Chinese start numbering their military aircraft with the number 5, such as the fighter plane "Shenyang J-5". The Taiwanese and the South Korean navies do not use the number 4 when giving flag numbers to their ships.

In cities where East Asian and Western cultures come together, like Hong Kong and Singapore, it is possible in some buildings that both 13 and 14 are left out as floor numbers, along with all the other 4s.

In Korea, tetraphobia is not as important, but the floor number 4 is almost always left out in hospitals. In other buildings, the fourth floor is sometimes named "F" (Four) instead of "4" in elevators. Apartment numbers with a lot of the number 4 (such as 404) are hard to sell, and often they are not worth as much money.

[[5145 Pholus]]

CATEGORIES: Asteroids

5145 Pholus is a Centaur (minor planetoid) of the solar system running in a stretched orbit, with a perihelion (closest approach to the Sun) less than  Saturn's and aphelion (farthest approach from the Sun) farther than Neptune's. Close approaches of the object are not common: it has not come within one astronomical unit (about 150 million km) of a planet since 764 BC, and will not again until 5290. Astronomers think that Pholus started out as a Kuiper belt object.

It was found by David L. Rabinowitz, then of the University of Arizona's Spacewatch Project, and named after Pholus, the brother of the mythological Chiron, after which 2060 Chiron was named to follow the tradition of naming this class of outer planet crossing objects after Centaurs.

Pholus was the second Centaur type asteroid to be found and was quickly found to be very red in color. Because it's very red, it is sometimes called "Big Red". Astronomers think the color is because of organic compounds on its surface.

Unlike the first Centaur, 2060 Chiron, Pholus has shown no signs of cometary activity.

Astronomers think that Pholus' diameter is about 185±16 km.

Henry had an affair with Elizabeth Blount while he was married to Catherine of Aragon. He was the only illegitimate (a person whose parents are not married) child of Henry VIII that was confirmed by Henry VIII to be his own son. Henry had no other living sons during Fitzroy's lifetime and so Fitzroy was considered as a potential heir to the throne. 

He died in 1536 from a lung disease, probably Tuberculosis, one year before his half-brother Edward VI of England was born.

[[Kleptomania]]

CATEGORIES: Impulse control disorders

Kleptomania (κλέπτειν, "to steal", μανία, "mania") is an impulse control disorder. It is mental disorder with a frequent urge of stealing. Kleptomaniacs often steal many of the same thing and hoard, throw away or give away the things they steal. Some may not be aware that they have committed the theft. It is often found in people who have other mental disorders, such as depression, panic attacks, bulimia nervosa, anorexia nervosa, obsessive-compulsive disorder and drug addiction. The condition is more common in females, and especially those with bulimia.

Australia's Youth teams play in the ASEAN Youth Tournaments. Australia has been the Oceania Football Confederation champion four times, and has been at three World Cup finals tournaments, in 1974, 2006 and 2010. FIFA Rankings show the Australian National Football team is one of the strongest countries in Asia, and is currently ranked 20th in the world by FIFA. Australia made it to the round of 16 in the 2006 World Cup held in Germany and were knocked out in controversial circumstances by eventual champions Italy. Australia's 2010 world cup finals campaign was also blighted by controversial and mostly incorrect refereeing decisions and lead to the teams eventual elimination in the group stages despite a 2-1 win over a higher ranked Serbian team and a draw against Ghana. Australia will now prepare for the Asian cup in early 2011 and the 2014 world cup qualification.

[[Beta decay]]

CATEGORIES: Nuclear physics

In nuclear physics, beta decay is a type of radioactive decay where a beta particle (an electron or a positron) is made and sent away, or emitted. When it is an electron, it is called beta minus, and changes a neutron into a proton. When it is a positron, it is beta plus and changes a proton into a neutron. The weak force makes Beta decay possible.

[[Beta particle]]

CATEGORIES: Nuclear physics, Chemistry

Beta particles are electrons or positrons emitted by some radioactive nuclei such as potassium-40 or carbon-14 (which becomes nitrogen-14). The beta particles emitted are a form of ionizing radiation sometimes called beta rays. Henri Becquerel and Ernest Rutherford discovered beta rays in the 1890s. Beta particles are made by beta decay. When scientists write it in an equation, they are use the Greek letter beta (β). 

There are two forms of beta decay, β- and β+, which make the electron and the positron. β- is a single electron that has a negative charge of -1. Both beta decays also turn a neutron into a proton.

[[Scientific law]]

CATEGORIES: Science

A scientific law is an equation or statement that most scientists agree is true. A hypothesis becomes a law if the hypothesis is tested many, many times and is almost always true.

[[Gravitational singularity]]

CATEGORIES: Relativity, Black holes, Gravitation

A gravitational singularity (sometimes called a spacetime singularity) is a term used to describe the center of a black hole where gravity is thought to approach infinity.

In the center of each black hole is a singularity, a point where infinite density develops as spacetime approaches it. Spacetime goes toward infinite curvature and matter is crushed to infinite density under the pull of infinite gravity. At a singularity, space and time cease to exist as we know them and current laws of physics cannot be applied to this region.

Singularities form by a collapse of a star, where star with high enough mass (above 30 times the sun) would shrink under its own gravity and force until it becomes a single, one dimensional point. When it forms, space and time would be infinite in there. 

An example would be that if a person were to stand on a collapsing star right before the singularity forms, and they sent a signal every second to a nearby observer, time and space would slow down as the singularity is being formed. The observer would hear the signal slowing down. Let's say the singularity forms at 12:00 exactly. The observer would receive all the signals, one after another, with each new signal slowing down at a very small rate until the 12:00 signal. When the 12:00 signal was sent, time and space would be infinite -- in other words, it would take forever to get the signal.

To understand singularities, you have to think about infinite density, like how the original Big Bang started. The Big Bang, most scientists believe, started from an earlier universe that was pulled together by gravity into a single point. After that, it exploded and made all the matter in the expanding universe. A black hole singularity is similar, except on a smaller scale. Imagine if our sun decreased to the size of the nucleus of an atom. It would be very dense. However, our sun does not have a high enough mass to become a black hole. It is well below the Chandrasekhar limit, which means it will shrink to a white dwarf, with radius of a few thousand miles. It can't become a black hole, because it is too small.

(Paragraph 3-5 Based on "Brief History of Time" by Stephen Hawking)

[[Supermassive black hole]]

CATEGORIES: Black holes, Galaxies

A supermassive black hole (SMBH or less often SBH) is a black hole with a mass that is between 105 and 1010 the mass of the Sun. Scientists are confident that almost all galaxies, including the Milky Way, have supermassive black holes at their centers.

[[Event horizon]]

CATEGORIES: Black holes, Relativity

For the movie, see Event Horizon

In general relativity, an event horizon is the part of a black hole where light cannot escape. Imagine the black hole to be like a ball that you could see in a large spot of emptiness. The event horizon would then be an outer bubble that surrounds that ball, the space between the ball and the larger bubble would be the event horizon. If an object goes past the event horizon, it can never get away from it. Light that is emitted from inside of the event horizon near the black hole can never reach an observer on the other side. If an observer saw an object fall into a black hole, it would look like the object was stuck at the event horizon forever. The reason this happens is because of the gravity of the black hole slows down time around it, making it look like the object will take an infinite amount of time to reach it.

An attosecond (as) is a very short period of time. It is equal to one quintillionth of a second (or 0.000000000000000001 seconds). It can also be written as 10−18 seconds. Because it can be hard to think about how short this period of time is, on this page is a list of descriptions of periods of time longer than 1 attosecond, but shorter than one femtosecond (which is 10−15 seconds). This should help when thinking about periods of time that have different orders of magnitude.

[[Orders of magnitude (time)]]

CATEGORIES: Units of time

An order of magnitude describes the link between two amounts. The difference between each step is usually 10, with each order being either 10 times greater or 10 times smaller than the next amount. This makes the scale easy to manipulate using logarithms. For time, the difference between the smallest limit of time, the Planck time, and the next order of magnitude is larger than 10.

[[Chlorophytum comosum]]

CATEGORIES: Agavaceae

The Spider Plant, Chlorophytum comosum, is a species of Chlorophytum native to South Africa.

Spider plants have long narrow leaves that are 20–40 cm (8–15 in) long and 5–20 mm (0.2–0.8 in) broad. They  grow from a central rosette. It also produces branched stolons with small white flowers and baby plantlets.

It is a very popular houseplant. The most widely grown is the variegated cultivar 'Variegatum'. It has one or two broad yellowish-white bands running along the length of each leaf. Natural, entirely green plants are also grown. 

The Spider Plant is very easy to spread. They can be propagated by splitting its main rosette. It is even easier to remove plantlets from the stolons and plant them separately or put them in a glass of water. They will grow roots readily in water but establish faster in soil while still attached to the parent plant. Pinning the plantlet to the soil with a bent paper clip can be helpful. Make sure the soil is damp and well drained. The plantlet can then be removed from the parent plant in 7-10 days.

It is a very popular plant with beginners, as it is easy to grow and propagate.

Spider plants have also been shown to reduce indoor air pollution.

At the spot where a leaf would normally develop a node, these plants will produce adventitious roots down into the soil, and new above ground shoots.

[[Descendants of Charles II of England]]

CATEGORIES: House of Stuart, Jacobitism

The descendants of Charles II of England,  Stuart monarch of the Kingdom of England, Kingdom of Scotland and Kingdom of Ireland, are numerous; lines of his many illegitimate children exist to this day. Though Charles's wife Catherine of Braganza was barren, he stayed with her but had numerous mistresses. Some of Charles's illegitimate children were born before his marriage. This article deals with the most senior figures who were descended from Charles' illegitimate male children; the names of his daughters are also mentioned.

Although some of Charles' children made claims to the throne, most notably his first son James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth, their illegitimacy meant that after Charles' death, his brother James, Duke of York became king instead. Over the years several of Charles' senior descendants have made names for themselves, including Augustus FitzRoy, 3rd Duke of Grafton who became Prime Minister of Great Britain, cricket pioneer Charles Lennox, 1st Duke of Richmond, parliamentary reformer Charles Lennox, 3rd Duke of Richmond.

Diana, Princess of Wales was descended from two of Charles' illegitimate sons; Henry Fitzroy, 1st Duke of Grafton and Charles Lennox, 1st Duke of Richmond. This means should her son Prince William, Duke of Cambridge take to the British throne as he is expected to, William would become the first blood descendant of Charles II to do so. Though William is part of the royal House of Windsor, rather than the House of Stuart.

Now, there are a lot of people who live there. Most of the people work in Montreal so they have to use Highway 40, which cuts the town in half.

The town is on the north side of the St. Lawrence River

Although it is a very pleasant and calm town, there is nothing much to do. All year long, a bunch of festivals are organised, but they are mostly for children. The most popular festival is the Festival Feu Et Glace which happens during the winter.

Since the early 2000s, the only thing that changed in the town is that they built a lot of new houses.

[[Newspeak]]

CATEGORIES: Constructed languages

Newspeak is a concept from the book 1984 by George Orwell. It is based on English, which is referred to as Oldspeak in the novel, and it is the language that was created by Oceania and is the only language whose vocabulary grows smaller each year. For example, the word for "bad" becomes "ungood" in Newspeak, becoming a word simply meaning the opposite of "good", with the prefix "un-" meaning "not". In the novel, this language was designed by Party members as a means to limit human thought to absolute lowest level, that way they would be made to never be able to question whatever the Party tells the society.

[[Juncaceae]]

CATEGORIES: Poales

The Juncaceae, the rush family, is a family of rather small plants that often look like a type of grass. They often grow on wet, infertile soils. There are about 400 species organised into eight genera. Juncus is the most well-known and largest genus in the Juncaceae family.

They are part of the monocot flowering plant families, which means that their seeds only have one leaf to start off new growth. 

Rushes are found all around the world. They are commonly found in wet marshy areas, as the plant prefers moist soil. However, seedlings can survive dormant once well established even in the driest of places. Seeds spread by water or birds and other animals. They can live for up to 50 years lying dormant in droughts.

Rushes is a basic food of many animal diets. They are also used as bedding and nesting material for many different types of birds and mammals. Rushes have been used throughout history by humans for various purposes such as weaving matts, medicine and animal feed. Today they are still used in some places for making sleeping mats but are mostly used as a decorative plant around ponds.

[[The Prayer of Azariah and Song of the Three Holy Children]]

CATEGORIES: Old Testament books

The Prayer of Azariah and Song of the Three Holy Children are two sections that are in some Bibles inside chapter three of the Book of Daniel. These sections are sometimes called Additions to Daniel.

In chapter three of the Book of Daniel, King Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon builds a statue from gold, and he tells everyone to worship it. Some Jews living in Babylon named Azariah, Hananiah, and Mishael refuse to worship the statue. The king gets mad so he has them put into a big furnace to kill them. An angel protects them from the fire, and the king decides to let them go.

That story is in all Hebrew and Christian Bibles. Roman Catholics, Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox Bibles have a longer version of the story.

In the longer version of the story, Azariah's prayer is put after the three men are put into the furnace, starting at verse 24. In the prayer, Azariah says that he and the other people of Judah (part of ancient Israel) have sinned against God. He says that they are sorry and asks for God's protection.

The Song of the Three Holy Children is another part of the longer version of the Book of Daniel. It is sung by Azariah, Hananiah, and Daniel, who praise God and want everyone else to join them in prayer.

[[Ericales]]

CATEGORIES: Ericales

[[Godwin's law]]

CATEGORIES: Internet, Nazism

Godwin's Law (also known as Godwin's Rule of Nazi Analogies) is a saying made by Mike Godwin in 1990. The law states: "As a discussion on the Internet grows longer, the likelihood of a person/s being compared to Hitler or another Nazi, increases." That means that as more people talk on the Internet for a longer time, it becomes more and more likely that someone will talk about Hitler or the Nazis.

In 2019, Bret Stephens demonstrated  both the Streisand Effect and Godwin’s Law, by publishing a column in the New York Times, where he compared his experience on Twitter to the plight of Jews under Hitler’s regime.

[[De Wahl's rule]]

CATEGORIES: Linguistics, Constructed languages

De Wahl's rule is a rule of word formation, developed by the linguist Edgar de Wahl and applied in a constructed language Occidental (known also as "Interlingue") created by him. It is useful to create certain grammatical forms from others (for example substantives from verbs).

==Rule== 

Infinitives of verbs in the language Occidental have usually the ending -ar or -er. The root is obtained in the following manner: 

These six exceptions are: 

and the verbs formed from them with prefixes.

Because the rule composes from three parts, it is often known as "three de Wahl's rules".

One creates the substantives and adjectives by removing the endings and thus obtaining the root. After adding -r or -er, one obtains an infinitive in a majority of cases: decora/t/ion, decora/t-, decora/r.

[[Young's double-slit experiment]]

CATEGORIES: Quantum_mechanics, Experiments

The double-slit experiment in quantum mechanics is an experiment, which was first performed by physicist Thomas Young in 1801. It shows that light has both a wave nature or characteristic and a particle nature or characteristic, and that these natures are inseparable. So, light is said to have wave–particle duality rather than be only a wave or only a particle. The same is true for electrons and other quantum particles.

[[Convergent boundary]]

CATEGORIES: Plate tectonics

A convergent plate boundary is the boundary that occur when two plates collide each other either a continental plate with continental plate or oceanic plate. This causes very large earth movements. Plate collision can produce earthquake, volcanoes, mountains formation, and other geological event. The Himalayas were formed by such a collision.  Earthquakes and volcanoes are common near convergent boundaries. This is because of pressure, friction, and plate material melting in the mantle.

The diagram shows some differences between the two types of subduction.

The Battle of Gettysburg (locally ˈɡɛtɨsbɜrɡ, with an ss sound), was fought July 1–3, 1863. The battle took place in and around the town of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. It was the battle with the largest number of casualties in the American Civil War. Gettysburg is often called the war's turning point. Union Major General George G. Meade's Army of the Potomac stopped attacks by Confederate General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia. This ended Lee's second invasion of the North. Lee began to move his men back to Virginia on July 4. Between 46,000 and 51,000 soldiers from both armies were casualties in the three-day battle.

The Siege of Vicksburg ended on the same day, also a Union victory.

That November, a cemetery for those who died there was opened at the Gettysburg National Cemetery. President Abraham Lincoln gave a speech called the Gettysburg Address at the ceremony to open the cemetery and honor the dead soldiers on both sides.

[[Planetary nebula]]

CATEGORIES: Nebulae

A planetary nebula is a nebula that is made up of gas and plasma. They are made by certain types of stars later in their life. They look like planets through small optical telescopes. They do not last for long compared to a star, only tens of thousands of years.

At the end of a normal-sized star's life, in the red giant phase, the outside layers of a star are ejected. Because the outside is gone, the star shines brightly and is very hot. The ultraviolet radiation given off by the center of the star ionizes the gas and plasma that was thrown out from the star. This is what causes a planetary nebula to look like it does.

While some planetary nebulae look similar, others have very distinct and unique shapes. Scientists are not sure why planetary nebulae can look so different from one another. Scientists think that binary stars, stellar winds and magnetic fields might be some of the reasons planetary nebulae can look so varied. In the early 21st century some astronomers began calling them “globular nebulas” to avoid confusing them with the Protoplanetary nebulas that make planets.

[[Emission nebula]]

CATEGORIES: Nebulae

An emission nebula is a cloud of plasma emitting light in many colors. The glowing is caused by a star being near the nebula. There are many types of emission nebula. H II regions are caused when stars are forming and are very hot, causing the plasma to heat up. Planetary nebulae are made when where a dying star has thrown off its outer layers. This causes the core of the star to heat up the plasma.

[[Reflection nebula]]

CATEGORIES: Nebulae

In astronomy, a reflection nebula is a cloud of dust which reflects the light of a star or many stars. The light from the nearby stars is not hot enough to ionize the gas of the nebula to make an emission nebula. However, is enough to make the dust visible because the light reflects off of the dust. 

Reflection nebulae are usually blue because the scattering works better for blue light than red (this is the same reason that the sky is blue and sunsets are red).

Reflection nebulae and emission nebulae are usually seen together and sometimes are called 'diffuse nebulae'. A good example of this is the Orion nebula.

Reflection nebulae may also be the site of star formation.

[[Variable nebula]]

CATEGORIES: Nebulae

A Variable nebula is a reflection nebula that gets brighter and darker because of changes in its star.

[[Ionization]]

CATEGORIES: Physics

Ionization is the physical process of giving or taking away electrons from an atom. That makes the atom into an ion, because ions have electrical charge. 

In the process of ionization, an electrically neutral atom becomes either positively or negatively charged. Some substances are easier to ionize than others. This depends on the ionization energy. Ionizing radiation is a common cause, but ionization can also be done artificially.

[[Nucleosynthesis]]

CATEGORIES: Astrophysics

Nucleosynthesis is the physical process where lighter elements are changed into heavier elements. This usually happens in the center of a star, both during its life and especially during its violent death. It is also thought that this happened at the beginning of the universe, in the big bang.

[[Stellar wind]]

CATEGORIES: Astrophysics

Stellar wind is gas being thrown off from the upper atmosphere of a star.  Different types of stars have different types of stellar winds.  The Sun's stellar wind is called solar wind.  Most stars, especially very bright ones, show continuous outflows of gas from their surfaces making the stellar wind.  Radiation pressure is thought to be the main force that pushes the gas away, but modern research uses computer simulations and observations with the most powerful telescopes to understand it further.

[[Dumbbell nebula]]

CATEGORIES: Nebulae

The Dumbbell nebula (sometimes called Messier 27, M 27, or NGC 6853) is a planetary nebula in the constellation Vulpecula. It is about 1,360 light years away from earth. The Dumbbell nebula was the first planetary nebula to be discovered; by Charles Messier in 1764.

[[Astronomical spectroscopy]]

CATEGORIES: Astrophysics, Spectroscopy

Astronomical spectroscopy is the science of using spectroscopy to figure out what elements astronomical bodies, such as stars, planets and nebulae, are made of. It can also be used to work out how those objects are moving, using doppler shift.

The study of spectroscopy and spectra is used in astronomy to help scientists study the whole spectrum of electromagnetic radiation, including visible light, which radiates from stars and other hot celestial objects. Spectroscopy can be used to find properties of distant stars and galaxies. It can find out their chemical composition, temperature, density, mass, distance, luminosity, and relative motion using doppler effect measurements.

[[Emission spectrum]]

CATEGORIES: Physics

The emission spectrum of an element or compound is how bright certain frequencies are when energy is added to the atoms or molecules.

Each atom's emission spectrum has different spectral lines and can be used to figure out if that atom is part of a compound

[[Luminosity]]

CATEGORIES: Laws of physics

Luminosity is the amount of power given off by an astronomical object.

There are other ways to describe luminosity. The most common is apparent magnitude, which is how bright an object looks to an observer on Earth. It only applies to light, that is, visible wavelengths. Apparent magnitude is contrasted with absolute magnitude, which is an object's intrinsic brightness at visible wavelengths, irrespective of distance.  The apparent magnitude is the less, for objects more than 32.6 light years away.

When talking about the total power output across all wavelengths, that is called bolometric magnitude.  

[[Solar mass]]

Solar mass is a unit of measurement of mass. It is equal to the mass of the Sun, about 332,950 times the mass of the Earth, or 1,048 times the mass of Jupiter. Masses of other stars and groups of stars are listed in terms of solar masses. Its mathematical symbol and value are:

[[Interstellar medium]]

CATEGORIES: Astronomy

In astronomy, the interstellar medium (sometimes called the ISM) is the tenuous gas and dust that fills the void between stellar systems in galaxies, that consisting mainly of huge clouds of ionized, netral, or moleculer hydrogen. This gas and dust not distributed uniformly in interstellar space, but displays significant variations in density, temperature, and ionization state.

Various gases exist in outer space. Most common are hydrogen and helium. Interstellar cosmic dust makes nebulae.

[[Myopia]]

CATEGORIES: Diseases and disorders of the eye

Myopia, also called near-sightedness or short-sightedness, is a problem with the focusing ability of the eye. It is when the eye is not able to focus properly on objects in the distance. This condition is very common and it often occurs with many members of the same family. It happens when the lens becomes a different shape (too curved) from usual, or when the eye is longer than normal, so light entering the eye focuses on a point in front of the retina, rather than right on it. This makes distant objects look blurry. People with myopia often squint while watching television or trying to see distant objects. Sudden myopia can often be the first symptom of Type II Diabetes. 

In most cases, it can be fixed easily using glasses, contact lenses, or surgery. 

[[Luster (mineralogy)]]

CATEGORIES: Minerals

Luster (or lustre) is a description of the way light interacts with the surface of a crystal, rock, or mineral. For example, a diamond has an adamantine lustre and pyrite has a metallic lustre. The term is also used to describe other items with some kind of sheen (for example, fabric, especially silk and satin, or metals).

The word lustre comes from the Latin word lux, meaning "light", and generally implies radiance, gloss, or brilliance.

[[File:Feynmann Diagram Gluon Radiation.svg|thumb|287px|In this Feynman diagram, an electron and positron destroy each other, producing a

virtual photon which becomes a quark-antiquark pair. Then one radiates a gluon]]

A Feynman diagram is a diagram that shows what happens when elementary particles collide.

Feynman diagrams are used in quantum mechanics. A Feynman diagram has lines in different shapes—straight, dotted, and squiggly—which meet up at points called vertices. The vertices are where the lines begin and end. The points in Feynman diagrams where the lines meet represent two or more particles that happen to be at the same point in space at the same time. The lines in a Feynman diagram represent the probability amplitude for a particle to go from one place to another.

In Feynman diagrams, the particles are allowed to go both forward and backward in time. When a particle is going backward in time, it is called an antiparticle. The meeting points for the lines can also be interpreted forward or backwards in time, so that if a particle disappears into a meeting point, that means that the particle was either created or destroyed, depending on the direction in time that the particle came in from.

All the lines and vertices have an amplitude. When you multiply the probability amplitude for the lines, the amplitude for the particles to go from wherever they start to wherever they meet, and to the next meeting point, and so on, and also multiply by the amplitude for each meeting point, you get a number that tells you the total amplitude for the particles to do what the diagram says they do. If you add up all these probability amplitudes over all the possible meeting points, and over all the starting and ending points with an appropriate weight, you get the total probability amplitude for a collision in a particle accelerator, which tells you the total probability of these particles to bounce off one another in any particular direction.

Feynman diagrams are named after Richard Feynman, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics. His diagrams are very simple in the case of quantum electrodynamics (QED), where there are only two kinds of particles: electrons (little particles inside atoms) and photons (particles of light). In QED, the only thing that can happen is that an electron (or its antiparticle) can emit (or absorb) a photon, so there is only one building block for any collision. The probability amplitude for the emission is very simple—it has no real part, and the imaginary part is the charge of the electron.

Raymond VII of Saint-Gilles (July 1197 – 27 September 1249) was Count of Toulouse, Duke of Narbonne and Marquis of Provence from 1222 until his death.

He was the son of Raymond VI of Toulouse and Joan of England. During the Albigensian Crusade in May of 1216, he set out from Marseille and besieged Beaucaire, which he captured on August 24. He fought to get the county of Toulouse back from Simon de Montfort, 5th Earl of Leicester and later Simon's son Amaury VI of Montfort.

When Raymond died, Alphonse became count of Toulouse, and after Alphonse's death the county was captured by France. Raymond VII was buried beside his mother Joan in Fontevrault Abbey.

[[Rival]]

CATEGORIES: Human behavior

A rival is a  person or group of people who are trying to do the same thing as someone else, and trying to do it better.  They are "competing" against one another.  Usually they are about equally good.

Competing in this way is called rivalry.

Two (or more) businesses may be rivals.  For example: they may be selling ice creams in the same area.

Brothers and sisters may be rivals.  For example: they may both be trying to get their mother's attention.

Countries may be rivals.  For example: they may be trying to have power over the same thing.  This can be a dangerous thing which, in some cases, can lead to war.

In sport, two teams may be rivals.  This is a more friendly kind of rivalry.

[[Hubble Deep Field]]

CATEGORIES: Cosmology, Galaxies, Space

The Hubble Deep Field, sometimes called the HDF, is an image of a small part of the night sky. The image was taken in the direction of the constellation Ursa Major by the Hubble Space Telescope in 1995.

It is important because it shows some of the earliest (farthest away) galaxies ever seen, over 3000 in total.

The area of the sky the HDF was taken in makes up less than 1/10th the width of a full Moon, yet it contains over 3,000 galaxies.

Because of the time it takes for light from these galaxies to reach Earth, many in the picture look exactly as they did over 10 billion (10,000,000,000) years ago. Because of this it allows scientists to look at what the Universe was like at that time, and how it changed to become what it is now. Add to this the cosmological principle, which suggests that on large scales the Universe is roughly the same no matter what direction you look, and the HDF becomes a very important tool for astronomers studying how the Universe has changed.

For these reasons the HDF is sometimes called 'the most important image ever taken'.

[[Interlingue]]

CATEGORIES: Constructed languages, Interlingue

Interlingue is a constructed language. It was called Occidental between 1922 and 1947. Edgar de Wahl, one of the first Esperantists, created it. De Wahl was from the city of Tallinn in Estonia, which was in the Russian Empire but later became its own country. He spoke German, Russian, Estonian and French since he was a child and had natural ability in languages. He is often called de Wahl.

Interlingue looks a lot like languages in the Romance language family: French, Spanish, Italian, and so on. De Wahl made a rule called De Wahl's rule that made changing verbs to nouns easier and more regular. For example, the change of d in the word exploder (to explode) to s (making explosion and explosiv) is a regular change when following this rule.

De Wahl was not happy with Esperanto. He decided to create a language called "Occidental". He published it in 1922. In 1949 the users of Occidental voted to change the name to Interlingue.

There were already many types of constructed languages during de Wahl's time. Some of them, like Esperanto and Ido, are called schematic because they follow their own design even if the words look more artificial. Others, like Latino sine flexione and Idiom Neutral, are called naturalistic because they try to look like natural languages. The difficulty was that creators had to choose between being regular or looking natural. Louis Couturat, the creator of Ido, wrote the same thing in 1903, and called it a paradox: "The international words are not regular, and the regular words are not international." The language that de Wahl made had a goal to be a language that was both regular and natural at the same time.

[[Commitment scheme]]

CATEGORIES: Cryptography

In cryptography, a commitment scheme is a way for a someone to tell something to someone without letting other people know. Someone would do this to make sure they can prove who they are. Someone also might do this to make sure that someone does not cheat.

This is done by using a one-way function to change a string into a hash. This is called the commit phase. Later, if someone needs to prove that they were the one who made the commitment, then they can tell people the original string they used. This is called the reveal phase.

[[One-way function]]

CATEGORIES: Cryptography

In cryptography, a one-way function is a function that is very simple to compute (figure out) in one direction. There is a series of instructions that can be simply and easily applied to an input to give a complicated output. However the reverse of going from the output to the input is made to be as difficult as possible.

[[SHA hash functions]]

CATEGORIES: Cryptography

In cryptography, the Secure Hashing Algorithms are a group of cryptographic hash functions released by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The algorithms take an input and produce a hash value (often shown in hexadecimal). The length of the hash depends on the digest length of the algorithm.

[[Border Gateway Protocol]]

[[Stockman]]

CATEGORIES: Australian culture, Agriculture in Australia, Agricultural occupations

In Australia, a stockman is the name given to a person who looks after the livestock on large farms known as a station. Stations are owned by a grazier or a grazing company. A stockman can also be the persons employed at abattoirs, feedlots, on live export ships or with stock and station agencies.

People who work on station, including stockmen, are also known as “station hands”. Men learning how to become station managers are known as "jackaroos", while women are known as "jillaroos". Girls are often stockmen on farms. Some stations are now making it easier for women to work on stations by building female living quarters and putting in machinery to do some of the heavy work.

A related job is that of the drover, who, like the shearer may be an temporary seasonal worker. Drovers are employed in looking after the livestock while they are travelling on a stock route. 

The word stockman was used in the United States and Canada as meaning a person who raised livestock, mainly cattle. The word stockgrower is used now. This meaning is very different from the Australian use of the word stockman.

[[Riemann zeta function]]

[[File:Complex zeta.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Riemann zeta function ζ(s) in the complex plane. The color of a point s shows the value of ζ(s): strong colors are for values close to zero and hue encodes the value's argument.

The white spot at s= 1 is the pole of the zeta function; the black spots on the negative real axis and on the critical line Re(s) = 1/2 are its zeros.]]

In mathematics, the Riemann zeta function is an important function in number theory. It is related to the distribution of prime numbers. It also has uses in other areas such as physics, probability theory, and applied statistics. It is named after the German mathematician Bernhard Riemann, who wrote about it in the memoir "On the Number of Primes Less Than a Given Quantity", published in 1859. 

The Riemann hypothesis is a conjecture about the distribution of the zeros of the Riemann zeta function. Many mathematicians consider the Riemann hypothesis to be the most important unsolved problem in pure mathematics.

[[Probable prime]]

CATEGORIES: Number theory

In mathematics, particularly number theory, a probable prime is a whole number that is likely to be prime by having passed a probabilistic test such as Fermat's primality test.  Probable primes may be composite, but the tests are designed so they are really unlikely to be composite.  These probabilistic tests are easier to do than tests that actually guarantee primality, and the composite probable primes are useful too in encryption that uses prime numbers.

[[Orbitron]]

CATEGORIES: 1960s automobiles

The Orbitron is a custom car built by Ed Roth.  It was lost for many years until it was found again in Mexico in 2007. 

Built in 1964, the car ran with a 1955 or 1956 Chevrolet V8 and a Powerglide automatic transmission.  The body was made by hand out of fiberglass.  The driver sat in a cockpit set all the way to the back of the car.  This was where racing drivers sat when they drove a drag racing car.  It was lined with a funny-looking material called "fake fur" and it even had an 11" General Electric portable television in the console.  On top of the cockpit was a top made of heavy, clear plastic.  A top like this is called a "bubble top" since it looks like half of a soap bubble sitting on top of the driver.   It raised up by itself with the push of a doorbell button on top of the hood.  The hood raised by itself as well when a different button was pushed.

Roth built the frame himself out of box-shaped steel tubing.  The engine came from one of his 1955 Chevrolets.  He removed it so that he could put in a newer, larger V8 engine given to him by General Motors.  The Orbitron was one of the very few cars which MRoth thought was a "mistake" after he built it.  He was very proud of the shiny chrome work he did to the engines and frames of his cars; the Orbitron's engine and frame were covered by the body.  The Orbitron was one of his few custom cars to even have a hood.  It was said that the automatic hood did not fit well.

The Orbitron's most fun feature was its front end.  It had three red, green and blue tinted headlamps.  It was thought that combining the lights would make a white light; the idea came from color television.

Another car builder, Darryl Starbird, bought the Orbitron from Mr. Roth in 1967 for US$750.00. Mr. Starbird traded it to a man in Texas, but Mr. Starbird does not remember the man's name.  From Texas the Orbitron was traded to a carnival owner in Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua, Mexico in 1991.  By that time the special nose had been cut off and thrown away, possibly to help keep the engine cool as it was driven around the carnivals.

Michael Lightbourn, a man who restores old cars, heard that the Orbitron was in Ciudad Juárez.  He discovered it parked in front of an adult bookstore where it was in very poor shape and was being used as a trash can. 

The car, which used to be painted blue, had been spray painted in black and was almost complete except for the hood, the television, the fur lining, the cut-off nose and the bubble top.  The top had to be destroyed in the early 1970s when it became stuck and trapped someone inside. 

The family who owned the bookstore had also owned the carnival in which the car was used.  After Mr. Lightbourn made a deal with the family, he was able to bring the Orbitron to the United States.  It was then sold to Beau Boeckmann, the host of the TV show "Pimp My Ride."  He fully restored the Orbitron in 100 days.  He made it exactly like it was when it was new.  All the original parts which could not be used and which Mr. Boeckmann removed from the car, including the frame which was too rusted to reuse, were stored away.  Mr. Roth died in 2001, but Mr. Boeckmann was able to get help from men who helped design and build the car in 1964, including designer Ed "Newt" Newton and painter Larry Watson.  The inside was redone by Joe Perez who did the original job.

The restoration even includes the same type of television.  A small tape recorder and tape were found hidden in the cockpit.  This was played when the car was new.  It told people who were looking at the car what made it special and it still works today.  Planet Plastics of Chino, California, the original company which made the bubble top, was asked to create a replacement.  Little bits of the car's original "candy blue" color (similar to a very fancy color called "candy apple red") were found inside the car.  They were used to match the color of the new paint.  The original Chevrolet engine with its very special carburetors and Chevrolet Corvette aluminum valve covers has been rebuilt and put back in the Orbitron.

It is on the cover of the March 2009 edition of Hot Rod Deluxe, a "retro" version of Hot Rod Magazine.

[[Parallax]]

CATEGORIES: Astronomical distances, Vision

Parallax is the perceived change in position of an object seen from two different places.  

In astronomy, annual parallax is the only direct way to measure distance to stars outside the solar system.

In essence, parallax is the perceived shifting phenomenon which occurs when an object is viewed from different positions.

It is measured by the angle between two lines of observation. Nearby objects have a larger parallax than more distant objects when observed from identical positions, so parallax can be used to determine distances.

Astronomers use the principle of parallax to measure distances to celestial objects including to the Moon, the Sun, and to stars beyond the Solar System. Here, the term "parallax" is the angle between two sight-lines to the star.

Astronomical measurement of position are taken at different times of the year. Since the Earth's orbit is known exactly, the distance from position 1 to position 2 can be worked out. The angle from the horizon to the object can be measured precisely. This gives a triangle whose baseline and angles are known accurately. From the triangle, the distance is calculated by trigonometry and expressed in parsecs.

The method only fails with objects which are so distant that the earth's orbit is too small to get a large enough parallax angle to measure accurately. This distance is about 100 light-years. Astronomers have invented various ways to solve this problem, though none are so accurate as the parallax method is for relatively nearby objects. This provides a basis for the cosmic distance ladder of techniques to calculate greater distances.

From 1989 to 1993 the Hipparcos satellite took measurements for over 100,000 nearby stars. Gaia (spacecraft) is intended to make similar measurements of about a Billion stars.  

Many animals, including humans, have two eyes which provide  depth perception; this is called stereopsis. Because the two eyes are at different places on the head, this gives the basis for an automatic sense of distance. We perceive this as a normal 3-D scene.

[[Dyson sphere]]

CATEGORIES: Space colonization, Science fiction, Thought

A Dyson sphere is an idea about a structure that surrounds a star, first thought up by physicist Freeman Dyson, and then used in some science fiction works. 

The idea of the Dyson sphere was the result of a thought experiment. Dyson noted that civilizations constantly increased their need for energy. He reasoned that as human civilization went on, there would come a time when it demanded more energy than the Earth could provide.

He proposed a system of structures designed to intercept and collect all energy produced by the Sun. Dyson's proposal did not detail how such a system would be constructed. His 1960 paper "Search for artificial stellar sources of infra-red radiation",  in the journal Science, was the first to present the concept of the Dyson sphere.

There are at least three types of Dyson spheres:

[[Glow fuel]]

CATEGORIES: Hobbies

Glow fuel is a term used to tell about fuel used for model airplanes, helicopters, cars and boats.  Glow fuel can be burned by very simple two-stroke engines or by four-stroke engines.  Engines like this provide lots of power in a small size.

Sometimes, glow fuel is called nitro or just model fuel.  Some model fuel has only a little bit of nitro, but some fuel has none at all.  It is called "FAI fuel."  "FAI" stands for Fédération Aéronautique Internationale.  They say that models used in racing or other competition under their rules may not have any nitro in their mix.

Glow fuel is mostly made of methanol, nitromethane and oil.

Methanol is the main ingredient.  It provides most of the fuel's ability to burn.  In order to burn the glow fuel, a glow engine must have a glow plug.  The glow plug burns very hot as the engine runs because of a catalytic reaction with the methanol.  Since the engines turn very fast, a phenomenon known as thermal inertia helps to keep the plug glowing as the engine runs.  A small amount of electricity is used to cause the glow plug to glow as the engine is started.  Once the engine is running, the electricity is disconnected. 

Nitromethane is added to the fuel for more power and to make the engine easier to tune.  Nitromethane contains less energy than the same amount of methanol, but it requires less oxygen.  This means that more of it can be put into an engine during each turn of the engine.  This leads to more power.

Fuel for most model planes, boats and helicopters has 5% to 15% nitromethane.  For use in race cars, the nitromethane can be from 30% to as much as 65%.

Nitromethane is hard to get in some countries since it is known as an explosive.  In these countries, glow fuel sometimes has no nitromethane at all.  

Since the engine doesn't have its own supply of oil, it's instead added to the fuel to help lubricate the moving parts and to keep them from burning up.  The oil can be castor oil or synthetic oils.  Some fuels include a mixture of the two.  The oils included in glow fuel are not burned by the engine.  Instead, the oil comes out of  the exhaust.  Not only does the oil lubricate the moving parts, but the oil which comes out the engine helps carry away extra heat.

Glow engines should be run slightly "rich."  This means that the mix of fuel and air going into the engine has to have a bit more fuel in it than it can burn at once.  This unburned fuel and oil help keep the engine cool.  After a model has been run, it is coated with a film of oil and must be cleaned.  Ordinary window cleaner and a paper towel do a nice job of removing the oil. 

Glow fuel is not difficult to make, but some of the ingredients are dangerous in large amounts.  Instead, most modelers buy their glow fuel already made.  Some very small engines require more oil than larger engines.  More oil may be needed in the fuel.  The proper oil can be found at a hobby shop.  Companies which make glow fuel mix their fuels with the help of computers.  This helps each batch of fuel be of the highest quality it can be.

[[Genotype]]

CATEGORIES: Classical genetics

The genotype is the genetic constitution of an organism, mainly its genome. The term is contrasted with the term phenotype, as follows:

The terms were invented by Wilhelm Johanssen to distinguish between inherited and environmentally produced variation. "The distinction was not new. It had, for instance, been discussed by Francis Galton as nature vs. nurture.

The extent to which the genotype influences the phenotype varies hugely. Some aspects of the phenotype are almost entirely determined by heredity, such as eye colour and blood types. Human language is an interesting case. The capacity to learn and speak a language is entirely inherited, but which language is spoken is entirely learnt, and hence is environmental.

[[Antikythera mechanism]]

CATEGORIES: Ancient history, Technology

The Antikythera mechanism is a  mechanical calculator. It was an Ancient Greek  analogue computer and orrery. It was discovered in 1902 in a shipwreck off the coast of Antikythera, Greece.

A number of gears worked together, much like they do in a mechanical clock. The device could predict astronomical positions, eclipses, the motions of the sun, the moon and probably some of the planets. This makes it possible to use the device as a calendar. There were three big dials, and three small ones. Used as a calendar the main functions were:

The device was found on a shipwreck, near the island of Antikythera, between the Peloponnese and Crete. Different coins were also found on the wreck. There are coins from Pergamon, dating between 86 BC and 67 BC, and coins from Ephesus, dating between 70 BC and 60 BC. This means that the ship sunk between 70 and 60 BC. This device is the most complex device known in Antiquity. Only in the 14th century did people again have the knowledge to build similar devices.

The device  is now on display in the Bronze Collection of the National Archaeological Museum of Athens.

When the mechanism was found, it consisted of corroded metal plates. Before x-rays could be used to show what was "inside", it was very difficult to judge what the mechanism did. Many of the parts that make up the mechanism were lost either during the roughly 2000 years it had laid on the sea floor, or shortly after discovery. Many gears have not "survived" in one piece. None of the scales is complete, and only one indicator survived as a fragment. The Antikythera Research project has produced a reconstruction; it added seven gears that were probably part of the device. There are 35 gears, and seven displays. There are many hints that the device was also used to calculate and show the movement of stars, even though none of the necessary gears or displays have been found.

[[Bubblegum]]

CATEGORIES: Candy

Bubble gum is a popular type of candy that is not eaten, but instead chewed. Before being chewed bubble gum is hard. When it is chewed it is soft. It is called bubble gum, because once soft a person could create a bubble with the gum by blowing air into it. Bubble gum comes in many flavors.

Bubble gum was invented in 1928 by Mr. Walter Diemer when he was doing something else. He only had pink food coloring. That is why most bubble gum is pink. His gum was called Dubble Bubble, which was the first bubble gum ever made. Bazooka was the second made bubble gum.  Thomas Adams made a kind of bubble gum called Black Jack.

[[Hay]]

CATEGORIES: Poales, Agriculture

Hay is grass and other plants that have been cut, dried and collected. It can then be stored in piles (called hay stacks), or tied into blocks called bales. Bales can be round or box shaped (usually called square bales).

Hay is mostly used to feed animals. Some animals that eat hay are horses, cattle, goats, donkeys, and rabbits. Hay is fed when there is not enough pasture or rangeland on which an animal can graze or they can't graze year round. Farmers and ranchers often need to use hay in the winter when grass is not available.

Hay is different than straw.  Hay is made from leafy grass and other plants (such as alfalfa) and is good for feeding animals.  Straw comes from the stems of cereal grains, and is not very nutritious.  Straw is normally used for bedding to keep animals warm and dry.

[[Rangeland]]

CATEGORIES: Agriculture

A rangeland is like a pasture. A rangeland can be used for animals to graze on or for whatever the rancher wants.

He was given the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1945.

Pauli was of Jewish descent.

[[Hanukkah]]

CATEGORIES: Hanukkah

Hanukkah is a Jewish holiday which celebrates the victory of the Maccabees over the larger Syrian army. It also celebrates a miracle that happened during this time, where just a day's supply of oil allowed the menorah (Hanukkiah or Hanukkah Menorah) in the rededicated Temple in Jerusalem to remain lit for eight days. Therefore, Jewish people celebrate Hanukkah for eight days. Hanukkah begins on the 25th day of Kislev according to the Hebrew calendar, which on the Gregorian calendar is late November or December. For example, in 2013 it started on November 27. The Hebrew word hanukkah means rededication.

The hanukiah (or hanukkah menorah) is a candle holder, an important Hanukkah symbol. It has nine branches.   Traditionally, one candle is separated from the rest, usually by being higher than the other eight. On the first night, only one candle is lit, on the right side of the hanukiah. On the second night, a second candle is added, and they are lit from left to right -- but the Hanukkiah is filled from right to left. This continues for all eight nights. The candles are never lit directly - instead, the higher candle, (called a shamash, meaning "attendant") is lit first, and then used to light the rest of the candles. While the candles are lit, blessings are said over them.

Jewish children often play a game called dreidel. The dreidel is a four-sided spinning top, each side having a Hebrew letter. The four letters (nun, gimel, hey, and shin) stand for the Hebrew phrase, "Nes gadol haya shaam," meaning, "A great miracle happened there." In Israel, by contrast, the dreidel reads "Po" instead of "shaam," meaning "here." So in Israel the phrase is, "a great miracle happened here."

[[Madrid Symphony Orchestra]]

CATEGORIES: Orchestras, Madrid, 1903 establishments in Europe, 1900s establishments in Spain

The Madrid Symphony Orchestra (Orquesta Sinfónica de Madrid) is an orchestra based in Madrid, the capital of Spain.  It was started in 1903.  

The orchestra gave its first public concert under the conductor, Alonso Cordelás on 7 February 1904 at the Teatro Real.  The next year Enrique Fernández Arbós became conductor of the orchestra, and he stayed with them for more than 30 years.  The orchestra played a lot of Spanish music as well as music by composers from other European countries.  Some very famous people such as Igor Stravinsky and Richard Strauss conducted the orchestra.  The orchestra gave the first performances of famous pieces such as: Falla's Nights in the Gardens of Spain (1916) and  Prokofiev's Second Violin Concerto (1935). 

During the Spanish Civil War it was difficult to keep the concerts going.  After the war, in June 1939, Arbós died and many of the musicians had gone into exile because of the rise of the dictator General Francisco Franco.  The conductor Enrique Jordá kept the orchestra going until 1945 when the World War II ended.

From 1958 the orchestra often played for comic Spanish operas called zarzuelas.  They often travelled through Spain and to  Portugal and Latin America giving concerts..

In 1965 a new orchestra, the Orquesta Sinfónica de RTVE, was started.  This made things difficult for the Madrid Symphony Orchestra.  They had to spend a lot of time playing for the Teatro de la Zarzuela. In the 1970s they made a lot of recordings of zarzuelas and Spanish operas.  The recordings were very good, but they did not have much time for orchestral concerts.

After Franco’s death the orchestra became the official orchestra for the Teatro de la Zarzuela.  Later, when a new concert hall, the Auditorio Nacional de Música was opened, the orchestra had more opportunity to give orchestra concerts.  In 1997, the Orchestra moved out of the Teatro de la Zarzuela and moved to the Teatro Real where they will stay at least until 2009.  The orchestra now have an educational plan to help young children listen to music and encourage them to play instruments.

Today the orchestra is conducted by  Jesús López Cobos.

[[Nuclear explosion]]

CATEGORIES: Nuclear weapons, Nuclear energy

A nuclear explosion is energy being released from a very fast nuclear reaction. It can be caused by nuclear fission, nuclear fusion, or both.

Atmospheric nuclear explosions are associated with mushroom clouds, although mushroom clouds can occur as a result of large chemical explosions. It is also possible to have an air-burst nuclear explosion without these clouds. Nuclear explosions produce radiation and radioactive debris.

The nuclear weapon was first detonated in combat on 6 August 1945, when the United States dropped a uranium gun-type device on the Japanese city of Hiroshima. The second and last use of a nuclear weapon in combat occurred three days later when United States dropped a plutonium implosion-type device on the Japanese city of Nagasaki. These bombings resulted in the immediate deaths of around 120,000 people while more died over time due the nuclear radiation. 

Power plant accidents such as those at Chernobyl and Fukushima were caused by steam and hydrogen explosions, not nuclear explosions. The fuel in a nuclear power plant is not enriched enough to create a nuclear explosion.

One-third of all human deaths are from poverty-related causes: 18 million annually, including 12 million children under five.

At the other end of the spectrum, the 15 percent of people in the developed countries have 80 percent of global income. Pogge says that shifting 1 or 2 percent of our share toward poverty eradication seems morally compelling. Yet most of the rich people believe that they have no such responsibility.

[[Orto botanico di Pisa]]

CATEGORIES: Buildings and structures in Italy, Botanical gardens in Europe, Pisa

The Orto botanico di Pisa, also known as the Orto Botanico dell'Università di Pisa, is a botanical garden, and the University of Pisa takes care of it. The garden is at via Luca Ghini 5, Pisa, Italy. It is open weekday mornings and it does not cost money to see it.

The garden was started in 1544 under Cosimo I de' Medici as the first university botanical garden in Europe, and it was put under the care of the famous botanist Luca Ghini of Imola. In 1563 the garden was moved from its original place near a river (now the Medicean Arsenal) to one near the convent of Santa Marta. In 1591 the garden was again moved to a third place, where it still is. From these early times, the garden has contained a gallery of natural objects (now Pisa's Museo di Storia Naturale), a library (now part of the university library), and portraits of its directors throughout the centuries. It also includes one of the earliest iron-framed hothouses built in Italy.

Today there are different sections in the garden containing the botanical school, gardens, ponds, greenhouses, and various buildings. Major collections include herb gardens and arboreta, as well as the old botany institute, built 1591–1595, with a facade ornamented with sea-shells.

[[Seismology]]

CATEGORIES: Geology

Seismology is the study of what is under the surface of the Earth by measuring vibrations on the Earth's surface. A person who does this is called a seismologist. 

It is part of the science of geophysics, which studies the physics of the processes that formed the Earth and other planets. 

Seismology is done by seismologists and geophysicists using devices to pick up the vibrations called geophones, hydrophones or seismometers.

Seismology can either be passive, just listening to vibrations caused by earthquakes and volcanic activity, or active, using small explosive charges to send vibrations into the ground.

Seismic detectors come in two types, one which measures up and down vibrations, and one which measures side to side vibrations. Both types use and arrangement of a magnet and a coil of wire which will convert the vibrations into an electrical signal which can be stored in a computer for analysis. The earliest seismometer was developed by the Chinese.  

Seismologists can find the location of earthquakes by plotting received vibrations on a map. They can also pick up underground nuclear tests, and this is what many of the seismic recording stations were set up for.

They can also examine the crust in a seismic survey to try and find information about layers of rock, locate oil or gas fields and to get information about the internal structure of volcanos.   

[[Godparent]]

CATEGORIES: Christian worship and liturgy, Judaism

A godparent is an adult who sponsors a child during a formal religious ceremony or rite. Many religions have godparents or other adults who do something almost the same.

The role of a god parent is to also give the god child a gift, small or big, money, toys, etc. Mainly on Sundays. 

Originally a godparent was someone who agreed to help raise the child and help them to become a good member of the religion. They may also have taken over as parent to the child if both its real parents died. Today, the role of godparent is not often a formal one, and has no real responsibility to the child. A female child of a godparent is a goddaughter. A male child of a godparent is a godson.

[[Susanna (Book of Daniel)]]

CATEGORIES: Old Testament books

The story of Susanna and the Elders is found in some Bibles inside chapter three of the Book of Daniel. These sections are sometimes called Additions to Daniel. Modern Jewish and Protestant Bibles do not have this story but Catholic and Orthodox ones have it. This story is found before Daniel 1:1 as a prologue in very old Greek texts. It is found as chapter 13 in the Vulgate and modern Catholic Bibles.

In the story, two bad judges secretly want to have sexual intercourse with Susanna, a beautiful and virtuous wife. One hot day, she takes a bath inside her walled garden but she does not know that the judges are hiding inside the garden. The judges tell her to have sex with them but she doesn't want to. When she refuses, they tell the people of the village that they saw her having sex with a man who was not her husband. This is called adultery, which was against the law at that time. The people of the village believe the judges and want to kill Susanna. A boy named Daniel does not believe the judges, so he asks one of the judges to go away and the other one to say what he saw. Daniel does this again with the other judge. The judges tell different stories, showing that they lied. The people get mad and kill the judges instead.

[[California Proposition 8]]

CATEGORIES: United States law, 2000s in California, Same-sex marriage, 2008 in the United States

Proposition 8 is an initiative passed in California on November 4, 2008 that banned same-sex marriage.  The measure passed by 52% to 48%. It changed California's Constitution by adding a section that says, "Only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California."  The law was in response to a judge's ruling that gay marriage was legal under the California state Constitution.  The campaign to pass Proposition 8 was mostly paid for by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.

Proposition 8 is controversial and is being debated in court. On August 4, 2010, Judge Vaughn Walker in the United States District Court made a ruling that Proposition 8 was unconstitutional and should be overturned. This would make same-sex marriage legal again in California, however, Judge Walker issued a stay of execution, so that those in favor of Proposition 8 could legal appeal.

The appeal of the case went to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. On February 7, 2012, the judges in this court agreed with Judge Walker that Proposition 8 was unconstitutional. However they also issued a stay of execution, so that their ruling could be appealed to the United States Supreme Court.

Those in favor of Proposition 8 appealed to the Supreme Court on July 30, 2012. On December 7, 2012, the Supreme Court agreed to judge the case. The Supreme Court will issue a final ruling on the case in 2013.

There are several possible outcomes:

Depending on exactly how the Supreme Court rules, Proposition 8 could be overturned in California only, or all other laws against same-sex marriage in the United States could be overturned as well.

[[Czechoslovak government-in-exile]]

CATEGORIES: Czechoslovakia

The Czechoslovak government-in-exile (sometimes called officially as: provisional government of Czechoslovakia) was an informal name given to the Czechoslovak National Liberation Committee, first by British diplomatic recognition. The name was used by other World War II Allies as they followed the British in recognizing it. The Committee was originally created by the former Czechoslovak President, Edvard Beneš in Paris, France in October 1939. Unsuccessful negotiations with France for diplomatic status, as well as the impending Nazi occupation of France, forced the Committee to move to London in 1940. From there, it moved to Aston Abbots, Buckinghamshire in 1941, where it sought relative safety from the London Blitz.

It was the true government for Czechoslovakia throughout the Second World War. A specifically anti-Fascist government, it sought to reverse the Munich Agreement and the following German occupation of Czechoslovakia, and to return the Republic to its 1937 boundaries. Due to this it was considered, by those countries that recognized it, the legal continuation of the First Republic of Czechoslovakia.

[[Train]]

CATEGORIES: Trains

A train is a set of carriages on a railway. A place where a train stops to let people get on and off is called a Train station or railway station. Early trains used horse power and ran on wooden or iron tracks. These were used in the Middle Ages. The first steam trains were built in England in the early 19th century. Long before railways, "train" meant any group of vehicles or pack animals traveling in a line, as in wagon train or camel train.  

Trains contain the prime mover (either locomotive or motor unit) and one or more cars. The locomotive or railway engine (usually the first car of the train) pulls the cars along the track.

[[Durand Line]]

CATEGORIES: History of Afghanistan, History of Pakistan, 1893 establishments, 1949 disestablishments in Asia

The Durand Line is the international 2430 land border between Afghanistan and Pakistan in South-Central Asia. It was established after an 1897 memorandum of understanding (MoU) between Mortimer Durand of British India and Afghan Amir Abdur Rahman Khan.  Referred to as a frontier line, it is named after Mortimer Durand, who was the Foreign Secretary of colonial British India at the time. Later, Abdur Rahman Khan's successor, Amir Habibullah Khan signed a new agreement with Britain which again confirmed the legality of the Durand Line. King Amanullah Khan also accepted Durand line as international border between Afghanistan and British India after signing the Anglo-Afghan treaty of 1919. Article 5 of this treaty, on the basis of which Afghanistan reclaimed its independence, says that Afghanistan accepted all previously agreed border arrangements with British India.  Hence, Afghanistan as an independent country recognized Durand line as an international border.

The Durand Line cuts through the Afghan tribal areas, politically dividing ethnic Pashtuns and Baloch people who live on both sides.  The line is internationally recognized by many countries as the western border of Pakistan, but Afghan governments after 1947 never recognized it.

Afghan Pashtun leaders claim Pakistani territories and say that the Durand Line is "an issue of historical importance for Afghanistan. The Afghan people, not the government, can take a final decision on it." However, non-Pashtuns Afghans have always recognized durand line as international border between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Similarly, Pakistani Pashtuns have also recognized Durand line as international border between Afghanistan and Pakistan. In 2017 President Hamid Karzai said Afghanistan "will never accept" the Durand Line.

[[Henri Poincaré]]

CATEGORIES: 1791 births, 1867 deaths, French mathematicians, French physicists, Theoretical physicists

Jules Henri Poincaré (29 April 1854 – 17 July 1912) was a French mathematician and scientist. He was described as a "monster of mathematics " when still a child. Many people think he was the last person to understand all branches of mathematics before the subject became too big for anyone to do this. 

He came from a clever family, his father was a professor of medicine and his cousin, Raymond Poincaré became president of France. He was sick as a child and for many years he had to be taught at home by his mother.

He used his mathematical skills to look at some of the biggest problems in science in his day. He was the first person to describe in mathematical terms how three planets in orbit affect each others paths as they pass near by one another. This was called the Three Body Problem. He also tried to understand why the speed of light seems to be the fastest speed at which anything can travel in the universe. In some ways he beat the famous scientist Albert Einstein to solving this question, but Einstein gave a more complete answer. He gained fame for the discovery of the theory of relativity instead of Poincaré.

He created the Poincaré Conjecture, one of the most famous problems in mathematics which was only solved 100 years later. He began the branches of mathematics which are known today as chaos theory and topology.

He also wrote about science in a simple way that ordinary people could understand.

[[Skydiving]]

CATEGORIES: Sports

Skydiving is parachuting from an airplane for fun. Skydiving can be done individually and with groups of people.  Training is required.  Unlike most paratroopers, skydivers often wait until they are low, before opening the parachute.  The jump can also be made from a helicopter or a balloon that is high enough in the sky.  Skydiving can be an exciting sport.

Skydiving includes free falling (usually from an aeroplane) through the air prior to opening a parachute.   Typically skydives are carried out from around 4,000m (or 12,500ft) offering 40 to 50 seconds of freefall time.  Longer free fall times can be achieved by exiting an aircraft at altitudes much higher than 4,000m, but very high jumps require pressurized oxygen within the aircraft, and bottled oxygen for the diver. 

During a skydive, total freedom and control of the air can be enjoyed as well as many complex and spectacular manoeuvres including flat turns, somersaults and formation skydiving. Skydiving can be enjoyed either as an individual - doing solo(alone) jumps - or as part of a team carrying out formation skydiving. Generally, the term ‘skydive’ refers to the time spent in freefall from exiting an aircraft to deploying a parachute but skydiving does include some disciplines such as accuracy landings and canopy formation flying which concentrate on the time spent once a canopy has been deployed.

[[Toxic assets]]

CATEGORIES: Economics

The term toxic asset is a nontechnical term used to describe certain financial assets when their value has fallen significantly and when there is no longer a functioning market for these assets, so that they cannot reasonably be sold. This term became common during the financial crisis that began in August 2007. Toxic assets played a major role in that crisis. When the market for such assets ceases to function, it is described as "frozen". 

Markets for some toxic assets froze in 2007, and the problem grew significantly worse in the second half of 2008. Several factors contributed to the freezing of toxic-asset markets. The value of the assets were very sensitive to economic conditions, and increased uncertainty in these conditions made it difficult to estimate the value of the assets. Banks and other, major financial-institutions were unwilling to sell the assets at significantly reduced prices, since lower prices would force them to significantly reduce their stated assets, making them appear insolvent.

[[Tesseract]]

Biltong can be made of a variety of meats, though beef biltong is the most common one in modern times. Strip-cut beef fillets that are flat with muscle grains are used to make biltong. Due to this, biltong is usually slightly chewy. Biltong has traditionally been made of game meats such as kudu, springbok and wildebeest. You may also find biltong made of chicken, fish and ostrich meat.

Jerry Fodor (April 22, 1935 – November 29, 2017) was a philosopher. He mostly worked on the philosophy of mind and cognitive science, both of which are concerned with how the mind worked.

His studies have concerned themselves with the idea of whether thought is expressed in language or whether it is absurd to think so. Fodor also attempted to tie in the design of the brain to the thoughts held within. This is described by many as a return to the 19th century practice of phrenology, although Fodor offers more science to back his version up than phrenologists. It is these views which led other philosophers, such as Jared Cole and Daniel Dennett to describe Fodor's claims as absurd and out of date.

Fodor lived in Newark, New Jersey with his wife, Janet. He had two children and several cats. Outside philosophy he enjoyed opera and writes for the London Review of Books.

Fodor died in New York City of complications from Parkinson's disease on November 29, 2017 at the age of 82.

[[Hysterectomy]]

CATEGORIES: Female reproductive system

A hysterectomy is surgery to remove the womb. This is usually done by a gynecologist. 

Women who undergo a hysterectomy can no longer bear children. Hysterectomies are done for certain forms of cancer of the reproductive system (affecting womb, cervix, ovaries), or tumors.

A woman may have her uterus removed because she has a tumor. A tumor can be cancer. Another type of tumor can be benign. The uterus may be removed because organs in the pelvic area have moved down. When organs move, the uterus may move down, too. A hysterectomy may be able to fix this problem. A hysterectomy can be done for other reasons. These are endometriosis, bleeding, and pain that does not stop.

When a woman has a hysterectomy other organs may be removed. Removing the ovaries and fallopian tubes can be part of the hysterectomy.

Louis David Riel  (22 October 1844 – 16 November 1885, ˈluːi riːˈɛl (Loo-E Ree-L) in English) was a Canadian politician. He founded the province of Manitoba and was a leader of the Métis people of the Canadian prairies. He led two resistance movements against the Canadian government and its first Prime Minister, Sir John A. MacDonald. 

Riel tried to preserve Métis rights and culture. He is regarded by many as a Canadian folk hero today. June 2020

Until recently, Riel was regarded as an outlaw. During a battle against the Canadian government his people took prisoners. 

One of these prisoners was a man named Thomas Scott. Scott would often be resistant and disrespectful of his captors. When Scott assaulted one of Riel's men, Riel had had enough. 

He was put on trial to a jury containing several of Riel's most trusted men (including Elzéar Goulet, a Métis leader who supported Riel.) The court found Scott annoying, and he was sentenced to death for being mean, by a firing squad. 

The English speaking people of Ontario considered this murder and a war party called the Wolsely Expedition was sent to put his rebellion down. This, eventually led to his capture. Riel was hung in Regina due to his involvement in the resistance against the Canadian government.

[[Final Solution]]

CATEGORIES: Nazi Germany, Nazism, The Holocaust, Genocide, War crimes

The Final Solution (German: Die Endlösung) was a plan made by the Nazi Germany to kill millions of Jews and Gypsies (Roma and Sinti people of Romania and many other European countries) during World War II. On July 31 1941, Nazi leader Hermann Goering ordered the SS to make plans for a  "complete solution of the Jewish question." At first people were simply shot dead, but in the autumn of 1941 the SS and police began using mobile killing vans. People were locked into the back of trucks which had been changed to allow the exhaust gases such as carbon monoxide to enter. The people sealed in the back of the truck were gassed which lead to them unfortunately dying a horrible death.

Heinrich Himmler brought in a plan known as Operation Reinhard, named after SS General Reinhard Heydrich, who had been killed by Czech soldiers. Three camps were set up in Poland for the purpose of killing people. These were at Belzec, Sobibor and Treblinka. In 1942 more death camps were set up in Poland at Majdanek, Chelmno, and Auschwitz. By the end of World War II about six million people had been killed.

[[Last Supper]]

CATEGORIES: Jesus Christ

The Last Supper is the final meal that, in the Gospel accounts, Jesus shared with his apostles in Jerusalem before his crucifixion. Gospel Jesus The Apostle Paul tells of this supper in his first letter to the Corinthians.  The Synoptic Gospels all tell of Jesus using the bread and wine as symbols of his body and blood.  the Gospel of John does not include those details but tells of Jesus washing the feet of the disciples.  This has led to some Christian groups having a ritual of foot washing as a sign of humility. 

The Last Supper is commemorated by Christians especially on Maundy Thursday. The Last Supper provides the purpose for Eucharist, also known as "Holy Communion" or "The Lord's Supper".

[[Suetonius]]

CATEGORIES: Ancient Roman historians, Biographers

Suetonius was a Roman historian. His most important work is called De Vita Caesarum, or Lives of the Caesars. It includes the biographies of twelve successive Roman rulers, from Julius Caesar to Domitian.

Suetonius was born when Vespasian was emperor, so scholars say he must have been born before 79 c.e.  His father was from Rome's equestrian social class.  He worked as a secretary for Emperor Hadrian but he was accused of something having to do with the empress Sabina and was forced to retire in 121 c.e.  He wrote De Vita Caesarum after that.

Westerners during the medieval and early modern periods thought De Vita Caesarum was a very good book.  Many scholars have read and translated it.  It has been printed in more than 100 separate versions since 1500 a.d.

[[ISO 8601]]

CATEGORIES: ISO standards

ISO 8601 is an international standard to describe dates and times in the easiest way possible for computers to understand.

This standard is based on putting the biggest types of numbers first and the smallest numbers last. Because years are bigger than months, and months are bigger than days, they are put in the order of YEAR-MONTH-DAY.

A basic ISO date for today looks like CURRENTYEAR-CURRENTMONTH-CURRENTDAY2.

The basic ISO time is CURRENTHOUR:CURRENTMINUTE.

Another very important principle is that when a computer or human puts ISO 8601 dates into alphabetical order, they are also in chronological order.

People can also use these dates, but it is currently not common for people in any country to write dates using this standard in their day-to-day lives.

[[Golden eagle]]

CATEGORIES: Accipitriformes

The golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) is one of the best-known birds of prey in the northern hemisphere. It is the most widely distributed species of eagle. Golden eagles use their agility and speed combined with powerful feet and massive, sharp talons to snatch up prey. They eat hares, rabbits, marmots and other ground squirrels.

Once common across the Holarctic, it has gone from many areas heavily populated by humans. The species is still widespread. It lives in Eurasia, North America, and parts of North Africa.

Like all eagles, it belongs to the family Accipitridae. It is one of the largest birds of prey in North America; only the  California condor gets larger. Golden eagles also live in the Scottish Highlands.

[[Manager (baseball)]]

CATEGORIES: Baseball, Baseball coaches

A manager is the head coach of a baseball team.  His job is to tell the players on the team what to do and make decisions about how the team should play, like who will play in what position.  

In the past, managers were usually players. Since they were players, these managers wore the same uniform as the rest of the team. Managers who were not players, such as Connie Mack, would not be dressed in uniform. Today, managers dress in the same uniform as the team, even though most managers today are not players. Managers in Major League Baseball and for many other teams as well are usually former players themselves. Their playing experience may give them more knowledge on the game that they can use to help their team. 

[[Convex regular 4-polytope]]

CATEGORIES: Shapes

In mathematics, a convex regular 4-polytope (or polychoron) is 4-dimensional (4D) polytope which is both regular and convex. These are the four-dimensional analogs of the Platonic solids (in three dimensions) and the regular polygons (in two dimensions).

These polytopes were first described by the Swiss mathematician Ludwig Schläfli in the mid-19th century. Schläfli discovered that there are precisely six such figures. Five of these may be thought of as higher dimensional analogs of the Platonic solids. There is one additional figure (the 24-cell) which has no three-dimensional equivalent.

Each convex regular 4-polytope is bounded by a set of 3-dimensional cells which are all Platonic solids of the same type and size. These are fitted together along their respective faces in a regular fashion.

[[Polychoron]]

CATEGORIES: Shapes

In geometry, a polychoron (plural: polychora) is a figure in four dimensions. The word comes from Greek poly, which means many and choros which means room, or space. Sometimes the figure is called 4-polytope or polyhedroid. The analogue figure in two dimensions is a polygon, and the one in three dimensions is a polyhedron.

This agreement meant that the Army of Bengal surrendered to the British army and were killed at the Battle of Plassey. This was the start of the British rule in Bengal.

He is remembered by the people of Bengal and Pakistan. The word "mirjafar" in Bengali and the phrase "meer jafar" in Urdu now are often used to mean traitor.

[[Convex set]]

CATEGORIES: Geometry

In Euclidean space, a region is a convex set if the following is true. For any two points inside the region, a straight line segment can be drawn. If every point on that segment is inside the region, then the region is convex.

The point is that a convex curve forms the boundary of a convex set. So, any shape which is concave, or has a hollow, cannot be a convex set.

[[Mutualism]]

CATEGORIES: Coevolution, Symbiosis

Mutualism is a relationship between two organisms in which both benefit. It is a type of symbiosis which improves the biological fitness of both parties. The two organisms usually come from widely different types, often from different phyla or even kingdoms. The term is not used for any cooperation between animals of the same species.

Edouard van Beneden (18091894) introduced the term into evolutionary biology and ecology in the 1870s.

[[16-cell]]

CATEGORIES: Geometry

In four dimensional geometry, a 16-cell, is a regular convex polychoron, or polytope existing in four dimensions. It is also known as the hexadecachoron. It is one of the six regular convex polychora first described by the Swiss mathematician Ludwig Schläfli in the mid-19th century. 

Conway calls it an orthoplex for orthant complex, as well as the entire class of cross-polytopes.

[[Regular polytope]]

CATEGORIES: Shapes

In mathematics, a regular polytope is the generalisation of the regular polygon. Like other polytopes it may have any natural number of dimensions. For example, a two-dimensional regular polytope is a regular polygon, and a three-dimensional regular polytope is a regular polyhedron. Like with the regular polygon, there are certain kinds of symmetries. Regular polytopes have regular facets (faces to speak from the 3D viewpoint), and their vertex figures are regular.

The simplest of the six convex regular 4-polytopes are the pentachoron and tesseract.

[[Canadian English]]

CATEGORIES: Canada, Languages of North America

Canadian English is the type of English that is used by Canadians.

It is like American English in terms of vocabulary, but its grammar is like that of British English.

Canadian English is generally taught in schools using British ways of spelling, such as colour, flavour, and so on. However, the word themselves are usually American, in part because Canadians watch a lot of American TV shows and listen to a lot of American pop music. Rarely, the British form of words may be replaced with American forms, such as plow, program, and so on.

The main exception to this rule is terms related to cars and the auto industry. Because Canada's auto industry has always been dominated by American firms, Canadians use American words and spelling for such terms. Canadians and Americans spell the outer rubber portion of a wheel as tire instead of tyre, put gasoline or gas in their vehicles instead of petrol, store items in the trunk instead of the boot, and may drive a truck instead of a lorry.

Canadian English is different from other forms of English in its spoken form also. The dialects vary from sounding overtly English to an indistinguishable form very similar to those spoken in the northern states.

[[Cone cell]]

CATEGORIES: Eye anatomy

Cone cells or simply cones are special photoreceptor cells in the retina. They react to light and work best in relatively bright light. 

Cone cells are less sensitive to light than rod cells. Rod cells are more sensitive, but cannot tell colors apart. Human eyes usually have three different types of cone cells. That allows the brain to tell colors apart. Their reaction to stimuli is faster than that of the rod cells. For this reason, they can perceive finer details, and more rapid changes in images.  

The three kinds of human cones have different photopsins. Each photopsin has a different response curve to light, and so responds to color in different ways. This gives trichromatic vision. Being color blind means a lack of one or two types of cone cells.

In a publication done in 1935, Osterberg thinks that there are about 6 million cone cells in a human eye.

[[Joni Mitchell]]

CATEGORIES: Joni Mitchell, 1943 births, Living people, Canadian guitarists, Canadian singer-songwriters, Musicians from Alberta

Roberta Joan Anderson (born November 7, 1943 in Fort Macleod, Alberta, Canada), better known as Joni Mitchell, is a Canadian songwriter, musician and artist. Her usual musical instrument is a guitar. Her songs include "Big Yellow Taxi", "Woodstock" (about the 1969 Woodstock Festival), "Free Man In Paris", "Help Me" and "Both Sides Now". Her name Mitchell comes from her first marriage (to Chuck Mitchell).

She first began singing folk music while she attended art school, to earn spending money. In time, her songs and style got her noticed, and she became a professional musician. She signed a recording contract, and her first album appeared in 1968. "Both Sides Now" also boosted the musical career of Judy Collins, another folksinger, whose cover version became a popular hit. She also performs in the contralto range.

Mitchell had romantic relationships with Stephen Stills and David Crosby, both of the band Crosby, Stills & Nash. She also did artwork for one of their album covers. She was scheduled to appear at the Woodstock Festival, as CSN was (joined by Neil Young), but she had to cancel. Her song "Woodstock" still became a hit for CSN, and summed up for many people the meaning of the festival.

During the 1970s, Mitchell changed from folk music to jazz, and she lost some of her fans. Many other people enjoyed her later music, though, including an album she made with Charles Mingus, a legendary jazz musician. The album was Mingus's last project before his death.

Not all of Mitchell's records have been hits, and she resisted compiling a "best-ofs" or "greatest hits" album for many years, feeling that if she did so, her career would be "over". She did finally release a pair of recordings, Hits (which contained her biggest hit records) and Misses (which included some of her favorite songs, that were not hits). She continues to perform, and to paint pictures. Her paintings are displayed in galleries around the world.

Before she became famous, Mitchell gave up a newborn daughter for adoption in Canada. During the 1990s, the two got back in contact, and now have a good relationship.

Though she first became famous during the 1960s, Mitchell does not romanticize that era. She reminds listeners of the negative parts of it, and encourages them to make the present better.

In March 2015, Mitchell was found unconscious in her Los Angeles home. She regained consciousness in an ambulance on her way to hospital, but was taken to intensive care for tests.She had a brain aneurysm. She was diagnosed with a throat tumor later the next day.

[[Town square]]

CATEGORIES: Town squares

A town square is a large open area in the center of a town. Town squares were traditionally places where people came together to meet, or to sell and buy things, or to be entertained. They often had markets, lynchings, or they were used for concerts. They are often surrounded by shops or cafés.

Other names for town square are civic center, city square, urban square, market square, public square, Platz (from German), plaza (from Spanish), piazza (from Italian), and place (from French). 

Many town squares in the 20th century became used as car parks. In recent years cars have been banned from some town squares so that people can enjoy the open space once more, free from traffic and pollution.

In other parts of towns there are often smaller open spaces which are called “squares”. They are often square in shape, but some are different shapes.

Some famous squares include: Red Square in Moscow, Beijing's Tiananmen Square in Beijing, Times Square in New York City and Trafalgar Square in London.

[[Legal tender]]

CATEGORIES: Currency

Legal tender is fiat money, or currency (bank notes and coins). It has value because a government creates it and backs it, and people using it have faith in its value. Fiat money such as US dollars can be used as an exchange for goods and services.

The point is that other kinds of money have been used. Legal tender differs from commodity money and representative money. Commodity money is based on a "good", often a precious metal such as gold or silver, which is desired or has other uses. Representative money is a claim on the commodity rather than the actual good. In that case, the gold stays in a bank, and its ownership changes from time to time as the money is used. Why might a good be used at all? One reason is that governments cannot just make it. It is said that this stops inflation because, with fiat money, governments can just print more.

Some economists argue that an economy can only grow if it can produce more capital goods and not more money in the form of credit. This means that good economies must produce things rather than borrow money to buy things produced in other countries.

Alan Greenspan was an early critic of fiat money arguing that "Deficit spending is simply a scheme for the confiscation of wealth". He thought the value of money should be backed by gold. Richard Nixon ended gold backing for the United States dollar in 1971. Other countries also changed to Fiat currency.

The San Joaquin River is one of the two major rivers of California, in the United States. At 330 long, it is the second longest river in California, after the Sacramento River. It begins on the west Sierra Nevada Mountains and flows west and north to its end at San Francisco Bay, at the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. 

Its basin, which is about 32,000 square miles (82,879 square kilometers) in size, contains mostly farmland. The river provides drinking water to over 22 million California citizens. Its three largest tributaries are the Merced, Tuolumne, and Stanislaus rivers.

The river was once one of the richest river ecosystems in California. However, now over 60 of the river is dry except during floods, because lots of water has been taken away for irrigation. In fact, below Friant Dam, a dam built in the 1940s on the San Joaquin River, 95 percent of the river's flow is dry. Much of the river is polluted, destroying the historic population of chinook salmon, once the southernmost in the United States. Pesticides, selenium, and many more toxic materials are carried by the San Joaquin into San Francisco Bay.

Now, one of the largest projects in the American West has been begun to restore the San Joaquin River. On September 13, 2006, the Natural Resources Defense Council signed an agreement with Friant Dam users and the United States Department of the Interior. This agreement would restore the San Joaquin River below the dam, reducing pollution.

[[Hudson Valley]]

CATEGORIES: Geography of New York, Valleys of the United States

The Hudson Valley is a valley of the Hudson River. It runs from about Westchester County to Albany.

The Hudson River valley runs in a north-south direction across eastern New York State.  There are many rock types in the valley.  This includes Triassic sandstones and redbeds in the south, and the Palisades Sill.  Older Precambrian gneiss is in the north (and east).  

In the Hudson Highlands, the river enters a fjord. This fjord was cut during previous ice ages. To the west are the very long Appalachian highlands. Near Tappan Zee Bridge, the west side of the river has high cliffs. They are about 400–800 feet high.

Most of the Hudson Valley is part of the Appalachian Mountains. The northern part of the Hudson Valley is part of the Great Lakes area.

During the last ice age, the valley was filled by a large glacier. The glacier went down as far as Long Island. Near the end of the last ice age, the Great Lakes drained south down the Hudson River. The drained water is called Lake Iroquois. Lake Ontario is the remnant of that lake.

[[Sargassum]]

[[Central Valley]]

CATEGORIES: Central Valley of California

A map of California's Central Valley.

The Central Valley (also called the Great Central Valley) is a very large valley in the middle of California, in the United States. About 42,000 square miles (108,779 square kilometers) in size, it is about the size of the state of Tennessee. It consists of two connected, differently named valleys, the Sacramento Valley and the San Joaquin Valley.

The Sierra Nevada Mountains border the valley on the east side, while the Coast Range borders it on the west side. The Sacramento River flows through the north part of the Central Valley. This part of the valley is also called the Sacramento Valley. The San Joaquin River flows through the larger south part of the Central Valley. also called the San Joaquin Valley. Both rivers merge eventually and empty into the Pacific Ocean via San Francisco Bay. 

The capital of California, Sacramento, is located in the north part of the Central Valley. In total, the Central Valley is around 450 long.

The Central Valley has 18 California counties. 15 of these counties are among the 25 most productive farmland in California. Overall, the Central Valley economy depends on farming. However, this has led to serious environmental damages, such as pesticides and selenium and other bad materials being washed into the rivers and polluting the San Francisco Bay.

[[Tributary state]]

CATEGORIES: States, Politics

A tributary state is a state that  is subordinate to a more powerful neighbour. It was a form of subordination in pre-modern times.

The tributary sent a regular token of submission to the superior power. This was a tribute, a substantial gift of wealth, such as the gold, produce, or slaves. The tribute might best be seen as the payment of protection money. But there were other ways to show submission as well.

For modern forms of state subordination, see puppet state, satellite state and client state.

[[Taifa]]

CATEGORIES: History of Islam, History of Portugal, History of Spain

A taifa (from طائفة ṭā'ifa, plural طوائف ṭawā'if) was an independent Muslim-ruled principality. Taifas developed during the history of Iberia. They were usually emirates or little kingdoms, but there was one oligarchy as well, Seville. A number were formed in the Al-Andalus (Moorish Iberia) after the end of the Umayyad Caliphate of Cordóba in 1031.

They developed because of an administrative division of the Umayyad Caliphate of Córdoba and an ethnic division of its elite. It was divided among Arabs (a powerful but tiny minority), Berbers, Eastern European former slaves and Iberian Muslims (known as Muladíes (the great majority). 

There was a second period when taifas developed: the middle of the 12th century, when the Almoravid dynasty was in decline.

In the 11th century and again in the mid 12th century, the emirs (rulers) of the taifas kept fighting among themselves, not only militarily but also for cultural prestige. They tried to recruit the most famous poets and artisans.

After the end of the Caliphate, the rival Muslim kingdoms were much weaker than the Christian ones and so they had to submit and to pay tribute. 

The taifa princes appealed for North African warriors to help them fighting Christian kings on two occasions. The Almoravids were invited after the fall of Toledo (1085), the Almohads after the fall of Lisbon (1147). The warriors did not help the taifa emirs but rather annexed their lands to their own North African empires.

Taifas often hired Christian mercenaries to fight neighbouring realms (both Christian and Muslim). The most dynamic taifa, which conquered most of its neighbours before the Almoravid invasion, was Seville. Zaragoza was also very powerful and expansive, but was kept in check by the neighbour Christian states of the Pyrenees. Zaragoza, Toledo and Badajoz had previously been the border military districts of the Caliphate.

[[Nasrid]]

The Nasrid dynasty or Banuu Nasri (بنو نصر) was the last Arab and Muslim dynasty in Spain. The Nasrid dynasty came to power after the defeat of the Almohad dynasty in 1212 at the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa. Twenty-three different emirs ruled Granada from the founding of the dynasty in 1232 by Muhammed I ibn Nasr until January 2, 1492, when Muhammad XII of Granada surrendered to the Christian Spanish kingdoms of Aragon and Castile. Today, the most visible evidence of the Nasrids is the Alhambra palace built under their rule.

[[Sleep apnea]]

CATEGORIES: Sleep, Health problems

Sleep apnea (or Sleep apnoea) is a problem certain people have: When they sleep, they may stop breathing for short periods. These periods can last for 10 seconds or more. 3-4 breaths are missed. As a result of this, those affected are often tired during the day. Mainly because such people also tend to have microsleep, they should not drive vehicles. Sleep apnea is a treatable disease.

[[Microsleep]]

CATEGORIES: Sleep

Microsleep is a very short sleep that occurs when people are awake. It can last from under a second to about 30 seconds. It may happen as a result of sleep deprivation, fatigue, sleep apnea, narcolepsy, or hypersomnia.  Microsleeps can occur at any time. Most of the time, they do so without warning. When people have a microsleep during conversation, they may lose track of the subject that was talked about. 

Microsleep can be extremely dangerous in situations when people drive a car, work on a machine or otherwise need to stay alert.  People with  microsleeps usually are not aware of them. They instead believe that they were awake all the time.  One example is called "gap driving":  a person is driving a car and suddenly realizes that several seconds have passed by unnoticed.  The driver does not feel that she or he has been asleep during those missing seconds, although this is in fact what happened.  The sleeping driver is at very high risk for having an accident during microsleep.  

Many accidents and catastrophes have resulted from microsleep episodes in these circumstances.  For example, a microsleep episode is claimed to have been one factor contributing to the Waterfall train disaster in 2003; the driver had a heart attack and the guard who should have reacted to the train's increasing speed is said by his defender to have microslept.
