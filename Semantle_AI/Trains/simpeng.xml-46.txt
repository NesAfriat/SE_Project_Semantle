[[Outstation]]

CATEGORIES: Indigenous Australian culture, Agriculture in Australia, Buildings and structures

In Australia, an outstation is a small, rural settlement of Aboriginal Australians. They are usually built on or near the community's traditional country; the outstations are therefore also called homelands. The people living on an outstation are usually closely related, belonging to one or two families. The people will have a spiritual and ancestral relationship with the land. The number of people living in the settlement may rise and fall throughout the year, depending on events (such as deaths and ceremonies), but the permanent population is normally less than a few dozen. The definition of an outstation will vary greatly depending on the region, cultural group, history and state property laws. They are generally classed as residential areas on Aboriginal-owned land. They are often located near sites that are culturally important. The average outstation consists of little more than one or more houses and a source of water. They are usually very basic, and constructed entirely by the people living there. Most of these communities are located in the Northern Territory, Western Australia, South Australia and Queensland.

In statistical data, outstations are called "discrete indigenous communities". There are more than a thousand such communities in Australia. They are largely self-governing.

[[Thalassaemia]]

CATEGORIES: Genetic disorders, Blood

Thalassaemia (or thalassemia) is a genetic disorder of the blood which originated in the Mediterranean region. 

This disease is caused by the weakening and destruction of red blood cells. This is caused by mutant genes which affect how the body makes haemoglobin. Haemoglobin is the protein in red blood cells which carries oxygen. People with thalassaemia make less haemoglobin and fewer circulating red blood cells than normal, which results in mild or severe anemia.

Thalassaemia can cause significant complications, including pneumonia, iron overload, bone deformities and cardiovascular illness. However, this inherited disease of red blood cells gives a degree of protection against malaria, which is or was common in the regions where the trait is common.  This selective survival advantage for carriers (known as heterozygous advantage) is responsible for keeping the mutation in populations way above its mutation rate. Carriers are heterozygous for the thalassaemia allele, meaning only one of their two alleles is mutant (abnormal). There are a number of different versions of thalassaemia.

[[Cepheid variable]]

CATEGORIES: Variable stars

Cepheids are a type of very luminous variable stars. There is a strong direct relationship between a Cepheid's luminosity and pulsation period. This makes Cepheids important standard candles for the galactic and extragalactic distance scales.

Cepheid variables are divided into several subclasses which exhibit clearly different masses, ages, and evolutionary histories: 

The first cepheid known was Delta Cephei in the constellation Cepheus, found by John Goodricke in 1784. Delta Cephei is of great importance because its distance is extremely well known, thanks in part to it being in a star cluster, and the precise Hubble Space Telescope/Hipparcos parallaxes.

[[RR Lyrae]]

CATEGORIES: Variable stars

RR Lyrae is a pulsating variable star in the constellation Lyra. It is the model for the variable stars known as RR Lyrae variables. It pulses over a short cycle of 13 hours, 36 minutes. Each radial pulsation causes the radius of the star to vary between 5.1 and 5.6 times the Sun's radius.

Stars of this type are often found in globular clusters, and used as standard candles to measure distances to other galaxies.

RR Lyrae and its type are pulsating stars of spectral class A (and rarely F), with a mass of around half the Sun's. It is thought they previously shed mass and consequently, they were once stars with similar or slightly less mass than the Sun, about 0.8 solar masses.

RR Lyrae stars pulse in a manner similar to Cepheid variables, so the mechanism for the pulsation is thought to be similar. The nature and histories of these stars is thought to be rather different.

Unlike Cepheids, RR Lyraes are old, low mass, metal-poor "Population II" stars.  They are much more common than Cepheids, but also much less luminous. The average absolute magnitude of an RR Lyrae is about 0.75, only 40 or 50 times brighter than our Sun. Their period is shorter, typically less than one day, sometimes ranging down to seven hours.

The relationship between pulsation period and absolute magnitude of RR Lyraes makes them good standard candles for relatively near objects, especially within the Milky Way. They are extensively used in globular cluster studies, and also used to study chemical properties of older stars.

Knowing the period-luminosity relation for local RR Lyrae-type variable stars allows the distance of more distant stars of this type to be determined. The distance of RR Lyrae remained uncertain until 2002 when the Hubble Space Telescope was used to fix its distance within a 5% margin of error. The result was 854. When combined with measurements from the Hipparcos satellite and other sources, the result is a distance estimate of 860.

[[Enterococcus]]

CATEGORIES: Gram-positive bacteria

Enterococcus is a genus of lactic acid bacteria of the phylum Firmicutes.

Enterococci are Gram-positive cocci that often occur in pairs or short chains. They look like streptococci. Two species are regular gut flora organisms in the intestines of humans: E. faecalis (90-95%) and E. faecium (5-10%).

[[Mycoplasma]]

CATEGORIES: Gram-negative bacteria

Mycoplasma is a genus of bacteria. They do not have a cell wall around their cell membrane. 

They are gram-negative, and need sterols such as cholesterol for growth. Many common antibiotics such as penicillin that target cell walls do not affect mycoplasma. Mycoplasma are the smallest bacterial cells yet discovered. They are typically about 0.1  µm in diameter.

Many species are parasitic, pathogenic or saprophytic, and can survive without oxygen. In humans, M. genitalium causes urethritis, and M. pneumoniae is a common cause of pneumonia. Some live as saprophytes but the majority are parasites of plants and animals. The parasitic nature is due to the inability of mycoplasmal bacteria to synthesise the required growth factor. 

[[Micropaleontology]]

CATEGORIES: Fossils, Paleontology

Micropaleontology (also sometimes spelled as micropalaeontology) is the branch of paleontology that studies microfossils. Microfossils are fossils generally not larger than four millimeters, and commonly smaller than one millimeter. A microscope is used to study them. Every kingdom of organisms is represented in the microfossil record. Microfossils can provide important information about the ecology in the past.

People who study micropaleontology are called micropaleontologists. Taxonomy and statistics are important parts of micropaleontology. 

Microfossils are most common in sediment that forms beneath water, particularly ocean water or lake water. Very old microfossils may be found in rock. Special techniques are used to separate microfossils from rock. For example, the shells of diatoms and some other organisms are made of silica; other materials in the rock can sometimes be removed with acid, leaving just the silica shells.

Micropaleontology can be divided into four areas of study. The different areas of study  use different techniques to separate the microfossils. This is because the microfossils are made of different minerals: 

The area of study for pollen and spores, including fossils, is called palynology.

[[Palynology]]

CATEGORIES: Paleontology, Botany, Fungi, Forensics

Palynology is the study of very small natural particles. The word literally means the "study of dust". A palynologist is someone whose job is to identify what the particles are. Samples of particles can come from the air or water or soil or rocks. They could be organic and inorganic. Micropaleontology is a related area of study; it involves very small fossils.

[[Delta Cephei]]

CATEGORIES: Variable stars

Delta Cephei (δ Cep, δ Cephei) is a binary star system about 887 light-years away in the northern constellation of Cepheus, the King. At this distance, the apparent magnitude of the star is reduced by 0.23 as a result of gas and dust along the line of sight. 

Delta Cephei, found by John Goodricke in 1784, was only the second Cepheid variable discovered. It is very important because its distance is extremely well known. This is partly because it is in a star cluster, close enough for the precise Hubble Space Telescope/Hipparcos parallaxes to give a good result. As a result, it is known as a "fundamental distance calibrator", or absolute candle. Delta Cephei is a classical, or type I, Cepheid variable.

The only Cepheid variable closer to us is Polaris, the North Star, whose distance is still not exactly known.

Delta Cephei is emitting around 2,000 times the Sun's luminosity. This is producing a strong stellar wind, which, with the pulsations and shocks in the star's atmosphere, is ejecting mass at the rate of (1.0 ± 0.8) × 10–6 solar masses per year. This is the equivalent to the mass of the Sun roughly every million years. The matter is flowing outward at a velocity of about 350 km s–1. This expelled gas forms a nebula about one parsec across, centered on Delta Cephei, and contains 0.07–0.21 solar masses of neutral hydrogen. A bow shock is being formed where the stellar wind is colliding with the surrounding interstellar medium.

They were worn mostly by girls or young women, although middle-aged or elderly women sometimes wear the shoes. Comfort platforms were invented during the disco music era, and would be designed to mix added heights and sneaker style or orthotic comforts. The fad eventually fizzled out during the late 1980s and early 1990s, though by then people of all ages, particularly girls and young to middle-aged women, wore the shoes.

1930's

Moshe Kimel introduced the modern platform shoe in the 30's for actress Marlene Dietrich. This started a fad among the elite and well to do. The growing popularity of the shoe sparked several well known copies such as "the rainbow" by Salvatore Ferragamo https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvatore_Ferragamo. At this time the shoes were typically made with cork due to the production material changes many had to face during World War II. As many trends do this one slowly disappeared from the main stream media, and didn't reaper till the late 60's. 

1970's-1980's

Carole Basetta was the well known designer producing shoes for famous artists such as David Bowie https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bowie. This time it was not just a feminine fashion statement but men also wore platforms as well because platforms started coming in different forms like boots, trainers, and sandals. Tony Randell wore clear platforms with goldfish in the heals on a tv show and again these shoes appeared in Starsky and Hutch https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starsky_%26_Hutch. In the 80's brands popularized the comfort platform which was meant for everyday use.  

Late 90's early 2000's

While introduced in the early 90's platforms didn't pick up in mainstream fashion till the late 90's. This may be due to Naomi Campbell's runway fall in 1993 while wearing Vivienne Westwood's platform heels. After the 90's platforms did not pick up again till around 2003-2004 when YSL made a tribute sandal to commemorate the 70's shoe style. Many celebrities' liked this design for the added sex appeal.  

2010-2020

This era of platform shoe was more popular with the platform boot style. Some of the more well known brands are Demonia, Bordello, and Dolls kill. With the rise of E-girl as a subculture in 2019 the sale of gothic style platform boots have gone up. During the 2010 era clear shoes wear also popularized by Kim Kardashian West. These clear platform shoes allow to to put trinkets in your shoe ranging from flowers, kids toys, and plastic fish to Halloween decorations, spiders, and baby doll heads.

[[Nature (journal)]]

CATEGORIES: Science and technology magazines, Weekly magazines, Journals

Nature is a scientific journal.  It was first published on 4 November 1869. It is the world's most cited  scientific journal.  That means that, when scientists write formal reports of their experiments, they list all the earlier studies that they read in their reference section.  They list studies from Nature in their reference sections more than studies from any other journal. It is also the longest continuously published scientific weekly.

Most scientific journals are now specific to just one kind of science, for example only biochemistry or only mining science. Nature is one of the few journals which still publish original research articles across the whole range of science. Important new advances and original scientific research is published as articles or letters in Nature. Nature also prints surveys and reviews of important research fields.

Research scientists are the primary audience for the journal, but ordinary people read it as well. Because of this, articles are written and edited to make them understandable to scientists in other fields and any educated person. 

In the first pages of each issue are editorials, news and feature articles on issues of general interest to scientist. Topics include current affairs, science funding, business, scientific ethics and research breakthroughs. There are also sections on books and arts. Because of limits on the length of articles, often the printed text is a summary of the work in question. Details may be put in supplementary material on the journal's website.

Nature has spun off a series of more specialised journals which publish longer, more technical articles which would be unsuitable for Nature's wider readership.

The name Curse of Tippecanoe (also known as Tecumseh's Curse, the Presidential Curse, Zero-Year Curse, the Twenty-Year Curse, or the Twenty-Year Presidential Jinx) is used to describe the death of Presidents of the United States in office while elected or re-elected in a year ending in "0".

The "curse" began when President William Henry Harrison (elected in 1840) died in office from pneumonia just one month after becoming President.  According to a folk tale, the "curse" happened because then-General Harrison had fought on Native American grounds during the 1811 Battle of Tippecanoe.  The battle was famous, and "Old Tippecanoe" became Harrison's nickname.  But the battle made the Native Americans so angry that they cursed his name.

The last President included in this "curse" to die was John F. Kennedy.  He was elected in 1960 and assassinated in 1963.  Two later Presidents elected in "0" years: Ronald Reagan (1980), survived an assassination attempt and George W. Bush (2000), who also survived an assassination attempt. 

Current President Joe Biden would be next in line seeing how he was elected in 2020.

[[Gender role]]

CATEGORIES: Sociology

Gender role is the idea that people should behave in certain ways because of their gender. As an example, in a hunter-gatherer economy, men usually do more hunting and women do more gathering. In a money economy, it was traditionally the role of the man to earn money, and the role of the woman to educate the children. Such behavior may be a result of social and cultural factors. In the case it is the result of socialization.  There is still a discussion to what extent the observed behaviour is a function of the personality, and to what extent social factors play a role in the determination of gender-specific differences in behaviour.

Gender roles are dependent on the culture and history of the society that they are part of. While most cultures express two genders, some express more. Androgyny, for example, has been proposed as a third gender. Other societies have been claimed to have more than five genders, and some non-Western ones have three genders – man, woman and third gender. Gender expression refers to the external manifestation of one's gender identity, through "masculine," "feminine," or gender-variant or gender neutral behavior, clothing, hairstyles, or body characteristics.

The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women says that stereotyped gender role should be abolished.

[[Natural killer T cell]]

CATEGORIES: Blood cells

Natural killer T cells (NKT) are cells formed from small lymphocytes. They are a type of T cell, and are different from natural killer cells (NK). NKT cells are important, but make up only 0.1% of all peripheral blood T cells.

NKT cells are a subset of T cells which also have molecular markers normally associated with NK cells. They are important in recognizing glycolipids from organisms such as mycobacterium, which cause tuberculosis.

NKT cells seem to be essential for several aspects of immunity because their dysfunction or deficiency leads to the development of autoimmune diseases (such as diabetes and atherosclerosis) and cancer. NKT cells have recently been implicated in the disease progression of human asthma.

The clinical potential of NKT cells lies in the rapid release of cytokines that promote or suppress different immune responses.

[[Hyperbola]]

CATEGORIES: Conic sections

A hyperbola is a type of conic section. Like the other three types of conic sections - parabolas, ellipses, and circles - it is a curve formed by the intersection of a cone and a plane. A hyperbola is created when the plane intersects both halves of a double cone, creating two curves that look exactly like each other, but open in opposite directions. This occurs when the angle between the axis of the cone and the plane is less than the angle between a line on the side of the cone and the plane.

Hyperbolas can be found in many places in nature. For example, an object in open orbit around another object - where it never returns - can move in the shape of a hyperbola. On a sundial, the path followed by the tip of the shadow over time is a hyperbola.

[[Eta Carinae]]

CATEGORIES: Hypergiants

Eta Carinae (η Carinae or η Car) is a superbright hypergiant star in the constellation Carina, about 7,500 to 8,000 light-years from the Sun. 

The system contains at least two stars, of which the primary is a luminous blue variable (LBV) that initially had around 150 solar masses, of which it has lost at least 30. A hot supergiant of about 30 solar masses is in orbit around the primary. An enormous thick red nebula surrounding Eta Carinae makes it impossible to see this companion optically, but the dumbell-shaped gas cloud is formed by two stars. 

The Eta Carinae system is inside the Homunculus nebula, itself part of the much larger Carina nebula. Together they have a combined luminosity of over five million times the Sun's. It is not visible north of latitude 30°N and is seen moving round the pole south of latitude 30°S. Due to its mass and the stage of its life, it is expected to explode as a supernova in the future.

Countries that call themselves democratic republics do not always hold free or fair elections. For example, the German Democratic Republic, a socialist dictatorship. It also means that the citizens vote for who will the president be.

[[Mob rule]]

CATEGORIES: Forms of government, Political systems

Mob rule is sometimes called ochlocracy or mobocracy. There is sometimes no legal government, and mobs of people decide whatever they want. It is government by a mob (crowd of people). In this system, the mob becomes the ruler or dominant force in society. Actually, it is rare for a whole country to be under mob rule. More frequent is for part of the country to overthrow its leaders and be for a time without a government. Parts of a country may try to secede (break off) from the country. That has been quite common in certain parts of the world.

Mobs do have leaders, who make speeches complaining about what is wrong, and what they want instead of the legal government. Sometimes mods succeed in taking over the whole country (Russian revolution), sometimes they fail because the government succeeds in using force to stop them. The British decision to ban the trade of slaves (William Wilberforce) was fiercely resisted by the people who made money out of the trade. Slave trade mobs attacked the homes of people known to support abolition.

[[Demarchy]]

CATEGORIES: Political systems

Demarchy is a political system based on many decision-making groups that deal with specific functions in a given area (transport, parks, land use, etc.) The members that make up each group are chosen randomly every year. Democracy in Athens used this method to appoint officials.

This system is advantageous because it can not be influenced by pressure groups, media and others. In demarchy "political machines" or special preparation of candidates are not important because nobody can predict who will be in government next.

[[The Mark of Athena]]

CATEGORIES: Rick Riordan, Percy Jackson and the Olympians, Fantasy books

The Mark Of Athena is the third book of the Heroes of Olympus series by Rick Riordan. In this book, the perspective of the story moves between Percy Jackson, Annabeth Chase, Leo Valdez, Jason Grace, and Piper McLean. All of the seven demigods appear in this book.

In the beginning, the Argo II is approaching Rome (Camp Jupiter) when suddenly, a statue pops into existence on the ship and almost knocks Annabeth overboard. The statue is Terminus, the Roman god of boundaries. He yells that he will not accept having weapons over the Pomerian Line (the camp boundary). After being irritated by a curious Leo and a charmspeaking Piper, Terminus tells them to "surrender, then leave". Annabeth sees Percy walking down in Camp Jupiter with Hazel and Frank as if they were best friends, and knew she was too close to give up. (She also notices that Percy is a praetor now and signs that New Rome had recently been attacked by an army of monsters.) She asks if it was against the rules to hover OVER New Rome, as technically it wouldn't be on Roman soil. Terminus agrees grudgingly to this, but tells them to not harm his city.

[[Officer Creek]]

CATEGORIES: Rivers of South Australia

Officer Creek is a watercourse in the north-west of South Australia, on the Aṉangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Lands. It is normally mostly dry except for periods of very high rainfall. It runs from the Musgrave Ranges southward into the Great Victoria Desert. The only major community on Officer Creek is Kaltjiti.

The land around Officer Creek is part of the traditional homeland of the Pitjantjatjara and Yankunytjatjara. In September 1873, the explorer Ernest Giles and his team came to the creek during his second trip into the centre of Australia. At Kaltjiti, they encountered a large group of Aboriginal men. The Europeans fired shots from their rifles, allegedly because the Aboriginal people were throwing spears at them. Giles' group escaped unharmed, but did not report whether any of the Aboriginal men were hurt. He later acknowledged that aggression from the locals toward White people was usually due to them trespassing on sacred land. Giles may have interrupted an initiation or another kind of ceremony. Giles named the river "The Officer", and it was known by this name until the 1930s when it was renamed Officer Creek.

[[Lake Neale]]

CATEGORIES: Lakes of the Northern Territory

Lake Neale is a salt lake in the southwest corner of the Northern Territory, in Australia. It is on the north-west side of Lake Amadeus. The two lakes form part of a chain of salt lakes that stretches about 500, from Lake Hopkins in the west to the Finke River in the east. This drainage basin is known as the Amadeus Basin. The lake is usually a dry salt plain. It holds water for short periods after heavy rainfall. Lake Neale is on Aboriginal land, in the Petermann Aboriginal Land Trust. The Haasts Bluff lands are nearby to the north.

Lake Neale was named after Frank Neale, one of the pilots of an aerial expedition to accurately survey the desert regions northwest of Alice Springs in 1930. Neale flew one of the two planes that had been hired by explorer Donald Mackay for the expedition. The team made 15 survey flights over 24 days, in which they mapped the dimensions of Lakes Amadeus and Neale and found the even larger Lake Mackay, further to the north.

The first European to see Lake Neale was the explorer Ernest Giles in 1872. He had seen Kata Tjuta from far away and was making his way there. Lake Amadeus blocked his path. He also saw Lake Neale when he tried to reach Mount Unapproachable, on the northern side of the lake. He was coming from the east, and did not notice a land bridge between Neale and Amadeus. He mistook them as one big lake. William Tietkens corrected this mistake in an expedition of his own seventeen years later.

[[Polyphenism]]

CATEGORIES: Developmental biology, Genetics

Polyphenism is a kind of polymorphism where different forms of an animal are caused a single genotype. The animal inherits the capability, but the environment determines which form develops. This contrasts with genetic polymorphism, where each morph (form) inherits a slightly different genome.

Polyphenism occurs when the animal inherits a developmental switch. The switch is sensitive to some environmental cue or trigger. For example, the sex of crocodiles is determined by the prevailing temperature. Their gender is a polyphenic trait, and is not determined by the usual sex linkage.

[[Mount Unapproachable]]

CATEGORIES: Mountains of the Northern Territory

Mount Unapproachable is a mountain in the southwest of the Northern Territory, Australia. It is on the northern side of Lake Neale. It is about 505 above sea level. The area is far apart from other towns. The nearest towns are Kaltukatjara (116 km away), Kintore (135 km away) and Yulara (138 km away). The mountain is mostly made of sandstone.

The mountain was named by explorer Ernest Giles in 1872. Giles was on an expedition to find a way across the desert from east to west. He had just found and named Lake Amadeus. He could see the mountain rising to the west, and hoped to find water there. But, he was unable to get to the mountain because his path was blocked by the lake. Giles in fact over-estimated the size of Lake Amadeus and missed the bridge of land between Amadeus and Lake Neale.

In 1889, Giles' second-in-command, W. H. Tietkins, came back on his own expedition and surveyed the area. He wrote that he travelled to the Bloods Range, to the south of Lakes Amadeus and Neale. He named the highest peaks Mount Harris and Mount Carruthers. From the top of Mount Harris, he could see Kata Tjuṯa, the Petermann Ranges and the Tomkinson Ranges. Tietkins then travelled to the east for three days, and came to Lake Amadeus. At the western end of the lake and on the north shore, he described a sandstone range, which he named Long's Range after his brother-in-law. He climbed a nearby set of hills, and identified Mount Unapproachable as the westernmost peak of the Long's Range. He reported that his team reached Unapproachable around the middle of June and then spent several days travelling around the western edge of Lake Amadeus. He corrected Giles' earlier mistake and successfully mapped the lake's western shore.

Another team of surveyors visited the area in 1926, led by Donald Mackay and Herbet Basedow. On 1 July, they climbed a hill that Basedow identified as both Mount Unapproachable and Mount Harris. He found them to be the same mountain after comparing his own observations with those of Giles and Tietkens. Basedow decided that this hill was the Mount Unapproachable that Giles had described, and that Tietkens had mistakenly renamed it Mount Harris. But, on modern maps, Mount Harris and Mount Carruthers are the names given to two peaks in the Bloods Range.

[[Ketogenic diet]]

CATEGORIES: Nutrition

A ketogenic diet is a diet in which most of the calories come from fat (70-75%). A moderate amount of calories come from protein (20-25%). Only a small number of the calories come from carbohydrates (5%). 

The diet forces the body to burn fats rather than carbohydrates for energy. Normally, the carbohydrates you eat are turned into glucose in the body, which is used for energy around the body and in the brain. But, if you don't eat enough carbohydrates, your body has a back-up system of burning fat instead.  The liver can use stored fat and the fat you eat for energy. Stored fat is broken into two parts, fatty acids, and ketone bodies. Ketone bodies power the brain instead of glucose. This state of having a lot of ketone bodies in your blood is called "Ketosis." The liver can also make or release its own glucose through two processes(gluconeogenesis and glycogenolosis) as glucose is still needed for normal body function.

[[Dysthymia]]

CATEGORIES: Mood disorders

Dysthymia (also called dysthymic disorder or neurotic depression) is a type of mental illness called a mood disorder.  People with dysthymia have depression that is mild to moderate and lasts for years.

Dysthymia is a chronic (long-lasting) condition. A person must have symptoms for at least two years to qualify for a diagnosis of dysthymia.

The symptoms of dysthymia and major depressive disorder are similar. Both disorders can have serious effects on the body, mind, and emotions.  Physical symptoms can include changes in appetite, low energy, feeling tired, and trouble sleeping. Mental symptoms include difficulty making decisions or concentrating. Emotionally, people with either disorder often feel hopeless and have low self-esteem.  However, even though both disorders have similar symptoms, these symptoms are usually less severe with dysthymia.

Like with major depressive disorder, people with dysthymia may think about suicide or try to kill themselves. Dysthymia does not involve mania, hypomania (mild forms of mania), or mixed episodes (where a person has symptoms of both depression and mania).

Sometimes, people with dysthymia have "double depression."  This happens when a person with dysthymia has episodes of major depression (where their depression gets much worse) on top of their existing dysthymia.

Dysthymia usually affects adults, though it can affect teenagers. People who are diagnosed early (before age 22) usually have more severe relapses (where they return to being dysthymic after having been healthy), and are more likely to have other mental illnesses along with their dysthymia.

In early 2006, a group of researchers led by adventure writer Dan Buettner and supported by National Geographic Magazine, the National Institute for Aging, and Alliance Healthcare, designated Nicoya as a Blue Zone. This designation is granted to global regions that are characterized by the longest life expectancies.  Among the ideal Nicoyan lifestyle characteristics cited by the research were the water’s high calcium content, intense daily physical activity, year-long fruit consumption, and close inter-generational relationships.

While the town elected 61 year old Lorenzo Rosales Vargas as mayor on December 3, 2006 he was only able to serve for about a year before quitting due to health reasons. Since May 5, 2008 Eduardo Gutiérrez Rosales has been holding the office instead as Nicoya's first supply mayor. They are both members of the National Liberation Party (PLN).

[[First-move advantage]]

CATEGORIES: Chess

The first-move advantage in chess is the advantage of the player (White) who makes the first move in chess. Statistics of results on chess databases include almost all published games since 1851. In all forms of statistics, White scores better than Black for the main four opening moves 1.e4, 1.d4, 1.c4 and 1.Nf3.

White's overall winning percentage is calculated by taking the percentage of games won by White plus half the percentage of drawn games. Thus, if out of 100 games White wins 40, draws 32, and loses 28, White's total winning percentage is 40 plus half of 32, i.e. 56 percent. It is about the same for tournament games between humans and games between computers. White's advantage is less significant in rapid games or novice games.

Since about 1889, when World Champion Wilhelm Steinitz addressed this issue, the overwhelming consensus has been that a perfectly played game would end in a draw.

The highway is named after the prospector Harold Bell Lasseter, who claimed to have discovered a rich gold deposit (Lasseter's Reef) west of Kata Tjuṯa.

The highway begins in Erldunda, a roadhouse and hotel, on the Stuart Highway (N87). The Stuart Highway connects Darwin in the north and Adelaide in the south and is therefore one of Australia's major highways. From Erldunda, the Lasseter Highway leads west along the southern side of the Basedow and Kernot Ranges. After about 110 km, next to the Kernot Range, there is the junction with the Luritja Highway (S3), which leads north to Kings Canyon. Another 25 km towards the southwest is a rest area that has a view of Mount Conner. A further 22 km away is the Curtin Springs, a cattle station with a roadhouse. A further 100 km west along the highway is the tourist town Yulara. After Yulara, the road meets the Great Central Road, a dirt road that leads into Western Australia through the Petermann Ranges and across the Gibson and Great Victoria Deserts.

There are petrol stations at Erldunda (at the start of the highway), Mount Ebenezer (km 57) and Curtin Springs (km 245).

[[Earth's magnetic field]]

CATEGORIES: Earth, Magnetism

The Earth’s magnetic field is the magnetic field that surrounds the Earth. It is sometimes called the geomagnetic field.

The Earth’s magnetic field is created by the rotation of the Earth and Earth's core. It shields the Earth against harmful particles in space. The field is unstable and has changed often in the history of the Earth. As the Earth spins the two parts of the core move at different speeds and this is thought to generate the magnetic field around the Earth as though it had a large bar magnet inside it.

The magnetic field creates magnetic poles that are near to the geographical poles. A compass uses the geomagnetic field to find directions. Many migratory animals also use the field when they travel long distances each spring and fall.

The magnetic poles will trade places during a magnetic reversal.

[[Prolog]]

CATEGORIES: Programming languages

Prolog is a programming language that uses first order logic. It is the most used logic programming language. It is a declarative programming language. Alain Cormerauer, a French computer scientist created Prolog in the early 1970s.

Prolog is rather different from other programming languages. It uses facts and rules. Given the facts, the rules can be used to figure out new facts. 

Prolog also uses Horn clauses. It is a turing-complete programming language. 

[[Graupel]]

Graupel is a form of precipitation, which is very similar to snow and hail. However, hail falls almost always during severe thunderstorms. Snow falls during blizzards or snowstorms. Graupel often falls in wintry mixes, and usually falls apart during contact.

[[Horn clause]]

CATEGORIES: Logic, Computer science

A Horn clause is a logic disjunction of literals, where at most one of the literals is positive, and all the others are negative. It is named after Alfred Horn who described them in an article in 1951. 

A Horn clause with exactly one positive literal is a definite clause; a definite clause with no negative literals is sometimes called a “fact”; and a Horn clause without a positive literal is sometimes called a goal clause. These three kinds of Horn clauses are illustrated in the following propositional example:

In the non-propositional case, all variables in a clause are implicitly universally quantified with scope the entire clause. Thus, for example:

stands for:

which is logically equivalent to:

Horn clauses play a basic role in constructive logic and computational logic. They are important in automated theorem proving by first-order resolution, because the resolvent of two Horn clauses is itself a Horn clause, and the resolvent of a goal clause and a definite clause is a goal clause. These properties of Horn clauses can lead to greater efficiencies in proving a theorem (represented as the negation of a goal clause).

Horn clauses are also the basis of logic programming, where it is common to write definite clauses in the form of an implication:

In fact, the resolution of a goal clause with a definite clause to produce a new goal clause is the basis of the SLD resolution inference rule, used to implement logic programming and the programming language Prolog.

In logic programming a definite clause behaves as a goal-reduction procedure. For example, the Horn clause written above behaves as the procedure:

To emphasize this backwards use of the clause, it is often written in the backward form:

In Prolog this is written as:

The Prolog notation is actually ambiguous, and the term “goal clause” is sometimes also used ambiguously.  The variables in a goal clause can be read as universally or existentially quantified, and deriving “false” can be interpreted either as deriving a contradiction or as deriving a successful solution of the problem to be solved.

Van Emden and Kowalski (1976) investigated the model theoretic properties of Horn clauses in the context of logic programming, showing that every set of definite clauses D has a unique minimal model M. An atomic formula A is logically implied by D if and only if A is true in M. It follows that a problem P represented by an existentially quantified conjunction of positive literals is logically implied by D if and only if P is true in M. The minimal model semantics of Horn clauses is the basis for the stable model semantics of logic programs.

Propositional Horn clauses are also of interest in computational complexity, where the problem of finding truth value assignments to make a conjunction of propositional Horn clauses true is a P-complete problem (in fact solvable in linear time), sometimes called HORNSAT. (The unrestricted Boolean satisfiability problem is an NP-complete problem however.) Satisfiability of first-order Horn clauses is undecidable.

[[Venn diagram]]

CATEGORIES: Set theory

A Venn diagram is a diagram that shows the logical relation between sets. They were popularised by John Venn in the 1880s, and are now widely used. They are used to teach elementary set theory, and to illustrate simple set relationships in probability, logic, statistics, linguistics and computer science. A Venn diagram uses closed curves drawn on a plane to represent sets. Very often, these curves are circles or ellipses. 

Similar ideas had been proposed before Venn. Christian Weise in 1712 (Nucleus Logicoe Wiesianoe) and Leonhard Euler (Letters to a German Princess) in 1768, for instance, came up with similar ideas. The idea was popularised by Venn in Symbolic Logic, Chapter V "Diagrammatic Representation", 1881.

[[Dopamine reuptake inhibitor]]

CATEGORIES: Neurology, Drugs

A dopamine reuptake inhibitor (DRI) is a drug. Dopamine is a type of brain chemical called a neurotransmitter. Dopamine has many jobs and responsibilities in the brain. Scientists think dopamine controls movement and the human sense of punishment and reward. Dopamine affects dreams, motivation, and sexual gratification, too.

A lack of dopamine is responsible for many diseases and conditions. Sometimes dopamine does not work correctly in the brain. Sometimes the brain does not have enough dopamine. Doctors prescribe dopamine reuptake inhibitors (DRI's or DARI's) to help control symptoms. Psychostimulants and antidepressants are types of DRI's. DRI's help manage symptoms of ADHD, narcolepsy, Parkinson's Disease, obesity, substance abuse withdrawal and some mood disorders. Users can become addicted to DRI's sometimes.

DRI's do not have dopamine inside the pills. They help the body make more dopamine, and they change the way dopamine is re-used in the brain.

Sir Thomas Elder (August 5, 1817—March 6, 1897) was a Scottish businessman who moved to South Australia and set up the largest wool selling company in the world.

Elder came to South Australia in 1854. He worked with his brother George, and then became a business partners with Edward Stirling, Robert Barr Smith and John Taylor. They spent money setting up the copper mines at Moonta and Wallaroo which made them all very rich. When Stirling and Taylor retired, Elder and Smith became Elder Smith and Company. This company became the biggest wool selling company in the world.

Elder spent money buying large properties for sheep in outback South Australia, Queensland and Western Australia. Some of these included Paratoo, Umberatana, Mount Lyndhurst, Blanchewater and Beltana. He had ridden camels while on holiday in Palestine, and thought they would be good for use in the Australian deserts. He brought 124 camels and Afghan people to breed camels at Beltana. These were used for the building of the Australian Overland Telegraph. Elder provided money and camels for exploration by Peter Egerton Warburton (1872-73), Ernest Giles (1875), John Ross (1874), Lewis (1875), and the Royal Geographical Society of South Australia (1891).

He became a member of the South Australian Parliament Legislative Council in 1863-69 and 1871-78. He became interested in horse racing and set up stables at Morphetville. He built a grand Scottish style house at Mount Lofty, which was where he died in 1897.

He was a very rich man, and gave money to many organizations in South Australia. This included £26,000 for the University of Adelaide, £20,000 for mathematics and general science, £31,000 to the Medical School, and £21,000 to the School of Music. In his will he gave £10,000 to the Presbyterian Church, £4000 for the Church of England cathedral, £4000 for the Methodist Prince Alfred College, £25,000 to set up a Working Men's Home, and £16,000 to the hospital.

Heinrich Wilhelm Schott was an Austrian botanist well known for his extensive work on aroids (Family Araceae).

He was born on 7 January 1794 in Brno, a city in Moravia that in those years was part of the Austrian Empire and that now is part of the Czech Republic. As a young boy, he came to live in Vienna, where his father was the chief gardener of the botanical garden of the university.

He studied botany, agriculture and chemistry at the University of Vienna, where he was a student of the botanist Joseph Franz von Jacquin (1766-1839). In 1815 he became gardener at the garden for the Austrian flora at the Belveder palace.

He was a participant in the Austrian Brazil Expedition from 1817 to 1821. While in Brazil from mid-1817 through 1821, Schott established and managed an introduction garden for accustoming living plants to more temperate climates in order to have them brought to Europe at a later date, made field trips, and prepared many notes concerning the plants and animals he saw.

In 1821 Schott returned to Vienna, where he worked as gardener again. In 1828 he was appointed Hofgärtner (Royal Gardener) in Vienna, later serving as director of the Imperial Gardens at Schönbrunn Palace (1845). In 1852 he was in charge of transforming part of palace gardens in the fashion of an English garden. He also enriched the Viennese court gardens with his collections from Brazil.

He was interested in plants that grow in high mountains, above the tree line, He developed a garden with that kind of plants (an alpine garden) at Belvedere in Vienna.

He died at the Schönbrunn Palace, Vienna, on 5 March 1865.

[[Coobool Creek]]

CATEGORIES: Archaeological sites in Australia, History of Australia, New South Wales

Coolbool Creek is an archaeological site site near the Wakool River in New South Wales, Australia. It is about half way between Swan Hill and Deniliquin. The site is near Doherty's Hut at Coobool Crossing, although the exact spot is unknown. 

G. M. Black found 126 skulls at the site in 1950. It has been difficult to give an exact age for the skulls, but one has been dated to 14,300 years ago. Some of the skulls also show artificial cranial deformation. The age, location, and deformities make the site similar to another Pleistocene site at Kow Swamp. Some scientists have said that this shows they were part of the same population, but others have disagreed. Because Coolbool Creek skulls were found on the surface it is difficult to date them, and other scientists have argued that they might be much older.

The skulls were kept at the University of Melbourne until 1984. They were returned to the local Aboriginal communities and reburied.

[[Birksgate Range]]

CATEGORIES: Mountain ranges of Australia, Mountains of South Australia

The Birksgate Range is a scattered group of mountains in the northwest of South Australia. It is on the northeast edges of the Great Victoria Desert. It spreads for about 100 from Iltur in the southeast to Watarru in the northwest. The northern portion of it is protected in the Watarru Indigenous Protected Area. The range consists of granitic rock protrusions that have been weathered into rounded and rugged hills. They are not visibly connected to each other. Each are separated by flat plains and sand dunes. The mountains are fairly low in elevation; they are highest at the northern end.

Prominent peaks in the range include the following: Mounts Lindsay (819 m) and Wooltarlinna are at the northeastern end of the range, near Watarru. Further southwest are Mounts Holder and Sir Thomas (773 m). From here the range spreads southeast along the edge of the desert and the hills generally become lower and more widely dispersed. Mount Poondinna (678 m) is the highest peak in the central part of the range. Mounts Cheesman and Yaroona (also spelled Yaruna) are further to the southeast. The southern end of the range is at Iltur (Coffin Hill).

The Birksgate Range was named by the explorer David Lindsay, who led the Elder Scientific Exploring Expedition across the Great Victoria Desert between April 1891 and March 1892. He named the range for the man who funded and equipped their expedition, Sir Thomas Elder. "Birksgate" was the name of Elder's house in Adelaide.

His ancestors are said by different sources to be from Persia, Afghanistan, Arabia, and Ferghana in present day Uzbekistan.

Tipu Sultan was born in Devanahalli in 1750. The birthplace of Tipu Sultan, located very close to the Devanahalli Fort is just a small pillared enclosure with a stone tablet which declares the place to be the birth place of Tipu Sultan. The area around the enclosure is known as Khas Bagh.

Tipu sultan introduced several new laws, including new coinage, a new lunisolar calendar and a new land revenue system. He(Tipu sultan) started the growth of the silk industry in Mysore. Tipu inherited a large kingdom bordered by the Krishna River in the south, the Eastern Ghats in the east and the Arabian Sea in the west.

[[Barabbas]]

CATEGORIES: New Testament people, Ancient Israeli people

Barabbas is a person from the Bible who lived around the time of Jesus (33 AD). He has a bad reputation for being a liar, thief, insurrectionist and zealot. He was released by Pontius Pilate the Roman governor of Judea who presided over Jesus' trial. The most notable thing about Barabbas is that this name was his surname (last name), but his first name was also Jesus. So when Pilate — who was warned by his wife to leave this Holy man alone — offered to set free one of the prisoners, he was offering the crowd in Jerusalem two Jesuses to choose from: Jesus Barabbas or Jesus of Nazareth. Pilate released Barabbas and ordered Jesus, "King of the Jews", to be crucified.

[[Wolf–Rayet star]]

CATEGORIES: Types of stars

Wolf–Rayet stars (WR stars) are evolved, massive stars (over 20 solar masses initially). They are losing mass rapidly by means of a very strong stellar wind, with speeds up to 2000 km/s. While our own Sun loses about 10−14 solar masses every year, Wolf–Rayet stars typically lose 10−5 solar masses a year.

Wolf–Rayet stars are extremely hot, with surface temperatures in the range of 30,000 K to around 200,000 K that make them look blue in color. They are also highly luminous, from tens of thousands to several million times the bolometric luminosity of the Sun, although not exceptionally bright visually since most of their output is in far ultraviolet and even "soft" X-rays.

The rock is made up of quartzite and sandstone rock, resting on slates of kaolinised clay. At the eastern end of the range is Mount Chandler, which overlooks the settlement of Indulkana and the Indulkana Creek. It rises about 140 from its base. It is made up of quartzite, quartz sandstone and sandstone. Slightly north of the escarpment, and following its path from east to west, is a series of gorges that split the hills. The gorges contain several reliable springs.

[[Hydrazone]]

A hydrazone is the functional group with structure R1R2C=NNH2. They are like aldehydes or ketones, with an NNH2 group instead of the oxygen atom.

They are made by reacting hydrazines with ketones or aldehydes:

Hydrazones are very useful molecules to do some reactions. For example, a ketone can be reduced down completely if made into a hydrazine and then treated with sodium ethoxide (Wolff–Kishner reduction). Hydrazones are very important intermediates in many reactions, such as the Fischer indole synthesis. This makes indoles, groups which are found in many drugs.

[[Reaction intermediate]]

CATEGORIES: Chemical kinetics

A reaction intermediate or simply intermediate is a molecule that is formed during a chemical reaction. It is not the final product, but it is something that is more like the product than the reactants. After every step in a reaction mechanism, an intermediate is formed.

Intermediates usually stay around for a little time because they are very reactive. However, it is important not to confuse an intermediate with a transition state. The latter is at a point of maximum energy. An intermediate instead is at a point of minimum energy, i.e. it is a stable molecule. Intermediates can be isolated from a reaction if needed. 

For example, in the reaction:

A + B → X → C + D

X is the intermediate. In going from A + B to X and from X to C + D, the reaction will go through a transition state.

Wolf 359 is a red dwarf in the constellation Leo first measured in 1919 by Max Wolf. About 7.8 light years from the Earth, it has an apparent magnitude of 13.5 and can only be seen with a large telescope. 

Wolf 359 is one of the nearest stars to the Solar System. Only the Alpha Centauri system (including Proxima Centauri), Barnard's Star, and WISE 1049-5319 are closer. It is mentioned in several works of fiction.

Wolf 359 is one of the faintest and lowest-mass stars known. At the light-emitting layer called the photosphere, it has a temperature of about 2,800 K, which is low enough for chemical compounds to form and survive. The absorption lines of compounds such as water and titanium(II) oxide are in the spectrum. 

The surface has a magnetic field which is stronger than the average magnetic field on the Sun. As a result of magnetic activity caused by convection, Wolf 359 is a flare star that has sudden increases in luminosity for several minutes. These flares give off strong bursts of X-ray and gamma ray radiation. Wolf 359 is a relatively young star with an age of less than a billion years. No companions or disks of debris have been detected in orbit around it.

[[Feral]]

CATEGORIES: Animals, Plants

A feral organism is a plant or animal which has changed from being tame or cultivated to being wild. 

A feral animal is one which has escaped from a domestic or captive status and is living more or less as a wild animal. Animals which were wild before they escaped from captivity are not regarded as feral. For example, a lion which has escaped from a zoo is not a feral animal. Some common examples of animals with feral populations are goats, cats, and pigs.  

Domesticated plants that revert to wild are usually known as escaped, introduced or naturalized rather than feral. However, the changes seen in plants that go wild is similar to those of animals.

Some species go feral easily and successfully. Other species usually do not usually survive in the wild.

The introduction of animals or plants to new areas may break down ecosystems. In some cases it has caused the extinction native species. However, returning lost species to their environment can have the opposite effect, bringing damaged ecosystems back into balance. However, sometimes feral species may control other problem species such as rodents, harmful insects, or aggressive plants.

Barbara Ann Scott (May 9, 1928 – September 30, 2012) was a Canadian figure skater. Scott was born in Ottawa, Ontario. She was a champion in the 1948 Winter Olympics, a two-time World Champion and a four time Canadian national champion. She was known as "Canada's Sweetheart" when she returned. Admirers greeted her as she returned from the 1948 Olympic games, and March 9th was then declared Barbara Ann Scott Day. In that very same skating season, she dominated North American, European, and World championships, and did this all at a young age.

She was the only Canadian to win the Olympic ladies' singles gold medal, the first North American to win three major titles in one year and the only Canadian to win a European Championship. Long after her victory, sixty-one years later, Scott carried the Olympic torch into the chamber before the 2010 Vancouver Olympic games. Two months later, she carried the Olympic flag along with seven other Canadians into the Opening Ceremonies.

Barbara was a great figure skater. It is an honor to be able to carry both the Olympic torch and the Olympic flag. She was known well by all of the people in Ottawa, Ontario, where she was born. Barbara was truly a wonderful figure skater for Canada in ladies’ singles (skating by themselves).

Scott died on September 30, 2012 at her home in Fernandina Beach, Amelia Island, Florida at age 84. A local arena was named after her in Nepean, Ontario, as part of the Pinecrest Recreation Centre.

[[Fork bomb]]

CATEGORIES: Computer security

A fork bomb is a way of stopping a computer from running by making many copies of a program. A fork bomb copies itself into more than two copies, which then copy themselves into four copies. Then both the original and the copy will keep making copies until the computer can no longer handle it and crash.

For example, a simple fork bomb using the bash shell script is :

Here, a function is defined by the name " : ". Inside the curly braces, this function is called and its output is given again to the same function. The " & " is used to run the process in background. The semicolon (" ; ") marks end of the function. The last colon (" : ") calls the function for first time. After that the function keeps on calling itself until computer runs out of memory.

[[Tutu (plant)]]

CATEGORIES: Cucurbitales, New Zealand

Tutu is a common name of Māori origin for plants in the genus Coriaria (Coriariaceae) found in New Zealand.

Six New Zealand native species are known by the name:

They are shrubs or trees; some are endemic to New Zealand. Most of the plant parts are poisonous, containing the neurotoxin tutin.

Both the seeds and sap of tutu are highly poisonous, resulting in many cattle deaths in the early days of European settlement. After removing the poisonous seeds, Māori people prepared a drink from the fruit, which they often boiled with a type of seaweed (rimu). The resulting jelly (rehia) was then fermented.

Honey containing tutin can be produced by honey bees feeding on honeydew produced by sap-sucking vine hopper insects (Scolypopa australis) feeding on tutu. The toxin is in the sap of the Tutu bush. This sap is eaten by the hoppers, but not all is digested. The undigested sap which contains a lot of plant sugars as well as tutin is excreted as honeydew onto the leaves of the bush. Bees then gather the honeydew and toxic honey is the result.

The last recorded deaths from eating honey containing tutin were in Northland, New Zealand, in 1890, although sporadic outbreaks of toxic honey poisoning continue to occur. Poisoning symptoms include delirium, vomiting, and coma.

[[Pest control]]

CATEGORIES: Agricultural pests, Pests, Gardening

Pest control is group of methods to control some species of animals and plants that are considered by humans as harmful to their health, economy or ecology.

Pest control is as old as agriculture, as there has always been a need to keep crops free from pests. In order to get best results from food production there was always need to protect crops from competing plants trying to kill the crops to grow in its place.

Managing or controlling pests can be done with a number of methods. Killing them is often done (using the services of an exterminator or doing it yourself), but there are methods of humane pest control available too. These include using sound to deter or repel pests and making changes around the property to prevent pests from entering. 

Insects and wildlife enter buildings primarily to seek food, shelter, and warmth. The areas typically affected are the attic, the basement, and the roof. Homeowners can do some things to help ensure we don't provide an environment that's attractive to pests.

[[Equivocation]]

CATEGORIES: Logical fallacies, Epistemology, Linguistics

Equivocation is a fallacy when a word has more than one meaning and the person arguing confuses the multiple meanings of the word to prove an argument correct. For example, "All trees have bark. All dogs bark. Therefore, all dogs are trees." This is a fallacy because the two times "bark" is used in the argument have very different meanings from each other, while in the argument, the word "bark" should have the same meaning the whole argument. The first meaning of "bark" is the outer layer of a tree, and the second meaning is a shouting sound that a dog makes. The argument does not work because the person changed the meaning of "bark" in the middle of the argument.

[[Aboriginal Land Trust]]

CATEGORIES: Aboriginal Land Trusts

In Australia, an Aboriginal Land Trust (ALT) is a type of non-profit organisation that holds the freehold title to an area of land on behalf of a community of Aboriginal Australians. The land is granted to a community by the government under a perpetual lease, usually after the community makes a legal claim of traditional ownership. Land granted under Aboriginal title is inalienable, meaning it can not be bought, sold, traded or given away. The Land Trust is the organisation appointed by the community to legally hold the title deeds.

Several states and territories have enacted laws to establish Aboriginal Land Trusts, but not all. In South Australia, there is a single Aboriginal Lands Trust. It was created under the Aboriginal Lands Trust Act, 1966. It holds title to Aboriginal land in South Australia and organises the management and control of those lands. The Aboriginal Lands Trust in Western Australia was created by the Aboriginal Affairs Planning Authority Act, 1972. It acquires and holds land and manages it for the benefit of Aboriginal communities. It holds about 27 million hectares (11%) of the state's land, most of which was previously held by the state government. In Queensland, there are multiple Land Trusts. They were created under the state's Aboriginal Land Act, 1991. In the Northern Territory, Land Trusts are governed under the Aboriginal Land Rights Act, 1976, which also governs the way in which groups can make claims to land. The ALTs hold the title to land handed back to the traditional Aboriginal owners through the Land Rights Act.

[[Petermann Aboriginal Land Trust]]

[[Short-term memory]]

CATEGORIES: Memory, Brain

Short term memory is the ability to keep information in mind for a short amount of time. Remembering a phone number long enough to find a piece of paper is an example. The brain keeps information in its short term memory for a small period of time. The amount of time the mind is able to do this is usually some seconds.

The opposite of short-term memory is long-term memory, which is where things are stored in the brain for a long time. These items may be recalled later, or there may be difficulty recalling them.

[[Celestial equator]]

CATEGORIES: Astronomy

The celestial equator is a term in observational astronomy. It is a great circle on the imaginary celestial sphere, in the same plane as the Earth's equator. In other words, it is a projection of the terrestrial equator out into space.  As a result of the Earth's axial tilt, the celestial equator is inclined by 23.4° with respect to the ecliptic plane.

An observer standing on the Earth's equator visualizes the celestial equator as a semicircle passing directly overhead through the zenith. As the observer moves north (or south), the celestial equator tilts towards the southern (or northern) horizon. At the poles, the celestial equator is parallel to the horizon.

The observer always sees the ends of the semicircle disappear over the horizon exactly due east and due west, regardless of the observer's position on Earth.

[[Interstellar travel]]

CATEGORIES: Astronomy, Engineering

Interstellar space travel is manned or unmanned travel between stars. Interstellar travel is much more difficult than travel within the Solar System, though travel in starships is a staple of science fiction. Actually, there is no suitable technology at present. However, the idea of a probe with an ion engine has been studied. The energy would come through a laser base station.

Given sufficient travel time and engineering work, both unmanned and sleeper ship interstellar travel seem possible. Both present considerable technological and economic challenges which are unlikely to be met in the near future, particularly for manned probes. NASA, ESA and other space agencies have done research into these topics for several years, and have worked out some theoretical approaches.

Energy requirements appear to make interstellar travel impractical for "generation ships", but less so for heavily shielded sleeper ships.

Further east, the range splits into several branches, including the Rowley Range, McNichol's Range and the Pinyinna Range.

Bloods Range was given its name on 14 March 1874 by the explorer Ernest Giles, when he saw it from the top of Mount Curdie. He named it after the owner of an early pastoral station in South Australia, whose surname was "Blood". On 12 June 1889, Giles' second-in-command, W. H. Tietkins, returned on his own expedition and surveyed the range. He named the two highest peaks Mount Harris and Mount Carruthers. From the top of Mount Harris, he wrote that he could see Kata Tjuṯa, the Petermann Ranges and the Tomkinson Ranges.

[[Transplant (surgery)]]

CATEGORIES: Surgery, Organs, Transplants

Transplants are a type of surgery. Both tissues and organs can be transplanted. Types of transplant:

An organ transplant is a kind of surgery where the person being operated on will need an organ replaced, and gets a healthy one from someone else, a donor. Usually the organ is taken from someone who is recently deceased, except for organs like bone marrow or kidneys, which can be taken without harming the donor too much.

The critical problem with all transplants is transplant rejection by the host's immune system. Unless the host and donor are a very close genetic match, the host's immune system will reject the transplant. To stop this happening, drugs are used to suppress, or limit, the host's immune system. This in turn makes the host more vulnerable to various kinds of infection.

To keep this problem to a minimum, transplants are only done when surgeons are satisfied that the host and donor are a fairly close match. Tests are done to see how good a match the donor's organ or tissue is to the proposed host.

Appalachian English is a dialect of the English language. It is spoken in the Appalachian Mountains region. Research suggests it is one of the most unique dialects in the United States. 

Since the 1930s, a lot of research has been done to figure out where the dialect came from. One theory is that the dialect is a remnant of Elizabethan (or Shakespearean) English that had been preserved by the region's isolation. Another theory suggests that the dialect developed out of the Scots-Irish and Anglo-Scottish border dialects brought to the region by some of its earliest British Isles settlers, who were from the border of Scotland and England.  

Recent research suggests that Appalachian English developed as a uniquely American dialect as early settlers adapted English to their unfamiliar frontier environment. This is supported by many similarities between the Appalachian dialect and Colonial American English.

[[Carnaval]]

CATEGORIES: Solo piano pieces, Compositions by Robert Schumann, Ballets

Carnaval, Op. 9, is a work for piano solo by Robert Schumann. It was written in 1834-1835. Subtitled Scènes mignonnes sur quatre notes (Little Scenes on Four Notes). the work is a collection of short pieces representing masked revelers at a festival. Schumann, his friends and colleagues, and characters from improvised Italian comedy (commedia dell’arte) are all depicted musically in the work. Carnaval is centered on four notes which had special meaning for Schumann: A, E-flat, C, B - signified in German as A-S-C-H. Each piece has a title, and the work as a whole is a musical representation of an elaborate masked ball during carnival season. Both Schumann and his wife, Clara, thought his solo piano works too difficult for the general public. They were rarely performed in Schumann's lifetime. Franz Liszt however performed selections from Carnaval in Leipzig in 1840.  Today, the work is one of Schumann's most often performed works. The work was orchestrated in the early 20th century for a ballet produced for the Ballets Russes which starred Nijinsky.   

[[Symphony No. 1 "Spring" (Schumann)]]

CATEGORIES: Compositions by Robert Schumann, Symphonies

Symphony No. 1 in B flat major, Op. 38 ("Spring")  is the first of Robert Schumann's four symphonies. It was written early 1841. Schumann sketched the symphony in four days from 23 January to 26 January. He completed the orchestration by 20 February. The premiere took place under the direction of Felix Mendelssohn on 31 March 1841 in Leipzig. The symphony was well received. Schumann was largely known for his piano works and for songs at the time. His wife Clara Schumann encouraged him to write symphonic music. Schumann said he was inspired by his Liebesfrühling (spring of love) in the symphony's composition. 

The work has four movements: Andante un poco maestoso – Allegro molto vivace (B flat major); Larghetto (E flat major; Scherzo: Molto vivace – Trio I: Molto piu vivace – Trio II (G minor); and Allegro animato e grazioso (B flat major). The orchestration is for 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 4 horns, 2 trumpets, 3 trombones, timpani, triangle and strings. Schumann expanded the use of the timpani in this piece.  He made some revisions in the work until the definitive edition was published in 1853.

[[Annual percentage rate]]

CATEGORIES: Money

The term annual percentage rate (APR), also called nominal APR, and the term effective APR, means the interest rate for a whole year, rather than just a monthly fee/rate, as applied on a loan, mortgage loan, or credit card. This rate is useful when buying a car, a house, or any other expensive possession. Since few people are able to afford to pay the full price, many sellers choose to divide the price into monthly payments and a down payment. This makes things easier to buy. Once the buyer pays the down payment, he or she enters into an agreement to pay the remaining months. But since the buyer has not paid the entire amount yet, the seller is essentially lending part of the purchase to the buyer. This is where interest rates come in. The seller charges the monthly payments with a part or a percentage of the remaining amount. This amount gets added onto the monthly payment. Some companies force the buyer to pay the interest first, and the remaining amount pays the original loaned amount, called the principal.

[[Donkey Kong Jungle Beat]]

CATEGORIES: Donkey Kong, Nintendo GameCube games, Platform games, 2004 video games

Donkey Kong Jungle Beat is a platform video game for the Nintendo GameCube game console. It was released in Japan on December 16, 2004, in Europe on February 4, 2005, and in North America on March 14, 2005. It is played with the DK Bongos controller.

The game involves combat, platforming, and counterattacking (attacking enemies after they attack you). Players use the left drum to move left, the right drum to move right, and both drums to jump. Clapping or hitting the sides of the drums causes Donkey Kong to clap. Clapping produces a small small red ring and a bigger green one. Enemies that are in the red ring are usually defeated, and those that are in the green ring are usually stunned. Stunned enemies can be killed by jumping on them and hitting the drums repeatedly. The goal is not just to get to the end of the level, but also to get as many "beats" (points) as the player can. Beats are gotten by grabbing bananas, and lost by being hit or falling. More beats can be gotten by doing combos while grabbing bananas.

The level system involves several "kingdoms." Each kingdom has three platforming levels. At the end of each kingdom is a boss. There are four species of bosses. Each species of boss has different fighting styles and ways of defeating. After a boss is defeated, the number of beats is counted, and the player earns a crest depending on how many were gotten. The crests are as follows:

In 2008 and 2009, Donkey Kong Jungle Beat was one of the games released as part of the "New Play Control!" series of remade Nintendo GameCube games for the Wii. It features new and changed levels along with more traditional controls that use the analog stick to move and the A button to jump.

[[Ice core]]

CATEGORIES: Climate change

An ice core is a long piece of ice taken from a glacier. The ice is drilled very deep, so that the ice core goes back to old ice at the bottom of the glacier. Usually, ice cores are taken from Antarctica, Greenland or very high mountains.

Snow falls on ground and accumulates (gets deeper). As more snow falls, the bottom layers get compacted (thinner) because of the weight on top. In the end, only ice remains, and all air goes away. The deeper the ice, the older it is. Ice cores can be dated by looking at the layers: often every season can be seen in the ice core because it forms a layer. At other times it is more difficult to find out how old the ice is. Other methods can be used, like measuring conductivity or making mathematical models.

Scientists study ice cores to find out how the climate was in the past. The ice keeps information like gases, particles, ash from volcanoes. The type of water that forms the ice can be used to calculate the temperature of Earth.

Ice cores help us know what the temperature was on the planet in the past 800 thousand years. We know more about ice ages that happen periodically. This is a helpful addition to our knowledge about global warming.

Milutin Milanković  (28 May 1879 – 12 December 1958) was a Serbian mathematician, astronomer, geophysicist, climatologist, civil engineer and writer. Milanković made two fundamental contributions to science. 

The first contribution was the "Canon of the Earth’s insolation", which explained the climates of the planets of the Solar system. He founded cosmic climatology by calculating temperatures of the upper layers of the Earth's atmosphere as well as the temperature conditions on planets of the inner Solar system, Mercury, Venus, Mars, and the Moon, as well as the depth of the atmosphere of the outer planets. 

The second contribution was his explanation of how the Earth's long-term climate changes are caused by changes in Earth's spin and orbit around the Sun. These are now known as Milankovich cycles. They explain the ice ages which occurred in the geological past of the Earth, and predict climate changes on the Earth which may be expected in the future. 

The explanation is not entirely accurate, so no doubt there are other factors also at work. These other factors would be such things as how much oxygen and carbon dioxide are in the atmosphere, the position of the continents, the amount of volcanic action, and so on. However, the cycles of climate do seem broadly to go as Milankovic predicted. Geological evidence from rhythmical features in sedimentary rocks are common.

Talgai is an archaeological site, near Allora on the Darling Downs, south east of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. In 1884 a Pleistocene era skull was found in Dalrymple Creek after a big flood. It was found by William Naish, a shearer, who was building a fence at the East Talgai station. The skull was that of a 14 year old boy who had lived about 11,000 years ago. Naish gave the skull to the owners of the station. It was purchased by the University of Sydney in 1914. It was the first fossil found which showed the early human occupation of Australia.

The skull was heavily encrusted with calcium carbonate and the shape had been distorted during long time buried in the ground. At first scientists thought it was a primitive skull with ape like teeth. Later study showed that the skull was a modern Homo sapien, the teeth were normal, but heavily worn. The boy had a massive injury to the side of his skull which was probably what had killed him.

In 1968 a Tom Haydon made a documentary movie, The Talgai Skull: An Investigation Into the Origin of the Australian Aborigines. It won the Australian Film Institute award for Best Documentary.

Tokyo is in a part of Japan called the Kantō Plain. Two big rivers run through Tokyo. One is the Arakawa River which runs from the north to the south, and flows into Tokyo Bay. The other is the Tama River which runs from the west to the east. The Tama River is a border between Tokyo and its neighbor city, Kawasaki.

[[Ring of Brodgar]]

CATEGORIES: Prehistoric buildings and structures, Archaeological sites in Scotland, Henges, Stone circles, Orkney, Neolithic

The Ring of Brodgar is a Neolithic henge and stone circle on Mainland, the largest island in Orkney, Scotland. It is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site known as the Heart of Neolithic Orkney.

The stone circle is 104 in diameter, and the third largest in the British Isles. The ring originally comprised 60 stones, of which only 27 remained standing at the end of the 20th century. The tallest stones stand at the south and west of the ring.

The stones are set in a circular ditch up to 3 deep, 9 wide and 380 in circumference that was carved out of the solid sandstone bedrock by the ancient residents. Technically, this ditch does not constitute a true henge as there is no sign of an encircling bank of earth and rock. However, many archaeologists refer to this structure as a henge. Aubrey Burl classifies the ditch as a Class II henge; one that has two opposing entrances, in this case on the north-west and south-east.

The Ring is in a significant ritual landscape. Within 2 there are the two circle-henges, four chambered tombs, groups of standing stones, single stones, barrows, cairns, and mounds. A number of flint arrowheads and broken stone mace-heads were found nearby. They seem to date from the Bronze Age. The nearby Standing Stones of Stenness and its Maeshowe tomb help to make the Ring of Brodgar a site of major importance.

[[Gliese 581]]

CATEGORIES: Red dwarfs

Gliese 581 is an M-class red dwarf star that is not far from the Earth.  It is 22 light years away from the Solar system.  This makes it the 89th closest known star to the Sun.  It is also known as HO Librae, GL 581, or GJ 581.

Astronomers  have discovered some planets that orbit Gliese 581.  The astronomers agree that four of the planets are real, but some think there are two more planets.

Gliese 581 has a radius, and mass, about a third that of the Sun.  Its estimated temperature  is 3,498 Kelvin (4125 Celsius, 7457 Fahrenheit).  Its luminosity is 0.01205 times the luminosity of the Sun.

People on Earth can see Gliese 581 in the constellation Libra.  The star's apparent magnitude is 10.57.  This means that a person on Earth would need to use a telescope to see Gliese 581, because the star is not bright enough for the naked eye to see.

[[EPR paradox]]

CATEGORIES: Quantum mechanics

The EPR paradox is an early and strong criticism of quantum mechanics. Albert Einstein and his co-workers, Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen, said that Niels Bohr, Werner Heisenberg, and the other scientists in Copenhagen were wrong about uncertainty. Heisenberg claimed that you could never know, for any one time, both the position and momentum (or velocity, or trajectory) of any atom-sized or smaller particle. The idea was that the two could not be measured at the same time, and that as soon as one was measured a change would occur and you would not get the same answer for the other one that you would have gotten if you had measured it first. Einstein and his group said that Heisenberg should think again. Suppose you had two very small particles. You measured the weight of each of them and then stuck them together. You gave them a little push. Then something broke them apart. They should have both positions and velocities that were related. So if you measured the position of one of them, then even if you assumed that Heisenberg was right and you could not involve messing up its velocity in the process of measuring it, surely that did not mean that it never had a definite velocity. For proof, Einstein said that you could next measure the velocity of the second particle and, since everything was mathematically related, you would then know the velocity of the first particle. 

There was one way that Heisenberg could be right, a reason that Einstein thought was nonsense: What if measuring the position of the first particle would mess up the velocity of the second particle. That would be like magic. How could anybody explain such an influence? Suppose that the two particles were moving away very fast and a long time had gone by. If something that happened to the first particle somehow influenced the second particle, its influence would have to travel faster than the speed of light, which is impossible. Physicists like Erwin Schrödinger suggested that maybe the relationship in position and velocity would just gradually go away somehow. Schrödinger called the connection between the two particles (and anything like it that happened to other things) "entanglement." 

"Spooky action at a distance," as Einstein called it, is one way of understanding this paradox. Einstein had no way of knowing that future experiments would show that entanglement exists. In the end, John Stewart Bell showed mathematically that there is no way that hidden variables could account for experimental results that show entanglement.

[[Soakage]]

CATEGORIES: Geography of Australia, Indigenous Australian history, Water, Aquifers, Agriculture in Australia

A soakage, or soak, is a source of water in the deserts of Australia. It is called a soak because the water generally soaks into the sandy ground, and is stored below. They sometimes form part of an ephemeral river or drainage system. Soakages were traditionally important sources of water for Aboriginal people in the desert, because they are the most reliable sources in times of drought. Knowing the exact location of each soakage was very valuable knowledge. In the 19th century, the explorers Peter Warburton and David Carnegie wrote that they had chased down Aboriginal people with camels and captured and chained them to force them to reveal their secret sources of water.

[[Mantarur]]

CATEGORIES: Geography of the Northern Territory

Mantarur is a hilly area in the southwest of the Northern Territory, Australia. It forms the southeastern end of the Olia Chain of mountains. This outcrop includes Butler's Dome (Utanta; 1102 metres above sea level). The granite escarpment called Foster's Cliff is nearby to the east. Mantarur is located about 80 southwest of Kata Tjuṯa. It is on Pitjantjatjara land, part of the Petermann Aboriginal Land Trust. A family outstation was established here in the 1980s, at a rockhole in the western slopes. It has since been abandoned.

Frank Rees George led a prospecting expedition through the area between 1905 and 1906. George gave names to several of the landforms, including Butler's Dome, which is believed to have been named after Richard Butler, who was a minister of South Australia. He named Foster's Cliff after R. W. Foster, the South Australian Commissioner of Public Works. The expedition found traces of gold at Foster's Cliff, but not enough of it to warrant mining. It was the only place in the Petermann Ranges found to contain any gold.

[[Railgun]]

CATEGORIES: Firearms, Artillery

A railgun is a gun that fires metal projectiles (bullets) using a magnetic field produced by electricity. Unlike conventional guns, it does not use brass casings or gunpowder, and rarely needs to be cleaned or unjammed. Currently most railguns are experimental and are not used in war yet, but the U.S. Army is expecting to create one for war within the next few decades. In theory, a railgun could fire a bowling-ball-sized projectile fast enough to destroy a small building, even over long distances. Railguns are usually very large and not portable because of the need for a large power supply. There have been proposals to use the same technology for non-weapon purposes, such as aircraft and spacecraft launchers and specialized tools.

[[Intracranial aneurysm]]

CATEGORIES: Health problems, Stroke

Cerebral aneurysms, also called brain aneurysms, are a cerebrovascular issue in which weakness in the walls of a cerebral artery causes localized dilation or ballooning in the blood vessel. Small, unchanging aneurysms may produce very few symptoms. However, before a larger aneurysm ruptures, individuals may experience sudden or severe headaches, nausea, vomiting and vision problems. The rupture may also directly cause serious damage directly to the brain, usually from the bleeding itself-this is a hemorrhagic stroke that can lead to and may cause arm or leg weakness or paralysis and speech troubles. Cerebral aneurysms may result due to congenital defect, high blood pressure or head trauma. Onsets are sometimes sudden and without warning, and such ruptures are extremely dangerous and usually result in bleeding into the brain itself, leading to a subarachnoid hemorrhage, which then constitutes a stroke. This condition may lead to death or permanent disability for some individuals.

James Jesus Angleton (December 9, 1917 – May 12, 1987) was chief of CIA counterintelligence from 1954 to 1975. His official title was Associate Deputy Director of Operations for Counterintelligence (ADDOCI). He started towards the end of World War II, and worked in Italy for the OSS (Office of Strategic Services) after the war. Returning to Washington DC, he became one of the founding members of the CIA in 1949.

The peak of his career was in detecting "moles", that is, foreign spies in American and western secret services. The 1970s Church Committee of the US Senate established that Angleton was in charge of the domestic spying activities of the CIA under 'Operation CHAOS'.

Eventually he was fired when he accused several western prime ministers of aiding the Soviet Union, and the anti-war and civil rights movements of the 1960s and 1970s as having foreign funding.

The central building of the museum was once an 18th-century hospital. Extensive modern renovations and additions to the old building were made starting in 1980. In 1988, portions of the new museum were opened to the public, mostly in temporary configurations; that same year it was decreed by the Ministry of Culture as a national museum. Its architectural identity was radically changed in 1989 by Ian Ritchie (architect) with the addition of three glass circulation towers.  A €92 million designed by French architect Jean Nouvel opened October 2005.

The building has been functioning as the Centro del Arte (Art Center) since 1986 but was established as the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía in 1988. But analyzing the building's history up until these events, it appears that the building was subjected to being tested out as different representations of what it is today.

In some countries where money gambling in casinos is illegal the slot machines can issue free prizes, coupons or vouchers. Slot machines are the most popular gambling method in casinos and are responsible for about 70 percent of the US casino's income.

The first slot machine was invented by Charles Fey of San Francisco, California, U.S in 1894. The following year Fey built the 4-11-44 in his basement; it proved so successful at a local saloon that he soon quit his job and opened a factory to produce more units. In 1898 Fey built the Card Bell, the first three-reel slot machine with automatic cash payouts. The Card Bell had a handle that set the reels in motion when it was pushed down and playing card suitmarks that lined up to form poker hands. His next slot machine, the Liberty Bell, was built in 1899 and used horseshoes and bells as well as playing card suitmarks on the reels. Three bells lined up in a row meant the top payout. Chiefly because of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, only 4 of more than 100 Liberty Bell machines built by Fey survive. The Liberty Bell proved immensely popular among saloon patrons in San Francisco and was quickly copied by Fey’s competitors, such as the Mills Novelty Company of Chicago.

[[Diving bell]]

CATEGORIES: diving

A diving bell was an early system for underwater diving.  The basic idea of a bell is that a hollow object, even with an open bottom, will hold air when put under water (this can be seen with a glass in a sink).  If the bell is heavy enough it will sink below the water. A swimmer can be inside the bell and breathe, or hold his breath and swim outside the bell for a short time, and come back to the bell to breath again.  The idea had been around for a long time, but became useful in the 1600s. Scuba diving has mostly replaced diving bells although they are still used sometimes.

[[Uluṟu–Kata Tjuṯa Aboriginal Land Trust]]

CATEGORIES: Aboriginal Land Trusts, Northern Territory, 1985 establishments in Australia

Uluṟu–Kata Tjuṯa Aboriginal Land Trust is the land trust that holds the freehold title to the land of Uluṟu–Kata Tjuṯa National Park (referred to as Northern Territory Portion 1728). The trust is the legal landowner and holds the title on behalf of the people who are recognised as the land's traditional owners. It was created on 26 October 1985.

The land was originally claimed as part of the Katiti Land Claim in 1979. It was sumbitted by the Central Land Council on the behalf of several hundred people, most of whom lived at Muṯitjulu. The claim was judged in 1980, and Commissioner Justice John Toohey formally recognised 104 traditional owners for Uluṟu and 57 for Kata Tjuṯa. He granted them freehold title to the land now held by the Katiti Aboriginal Land Trust. They were not granted the title to Uluṟu–Kata Tjuṯa because it was already being used as a national park.

There was then a long legal case over the freehold title (actual ownership) of the park lands. The case continued until November 1983, when Prime Minister Bob Hawke acknowledged that the traditional owners had the rights to Uluṟu. In 1985, the Territory passed two amendments: one for the Aboriginal Land Rights Act and one for the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act. The freehold title to the land in the park was passed to the Uluṟu–Kata Tjuṯa Aboriginal Land Trust on 26 October 1985. As part of the agreement, the land was immediately leased back to the Director of National Parks for a period of 99 years. The title is inalienable, which means that it can not be sold, traded or given away; it is inherited continuously by the community's descendants.

[[Quantum teleportation]]

CATEGORIES: Quantum mechanics, Theoretical computer science

Quantum teleportation is a way of transferring the quantum state of one quantum system to another using the quantum entanglement between two other systems.

For example, let's assume Alice and Bob share an entangled pair of particles A and B, and Alice wants to teleport the information of another "message" particle M to Bob. 

What Alice does is interact her half of the entangled pair, A, she shares with Bob, so that now the message particle M is entangled with Alice's other particle A.

Next Alice measures both of her particles A and M and tells what the outcomes of these measurements are to Bob. Because the message particle M was entangled with Alice's other particle A, and Bob has the information of Alice's measurements, he can use this information to recreate the original message particle M out of the one he has B. 

What makes quantum teleportation special is that we didn't need to physically move the message particle M from Alice to Bob.

Paracel Islands is the name for a number of uninhabited atolls and reefs in the South China Sea. They are about 330 from Hainan and about 400 from Vietnam. Currently they are under the control of the People's Republic of China, but Taiwan and Vietnam also claim them. The islands are uninhabited. 

The islands are located in the South China Sea consisting of over 30 islets, sandbanks and reefs with about 15000 of the ocean surface. The archipelago is approximately equidistant from the coastlines of Vietnam and China, 180 southeast of Hainan Island, and about one-third of the way from central Vietnam to the northern Philippines. Turtles live on the islands, and seabirds have left nests and guano deposits, but there are no permanent human residents except military personnel and fishermen.  

The islands are divided into two main groups. The Amphitrite group is in the northeast and the Crescent group is in the southwest, and they are located about 70 from one another. Subject to hot and humid climate, with abundant rainfall and frequent typhoons, the archipelago is surrounded by productive fishing grounds and potential oil and gas reserves.

The Beach Erosion Board (BEB) was a federal board organized under the US Government's War Department (later, the Department of Defense), U.S. Army, and was a part of the civil works program of the United States Army Corps of Engineers.  The Board had seven members and a staff.  The life of the BEB spanned a period of 33 years, beginning with its establishment in July 1930. The BEB was abolished in November of 1963.

The functions of the BEB pertained to review of reports of investigations made concerning erosion of the shores of coastal and lake waters, and the protection of those shores.  Under its implementing legislation, Section 2 of Public Law 520, 7lst Congress, approved on July 3, 1930, the Chief of Engineers, U.S. Army, was given authority to make, in cooperation with the appropriate agencies of the various coastal States, investigations and studies aimed at devising effective means of presenting erosion of the shores of coastal and lake waters by waves and currents.   The funding provision for these investigations and studies was that no money should be expended under authority of the Act in any State which did not provide for cooperation with the agecies of the United States and contribute to the project such funds and/or services as the Secretary of War deemed appropriate and required.

In 1963, certain of the BEB’s functions were transferred to the newly created Coastal Engineering Research Center, while others were transferred to the Board of Engineers for Rivers and Harbors.  Pursuant to the federal Water Resources Development Act of 1992, the duties and responsibilities of the Board of Engineers for Rivers and Harbors subsequently were transferred by the Secretary of the Army to other elements within the Department of the Army as the Secretary determined to be necessary.

[[Rufous hare-wallaby]]

CATEGORIES: Macropods, Marsupials of Australia

The rufous hare-wallaby (Lagorchestes hirsutus) is a small wallaby found in Australia. It is also known by its Western Desert name mala. It used to be found widely across the western half of Australia, but is now only found in Bernier and Dorre Islands in Shark Bay. It is currently classified as a vulnerable species.

The rufous hare-wallaby is a nocturnal herbivore that eats herbs, leaves and seeds. It is usually solitary, meaning that it lives alone. The species was first described by John Gould in The Mammals of Australia (1844). It is currently being reintroduced to mainland Australia, to the Tanami Desert in the Northern Territory. Four distinct groups of this species have been described as subspecies:

The mala is a common totem in Western Desert Aboriginal Dreamings.

[[Hasty generalization]]

CATEGORIES: Logical fallacies

Hasty generalization is an informal fallacy of generalisation by making decisions based on too little evidence or without recognizing all of the variables. In statistics, it may mean basing broad conclusions of a survey from a small sample group.

A hasty generalization made from a single example is sometimes called the "fallacy of the lonely fact" or the "proof by example fallacy".

When evidence is intentionally excluded to bias the result, it is sometimes termed the "fallacy of exclusion".

[[Kelly Hills]]

CATEGORIES: Mountain ranges of Australia, Mountains of the Northern Territory

The Kelly Hills (Aputjilpi) are a mountain range at the southern end of the Northern Territory of Australia. It is located directly north of the Musgrave Ranges, and about 50 northeast of Amaṯa. Its highest point is about 870 above sea level. Mount Robert, at the eastern end of the range, is about 796 metres above sea level. The area is known as Aputjilpinya in the native Yankunytjatjara language. It forms part of an important Mala Dreaming track that runs between Uluṟu and Ulkiya.

There are a few soakages located within the hills. One of them, Puntitjara, was recorded by several early White explorers travelling through the Kelly Hills. The South Australian government's North-West Prospecting Expedition, led by Lawrence Wells, was brought there by an Aboriginal guide in 1903. One of the expedition's prospectors, Herbert Basedow, recorded the name as "Punndijarrinna" and reported that it was a good source of water. Basedow returned to Puntitjara in June 1926 on another expedition, this one led by Donald Mackay. According to Mackay, they found it dry and covered with a layer of sand. The anthropologist Ted Strehlow visited Puntitjara in August 1936, but founded it covered by mud.

James Edward Kelly (born February 14, 1960) is a former American football quarterback in the NFL for the Buffalo Bills and in the USFL for the Houston Gamblers. He played college football for the Miami Hurricanes. While Kelly was drafted by the Bills in 1983, he did not want to play for them at first, instead joining the Gamblers in the USFL. He was a star player for Houston until the USFL went out of business in 1986, after which he finally joined the Bills. 

Kelly continued playing at a high level, helping the Bills become one of the NFL's best teams for some time. From 1990 to 1993, the Bills appeared in four straight Super Bowls with Kelly at quarterback. Though the Bills failed to win every time, they remain the only team in NFL history to make it to four or more Super Bowls as of 2019. Long after retiring in 1997, Kelly is still considered the greatest quarterback in Buffalo Bills team history by many people, as he still holds many passing records for the team.

[[Texas City disaster]]

CATEGORIES: 1947 in the United States, Disasters in the 1940s, 20th century in Texas, Transport disasters in the United States, April events

The Texas City Disaster of 1947 was a major and very deadly incident. It happened on Wednesday, April 16, 1947, and was one of the largest non-nuclear explosions to hit the United States. The incident began as a late morning fire on the French vessel SS Grandcamp which had been docked next to Texas City and nearby Galveston. But then, its almost twenty three hundred ton cargo of ammonium nitrate detonated,  creating several massive explosions that caused serious damage. The incident killed 581 people.

The Grandcamp, a World War II Liberty ship that had been converted to a French merchant vessel, was taking on a load of ammonium nitrate fertilizer at a quay next to a complex of Monsanto chemical factories, offices and labs. The ship's carpenter smelled smoke in the No. 4 hold around 8 a.m. on April 16 and found that a few bags of fertilizer were on fire. He tried dousing it with a few buckets of water, then a fire extinguisher.

When he called for a hose, the ship's captain forbade it, fearful that water would destroy the $500 worth of cargo that was on fire. The skipper ordered the hold closed and its fire-suppression valves opened to release steam. Ordinarily a good idea, but not in this case.

Ammonium nitrate decomposes at around 350 degrees Fahrenheit. The fire grew. The captain ordered his crew to abandon ship.Firefighters tried spraying the burning ship from the dock. Spectators, including schoolchildren crowded the quayside to watch the action. Bad idea, since the Grandcamp exploded at 9:12 a.m. The captain and 32 of the Grandcamp's crew died; 10 somehow survived. More than 200 people were killed on the quay. The blast was heard 160 miles away. It shattered all the windows in Texas City and half of those in Galveston, 10 miles away.

Some debris reached an altitude of nearly 3 miles before falling back to earth. Two airplanes circling overhead were blown apart by the heavy shrapnel. A one-ton piece of the ship's propeller shaft landed 2½ miles away. Other pieces sailed 5 miles.The blast flattened 20 waterfront blocks and 12 blocks inland. Flaming debris ignited oil, gas and chemical tanks at the sprawling Monsanto complex and three nearby oil companies.

People died everywhere, blown up by the blast, decapitated by flying metal, sliced by falling glass, burned by flaming metal and chemicals, crushed by falling buildings. The litany of death was long and varied. Thousands more suffered injuries.

Fire and rescue workers rushed in from nearby cities, and the Red Cross mobilized a massive national response, but these were the days before jet passenger and cargo planes. Local authorities set up temporary morgues and pressed medical students into duty in overwhelmed emergency rooms.

The cargo ship Highflyer, which had been moored near the Grandcamp, caught fire the morning after the explosion. When the fire seemed to be getting out of control, tugs were called to tow the ship out of the port, lest its own cargo of fertilizer explode, too. Unfortunately, the force of the Grandcamp explosion had locked the Highflyer into a deadly embrace with another ship, the Wilson B. Keene, and the Highflyer wouldn't budge. The tugs gave up. The Highflyer blew up, also demolishing the Keene, and raining death and fire anew on Texas City. The shockwave and new fires killed hundreds more.

The fires were not put out until April 18. Bodies and parts of bodies were strewn all over town. The state government ultimately listed 405 identified and 63 unidentified dead. Another 100 or perhaps 200 were counted as missing. Injuries may have reached 3,500. That's 4,000 casualties in a town of 16,000.

More than 1,500 houses – a third of the town's housing – were destroyed. Two thousand of the survivors were rendered homeless. Property damage reached at least $600 million (almost $6 billion in today's money).

An official report on the disaster recommended improved containers, labeling and special handling of ammonium nitrate fertilizer; prohibiting smoking in all piers and docks at all times; and worst-case-scenario community disaster plans to coordinate relief agencies, police and fire departments, hospitals, doctors and nurses, civil officials and military authorities.

Today, the unknown dead rest in a special cemetery. Monuments in Texas City include the propeller of the Highflyer and an anchor from the Grandcamp.

[[Dead reckoning]]

CATEGORIES: Navigation

Dead Reckoning (or DR) is a method of estimating a position. It is an important part of navigation. It uses the last known point (a fix), and speed and direction the vehicle or person has moved since it was at the fix, to make a good guess where the current position is. 

It is used to track where a ship or airplane or sometimes where a vehicle on land is at.  Now, Global Positioning System (GPS) is used and dead reckoning is not as important.  But it is still used in areas where GPS is not available or for short periods of time if a GPS update is missed.  It is also good to know in case the GPS satellites are damaged by a solar flare, or equipment is lost or broken, so it is still taught to sailors and pilots.

Dead Reckoning is how the sailors mapped the world after Christopher Columbus came to the New World. Using the stars, they could find their latitude (distance between the equator and the poles). But before accurate clocks were created, they could not tell their longitude (how far east or west they were) unless they saw land that they knew.  So to cross the oceans they used dead reckoning.  This is also how Richard Byrd became the first person to fly to the North Pole in 1926. He was able to fly for 16 hours and come back to the place he had left, with only ice fields beneath him.

[[Iltur, South Australia]]

CATEGORIES: Indigenous Australian communities, Settlements in South Australia, Pitjantjatjara

Iltur is the name of a remote Pitjantjatjara homeland in the Great Victoria Desert of South Australia. It is also known as Ilturnga or Coffin Hill after the rocky outcrop where it is located. It is located at the southern end of the Birksgate Range, and is one of the most southerly locations on the Aṉangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Lands. It was visited by the Elder Scientific Exploring Expedition in 1981, led by the explorer David Lindsay.

Many of the families who had lived in this region historically were forced to leave the area due to nuclear weapons tests at Maralinga. They were moved to Fregon in the north and to Yalata, very far to the south. Not all of them left, however, and some still living around Iltur reported that they were affected by the fallout of the tests. In 1976, the Department of Aboriginal Affairs offered AU$10,000 for the establishment of an outstation community at Iltur. An outstation was built, but is not always occupied.

[[Honeypot ant]]

CATEGORIES: Ants, Indigenous Australian culture

Honeypot ants, or repletes, are sterile worker ants which are used as food stores. They develop swelled abdomens,  filled with food by other worker ants. They are living storage containers. There are five genera of honepot ants. 

Ant species often have polymorphs: different forms of the same type. The soldier ants which defend colonies are genetically the same as the normal workers. The way they develop is different. This is done by changes in food, or by pheromones. 

Young honeypot ants are more or less force-fed until their gasters (=stomachs) are swelled up. Then they act as living food storage vessels. These food storage workers are called repletes. 

These replete workers develop in the North American honeypot ant Myrmecocystus mexicanus. Rissing found that usually the largest workers in the colony develop into repletes; and, if repletes are removed from the colony, other workers become repletes. This shows the flexibility of this polymorphism.

Honey ants use their own bodies as living storage, but they have more function than just storing food. Some store liquids, body fat, and water brought to them by worker ants. They can later serve as a food source for their fellow ants when food is otherwise scarce. When the liquid stored inside a honeypot ant is needed, the worker ants stroke the antennae of the honeypot ant, causing the honeypot ant to regurgitate the stored liquid.

In certain places, such as the Australian outback, honeypot ants are eaten by people as sweets and are considered a delicacy.

[[Hogna]]

CATEGORIES: Lycosidae

Spiders of the genus Hogna are large and powerful wolf spiders. They belong to the Family called Lycosidae. They will readily catch and eat crickets and other large insects. They do not try to hurt humans unless they are getting hurt themselves. Usually their colors are dull, mostly they are brown, dark brown, or black. 

Hogna carolinensis is the largest spider in the United States and can have a body length (head to tail) of up to almost 1.5 inches or 35mm. They scare people, but it is hard to get them even to try to bite. Instead of showing their fangs, they will run away. They can run very fast. They are about 16 times larger than the smallest species of wolf spiders. For instance, the smallest of the wolf spiders of the genus Trabeops are only 4 mm. long. 

Hogna carolinensis often digs burrows to live in. 

Other species in this genus include:

In Europe there is a slightly smaller spider called Lycosa tarantula, a kind of wolf spider that people once believed could kill people. It gets its name from the city of Taranto in Italy. There are other wolf spiders that get a little larger than Hogna carolinensis, one of which is found in the Canary Islands, Allohogna singoriensis, which reaches a full 40mm.

[[Great Expectations]]

CATEGORIES: 1861 books, Books by Charles Dickens, English-language novels, English novels, London in fiction

Great Expectations is a novel by Charles Dickens. It depicts the growth and personal development of an orphan named Philip Pirrip ("Pip"). The novel was first published in serial form in Dickens' weekly periodical All the Year Round, from 1 December 1860 to August 1861. In October 1861, Chapman and Hall published the novel in three volumes.

It is set among the marshes of Kent and in London in the early to mid 19th century. From the outset, the reader is "treated" by the terrifying encounter between Pip, the protagonist, and the escaped convict, Abel Magwitch. Great Expectations is a graphic book, full of extreme imagery, poverty, prison ships, "the hulks," barriers and chains, and fights to the death. It therefore combines intrigue and unexpected twists of autobiographical detail in different tones. Regardless of its narrative technique, the novel reflects the events of the time, Dickens' concerns, and the relationship between society and man.

Dickens felt Great Expectations was his best work, calling it "a very fine idea," and was very sensitive to compliments from his friends: "Bulwer, who has been, as I think you know, extraordinarily taken by the book." The cast includes the capricious Miss Havisham, the cold and beautiful Estella, the kind and generous blacksmith Joe, the dry and sycophantic Uncle Pumblechook, and the eloquent and wise  Herbert Pocket. Throughout the narrative, typical Dickensian themes emerge: wealth and poverty, love and rejection, and the eventual triumph of good over evil.

Great Expectations has been translated into many languages and adapted many times to movies and other media.

[[Kaḻayapiṯi]]

CATEGORIES: Geography of South Australia, Waterholes of Australia

Kaḻayapiṯi (also written Kaḻaya Piṯi and Kaḻaiapiṯi) is a rock hole in the Birksgate Range in northwestern South Australia. It is an important location in the early history of the Pitjantjatjara people. The name comes from the words kaḻaya (emu) and piṯi (referring to a place from which the ancestral being is believed to originate; kapi piṯi is a waterhole). It is a major sacred site for the Kaḻaya Tjukurpa (Emu Dreaming), and has been used for ceremonies by the Pitjantjatjara since long before colonisation of Australia.

Kaḻayapiṯi forms the southern heartland of the traditional Pitjantjatjara territory. According to the anthropologist Norman Tindale, the Pitjantjatjara people originally migrated from the southern coast. Kaḻayapiṯi served as their main home as they moved further north and northeast into the Tomkinson, Mann and Petermann Ranges. The rock hole here was very important during droughts, as there were few sources of water so reliable and permanent in the Great Victoria Desert to the south. However, during a long and severe drought between 1914 and 1916, the Pitjantjatjara were forced to move further east into the Musgrave Ranges, traditionally Yankunytjatjara territory.

[[Tjayanka Woods]]

CATEGORIES: 1935 births, Living people, Australian painters, Weavers, Indigenous Australian artists, Pitjantjatjara, Artists from Western Australia, Artists from South Australia

Tjayanka Woods is an Australian Aboriginal artist. She was one of the pioneers of the art movement across the Ngaanyatjarra, Pitjantjatjara and Yankunytjatjara lands, which began in 2000. She is best known for her paintings, but also a craftswoman who makes baskets and other woven artworks. Her paintings are held in the Art Gallery of Western Australia, National Gallery of Victoria, and the National Gallery of Australia.

Woods was born about 1935. She was born close to Kaḻayapiṯi, a rock hole in the Great Victoria Desert of South Australia. She grew up living a traditional, nomadic way of life in the bush with her family, before any contact with Euro-Australian society. They often camped at Kaḻayapiṯi, where Woods and the other girls would gather bushfood together. She learned to carve basic tools and decorative objects, and to burn traditional patterns into the wood (this is called puṉu). She also learned to spin hair string on a hand-spun spindle and weave head rings and ceremonial belts from hair and feathers.

Woods began painting in 2000, after moving to Irrunytju. The women there opened an art centre as an community-owned economic project, called Irrunytju Arts. From the beginning of her career, Brown often painted with her friend Anmanari Brown. When Brown's husband died in 2007, the two women left Irrunytju and went to live at Papulankutja, on Ngaanyatjarra lands. Here, they paint for Papulankutja Artists. In April 2010, the two women held their first solo exhibition together at the Vivien Anderson Gallery in Melbourne. Woods has had two of her paintings chosen as finalists for the National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award, in 2006 and 2008.

Woods' paintings are mostly about the Minyma Kutjara Tjukurpa (Two Sisters Dreaming), which is her personal Dreaming. They are structured like maps drawn in the sand, tracing the journey of the two sisters around the edge of the canvas. She paints in earthy colours, and uses solid and dotted lines in concentric circles to depict the journeys and activities of figures in the story.

[[The Tinderbox]]

CATEGORIES: Fairy tales, Works by Hans Christian Andersen

"The Tinderbox" is a literary fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen.  It was originally published in Copenhagen, Denmark in May 1835 in the first booklet of Fairy Tales Told for Children. The three other stories in the booklet were "Big Claus and Little Claus", "The Princess and the Pea", and "Little Ida's Flowers". The critics did not like these stories. They thought the stories  immoral. "The Tinderbox" is Andersen's retelling of "The Spirit in the Candle", a traditional Danish story he knew as a child. It is also similar to "Aladdin and the Magic Lamp", another Andersen childhood favorite. The tale has been adapted to various media including the first Danish animated movie.

== Story == 

A soldier steals a magic tinderbox from an old witch. The tinderbox can summon three magic dogs that will do what the soldier wants them to do. He orders one dog to bring him a sleeping princess from her parents' castle. When the king and queen learn where their daughter is, the soldier is arrested and sentenced to death. At the last moment, he summons the dogs. They save his life and he marries the princess.

[[The Princess and the Pea]]

CATEGORIES: Fairy tales, Works by Hans Christian Andersen

"The Princess and the Pea" is a literary fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen.  It was first published in Copenhagen, Denmark in 1835. It appeared as the third tale in the first book of Andersen's Fairy Tales Told for Children. The other tales in the little book were "The Tinderbox", "Big Claus and Little Claus", and "Little Ida's Flowers". 

The story tells of a maiden whose royalty is established by her sensitivity to a pea placed under her matresses. Stories of super-sensitivity are rare. They are not unknown however in world literature and lore. Andersen heard the tale of the pea as a child, but it is unknown in Danish folk tradition. He probably heard a Swedish version of the tale.

The critics did not like these four stories. They did not like their informal, chatty style. They thought the stories immoral. The stories did not promote good behaviour and the mores of the times. "Little Claus and Big Claus", for instance, featured unpunished lying, hoodwinking, theft, and adulterous conduct. 

The story has been adapted to various media including a television program on Shelley Duval's Fairy Tale Theatre. A popular musical play of the 1960s was based on the story  called Once Upon a Mattress. It starred comedienne Carol Burnett.

[[The Steadfast Tin Soldier]]

CATEGORIES: Fairy tales, Works by Hans Christian Andersen

"The Steadfast Tin Soldier" is a literary fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen. The story was first published in Copenhagen, Denmark by C.A. Reitzel on 2 October 1838 in the first booklet of Fairy Tales Told for Children. The booklet includes Andersen's "The Daisy" and "The Wild Swans". The story was Andersen’s first story not based upon a folk tale or a literary model.  "The Steadfast Tin Soldier" has been adapted to various media including ballet and animated movie. 

The story tells of a tin soldier who loves a paper ballerina. He falls from the window in the toy room. After many adventures, he is returned to the toy room. A little boy throws the tin soldier in the fire. A breeze blows the paper ballerina into the fire. The two toys are destroyed together.

Joan G. Haahr writes in The Oxford Companion to Fairy Tales: "The story is unusual among Andersen's early tales, both in its emphasis on sensual desire and in its ambiguities. Blind fate, not intention, determines all events. Moreover, the narrative questions the very decorum it praises. The tin soldier's passive acceptance of whatever happens to him, while exemplifying pietistic ideals of self-denial, also contributes to his doom. Were he to speak and act, the soldier might gain both life and love. Restrained, however, by inhibition and convention, he finds only tragedy and death. The tale is often read autobiographically, with the soldier viewed as symbolizing Andersen's feelings of inadequacy with women, his passive acceptance of bourgeois class attitudes, or his sense of alienation as an artist and an outsider, from full participation in everyday life."

[[Abdominal compartment syndrome]]

CATEGORIES: Syndromes

Abdominal compartment syndrome occurs when the abdominal cavity (compartment) within the body becomes subject to increased pressure from within. This may be caused by internal bleeding, a blockage or fluid build-up in the intestines, or 'ascites' which is when fluid accumulates in the peritoneal cavity - the space between the lining of the abdomen (peritoneum) and the abdominal organs (the stomach, small and large intestines, pancreas, liver, and gallbladder).

This increased pressure causes the abdomen to distend or expand, stretching the skin and placing pressure on the abdominal organs, which can constrict the blood vessels which supply them. When the pressure reaches a level above that of the blood supply to the tissues and organs of the abdomen, ischemia will happen leading to organ dysfunction and eventually failure.

An operation called a decompressive laparotomy may need to be performed, where an incision is made to open the abdominal cavity. The incision is typically left open for a period of time to reduce the  pressure in the abdomen.

Abdominal compartment syndrome can be divided into three categories:

[[Bogotá bag]]

CATEGORIES: Surgery, Medical equipment

A Bogotá bag is a sterile plastic bag used to temporarily close incisions in the abdomen.  It is generally a sterilized, 3 liter urological irrigation fluid bag, that is sewn to the skin or fascia of the anterior abdominal wall. It is called a 'Bogotá bag' because it was first used by Oswaldo Borraez, a doctor in Bogotá, Colombia.

Temporary abdominal closure techniques are used to postpone definite closure until predisposing factors causing pathologic elevation of intra abdominal pressure are resolved. These techniques include the Bogota bag, absorbable mesh, vacuum pack dressings, the Wittmann patch or velcro burr and the KCI VAC or Abthera dressings.

Temporary abdominal closure techniques are most commonly used in cases of abdominal compartment syndrome in which decompressive laparotomy is necessary to reduce intra abdominal pressure to restore system perfusion. 

The Bogota bag acts as a hermetic barrier that avoids evisceration and loss of fluids. Another advantage to the Bogota bag, is that the abdominal contents can be visually inspected. 

The bogota bag can be used in cases of 'burst abdomen' following laparotomies, especially those using a midline horizontal incision. Burst abdomen is usually characterized by a serosanguinous pink discharge from the wound, 6–8 days after surgery

[[Locating (physics)]]

CATEGORIES: physics

The act of locating something, of finding or defining the location of something, is a basic idea of modern science. In physics to say what "to locate" or "location" means, we must explain with clear talk how we do the job of locating something.

For things about our size, we generally use two beginning points that everybody knows about, and then we measure from those points to the thing we want to give a location. We might start with the Plymouth Rock and the Blarney Stone. We could then say, "Captain Smith's ship is 1400 miles from Plymouth Rock going toward the Blarney Stone." Or, in another case we might say, "Captain Jones's ship can be found by drawing a line from Plymouth Rock to the Blarney Stone, finding a point 700 miles along this line from Plymouth Rock, taking a left turn of 90° upon reaching this point from Plymouth Rock, and then traveling an additional 90 miles.  

If we have some good way of knowing compass directions, we can say something like, "Go three miles north of that big white rock over there and then go two miles east from that point. That is where I put the gold."

Finding the location of something is ordinarily done by seeing it somewhere, hearing it somewhere, feeling it somewhere, etc. Sometimes we know where something is by looking at a photograph, finding it with radar, or pinging it with sonar.

It is much more difficult to locate an electron, a photon, or anything else about that small. We may construct a light source that only makes one photon at a time. We can aim the light source at a piece of photographic film, let the light source make one photon, and then develop the photographic film. If we had very sensitive photographic film that could be darkened by only one photon, then we would find a tiny speck of silver where the photon ended up. A silver atom is much larger than a photon, so there would be some fuzziness about where the photon ended up, but people probably would agree that the photon must have ended up somewhere within the target formed by the silver atom. However, all we can say is that the photon must have been at that point when it ended its existence. When a photon is absorbed by an electron it gives its energy to the electron and disappears. So when it was briefly at some definite place it immediately lost all of its motion. 

Another way to locate a photon is to make it go through a small place. Knowing when the light source sends out a photon, and knowing the speed of light, we can know when it must be going through a hole in a plate put in the center of its path to the film. We can gradually get closer and closer to finding out exactly where it is in the middle of its flight. However, the path that it will take from there on becomes progressively wild. That is because when a photon goes through a hole like that it experiences diffraction.

It was released in North America on March 20, 2006, in Europe on May 5, 2006, and in Japan on June 1, 2006. When the Nintendo DS launched in 2004, it included an early demo of Metroid Prime Hunters, which at that point was titled Metroid Prime Hunters: First Hunt.

Like the other titles in the Metroid Prime series, Metroid Prime Hunters is a first-person adventure game where the focus is on exploration and discovery. However, it differs from other titles in that there is no assisted aiming, a bigger focus on gameplay, and online multiplayer. Samus Aran, the main character that the player plays as, can access her gunship from anywhere. The game uses both screens of the Nintendo DS: the top screen is used to show Samus' health and the amount of a weapon remaining, while the bottom screen shows the radar. The player moves Samus with the D-pad, and aiming is done with the use of the touch screen on the Nintendo DS' bottom screen.

Online multiplayer can be played with up to four players. Players can play as Samus or one of six bounty hunters. Each bounty hunter has different forms and weapons. The game's host is able to set options for points and time limits, as well as determine whether or not players can use the radar. If less than four players join a game, computer-controlled characters are placed into the game. In multiplayer, the bottom screen shows the number of kills a player has made and the time remaining in the round.

Anne Hutchinson (baptized July 20, 1591 - August or September 1643), was a religious dissenter in Puritan New England. Her parents are Francis Marbury and Bridget Dryden. Her father, being a clergy, homeschooled Anne Hutchinson. She got more education than most other girls at that time. She was the defendant in the most famous of the trials intended to suppress religious dissent in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. She was born Anne Marbury in Alford, Lincolnshire, England. She, her husband William, and their children left England for the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1634. Once settled, she began holding weekly meetings in her home to discuss sermons and theology. 

Her religious views did not agree with those of her Puritan neighbors. They believed good works were necessary for salvation. Hutchinson believed that only faith (Sola fide) was necessary. She also believed that God revealed himself to people without the help of the clergy. Community leaders viewed Hutchinson as a threat. She was found guilty of heresy in 1637, and told to leave the colony.

Hutchinson and her family moved first to Rhode Island. After her husband's death in 1642, she settled near present-day Pelham Bay on Long Island Sound. In 1643, Hutchinson, all her children except one, and all her servants were killed in an attack perpetrated by Native Americans.

[[Mars in fiction]]

CATEGORIES: Mars, Science fiction, Fantasy

Novels and short stories about Mars have been popular for over a hundred years. The planet's dramatic red color that some people can see is one reason for this.  another is that the planet  is close to Earth.  Also, it looks somewhat like Earth.  There are also stories about creatures from Mars on Earth and elsewhere.

Near the end of the 19th century, the astronomer 

Giovanni Schiaparelli reported seeing what  he thought might be water channels on Mars. Because the Italian for channels is canali, English translations tended to render the word as "canals", implying artificial construction. This led to the idea of intelligent beings on Mars before it apparently dried up.

The following works of fiction deal with the planet itself, with any assumed Martian civilization as part of its planetary landscape.

After Biel City bought the system in 1901, it became electrical with more carriages and a bigger route. The tram was not very popular and the owner did not earn much money. This was the reason why only very few routes were built.

All the four routes started at the train station in Biel, today known as ‘Zentralplatz’. The tram to Meinisberg went through Mett but because there was a big distance between Biel and Meinisberg, there were only a few stations.

Biel City started to reduced the system in 1930. First, route 1 and 2 became route 1. Then, in 1940, routes 2 and 3 were replaced by buses and finally, route 1 became a bus route, too.

CATEGORIES: Chemical compounds

Organolithium compounds contain a direct bond between a carbon atom and a lithium atom. They are an important class of organometallic compound. The bonding between the carbon and lithium is highly polar due to the difference in electronegativity between these atoms, which effectively makes the carbon negatively charged and capable of acting as a strong base or nucleophile. These compounds are similar to Grignard reagents, but are much more reactive. Organolithium reagents such as butyllithium are widely commercially available. Due to their highly reactive nature, they must be handled under a protective atmosphere such as nitrogen or argon as they will catch fire in air.

Although Japan says the Ryukyuan languages are dialects of Japanese, most linguists see them as languages. This is because Japanese speakers would not be able to understand Ryukyuan without learning it.

In the past, the Ryukyuan languages were spoken all over Ryukyu but due to the languages being discriminated against, most Ryukyuans now speak Japanese.

[[Dutch Golden Age painting]]

CATEGORIES: Dutch paintings

There was a period in the 17th century, where Dutch trade, science and art were among the most advanced in Europe. The period is known as the Dutch Golden Age. In general, this period started in the second half of the Eighty Years' War. After the war, there was the Dutch Republic which was the most propsperous nation in Europe. The historical period of the time was called Baroque. Many of the paintings of this period show the scenes more pretty than they really were. This is called 'idealisation'. The Dutch paintings of the time often lack this feature. Artists of the movement include Peter Paul Rubens, Johannes Vermeer, Bartholomeus van der Helst, and Jacob van Loo.

There were relatively few paintings with religious themes during this period. The reason for this was that most Dutch were Calvinist. Calvinism forbade religious painting in churches. Even though such subjects were acceptable in private homes, they were not very popular. The other traditional classes of history and portrait painting were present, but the period is more notable for a huge variety of other genres, sub-divided into numerous specialized categories, such as scenes of peasant life, landscapes, townscapes, landscapes with animals, maritime paintings, flower paintings and still lifes of various types. The development of many of these types of painting was decisively influenced by 17th-century Dutch artists.  

There was a theory in painting, that some types of painting were  more prestigious than others. This theory is known as hierarchy of genres. Because history painting was at the top of the list, many painters wanted to produce historical paintings. The problem with this was that historical paintings were the most difficult to sell. To be able to live from their painting, many painters were forced to produce portraits or genre scenes, which sold much more easily. The hierarchy was as follows:

The Dutch concentrated heavily on the "lower" categories, but by no means rejected the concept of the hierarchy. Most paintings were relatively small – the only common type of really large paintings were group portraits. Painting directly onto walls hardly existed; when a wall-space in a public building needed decorating fitted framed canvas was normally used. For the extra precision possible on a hard surface many painters continued to use wooden panels, some time after the rest of Western Europe had abandoned them; some used copper plates, usually recycling plates from printmaking. In turn the number of surviving Golden Age paintings was reduced by them being overpainted with new works by artists throughout the 18th and 19th century – poor ones were usually cheaper than a new canvas, stretcher and frame. There was very little Dutch sculpture during the period; it is mostly found in tomb monuments and attached to public buildings, and small sculptures for houses are a noticeable gap, their place taken by silverware and ceramics. Painted delftware tiles were very cheap and common, if rarely of really high quality, but silver, especially in the auricular style, led Europe. With this exception, the best artistic efforts were concentrated on painting and printmaking.

[[Starving Time]]

CATEGORIES: History of Virginia, Cannibalism, 1609, 1610

The Starving Time at Jamestown in Virginia Colony was a period of starvation during the winter of 1609–1610. During this time, all but 60 of the 500 colonists died. Lack of rain and access to water had crippled the agricultural production during the summer. Also, the water that the colonists drank was brackish and only drinkable half the year.  

According to historical accounts, the colonists ate dogs, snakes, cats, rats, horses, books and shoe leather through the winter. There is forensic evidence of at least one instance of cannibalism. The remains of a teenage girl (c. 1595–1609), named "Jane" by researchers, showed signs of being butchered (cut up for eating). Examination of Jane's shin bone indicates she was probably 14 years old at the time of her death. Based on studies of the isotopes in a tooth, she was probably from southern England. She was possibly the daughter of a gentleman or a maid in a gentleman's home because she had consumed generous amounts of protein (meat). Jane likely arrived in Virginia in August 1609. 

It is almost certain Jane was removed from her grave before being butchered and eaten. She was not murdered. In 1625, George Percy, president of Jamestown during the starvation period, wrote that the hunger was so intense “thatt notheinge was Spared to mainteyne Lyfe and to doe those things which seame incredible, as to digge upp deade corpes outt of graves and to eate them." Five other accounts refer to cannibalism during the bitter winter.

Only 10 percent of Jane's remains have been recovered by researchers. The remains were found about 2.5 feet (0.8 m) down in a trash pit in the cellar of a building built in 1608 inside the James Fort site. Historical accounts indicate cannibalism was widespread at Jamestown during the winter. Modern historians were reluctant to credit these accounts without other evidence. Jane however is the first forensic evidence that confirms the existence of the practice during that winter.

Armin Meiwes (born 1 December 1961) is a German man who is known for an act of cannibalism. 

In March 2001, Meiwes, a then 41-year-old bisexual computer technician, placed an advertisement online for a well-built male he could kill and eat. Forty-three year old Bernd-Jurgen Brandes answered the ad later that month. Meiwes took Brandes to his home in Rotenberg. Brandes had sex with Meiwes, then asked Meiwes to cut off his penis. Meiwes did so, then fried the penis. The two ate it. Meiwes then killed Brandes with Brandes's consent by stabbing him repeatedly in the neck. He cut the body in pieces and froze the pieces for later consumption. Meiwes was arrested in December 2002. He had consumed about 20 kg of Brandes' body. Cannibalism was not illegal in Germany in 2001 when Meiwes killed and ate Brandes. Meiwes was convicted of killing by request and defiling a corpse. He received a sentence of 8.5 years. The Meiwes case was the first cannibalism case in Germany.

In May 2006, a court sentenced Meiwes to life in prison after a retrial.

[[Shifting cultivation]]

CATEGORIES: Agriculture

Shifting cultivation is an agricultural system in which areas of land are cultivated for a short time.Shifting cultivation is practised in the thickly forested areas of Amazon basin,tropical Africa,parts of southeast Asia and northeast India. These are areas of heavy rainfall and quick regenerating of vegetation. Then they are left to grow back their natural vegetation, while the farmer moves to another area. It is practised in forested areas of the Amazon basin.It is one of the rudimentary forms of cultivation.

After cultivation a plot of land is cleared by felling the trees and burning them.The ashes are then mixed with the soil and crops like maize,yam,potatoes and cassava are grown. After the soil looses its fertility, the land is abandoned and the cultivator moves to a new plot.

Because the soil is no longer protected from the large trees in the rainforest system, it can be ruined easily by thick rain and too much sun.

One of the main problems with shifting cultivation is that the land is ruined after being used 3 to 4 times, which means that the areas of land are abandoned and not prepared to grow again- and the rainforest becomes smaller with each preparation for a new piece of land. 

Shifting cultivation is also known as slash and burn agriculture.

They also take a part of the energy from the production or the absorption of creatine.

[[LEED]]

CATEGORIES: Ecology, Sustainable development

Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) is a certification program for the design,  construction and operation of high performance green buildings since 2002. This mark of excellence is known across the world and there are four levels of excellence. There are 100 possible base points distributed across five major credit categories: Sustainable Sites, Water Efficiency, Energy and Atmosphere, Materials and Resources, Indoor Environmental Quality, plus an additional six points for Innovation in Design and an additional four points for Regional Priority. Buildings can qualify for four levels of certification.

LEED is not a standard but an evaluation grid.  LEED is a way to think up and realise art projects in a durable way. LEED only applies to buildings and not to products.  It is not a prize but a certification that is delivered by the CaGBC (Canada Green Building Consil). They are the ones who will make sure that all the points are well applied and respected.

So, LEED is a grid that helps us obtain a maximum gain of money, health conditions and restrictions on earth pollution.  If there is a house to build in Canada, we must do the excavation and that earth is usually brought to a landfill.  But, if you want to stay within LEED standards, that earth must be left on the site. Also, if you have to demolish a building, you must use and demonstrate that you recycled all materials in the construction. Also, that you used the maximum quantity of material possible from the old building to the one being built.

[[Singapore strategy]]

CATEGORIES: British Empire, 20th century in Singapore

The Singapore strategy was a strategy about defending the British Empire in the Asian Far East, mainly against the Empire of Japan. The strategy involved a number of different plans and stages, developed between 1919 and 1941. The basic idea was to base a fleet of ships in the Far East. This fleet could then be used to stop and defeat a Japanese force heading towards India or Australia. In 1919, Singapore was chosen because of its strategic location at the end of the Strait of Malacca.

The planners thought that a war with Japan would have three phases: while the garrison of Singapore defended the fortress, the fleet would make its way to Singapore, so that it could relieve or recapture Hong Kong. The fleet could also  impose a blockade on the Japanese home islands, which would force the Japanese to accept terms. The planners did not think it was practical to invade Japan. The planners also thought that the Japanese would fight a naval battle. Japan consists of many islands. The planners therefore thought that economic pressure would be enough.

The Singapore strategy was the cornerstone of British Imperial defence policy in the Far East during the 1920s and 1930s. By 1937, according to Captain Stephen Roskill, "the concept of the 'Main Fleet to Singapore' had, perhaps through constant repetition, assumed something of the inviolability of Holy Writ".  With the time, many problems became apparent. One of the problems was that implementing the strategy cost a lot of money. Other difficulties were of a  political or  practical nature. Because of all these problems, the strategy could not be implemented. During the 1930s, the strategy was constantly criticised in Britain and abroad. Australia used the strategy to spend as little money as possible on the defence of the country.  The strategy ultimately led to the despatch of Force Z to Singapore and the sinking of the Prince of Wales and Repulse by Japanese air attack on 10 December 1941. The subsequent ignominious fall of Singapore was described by Winston Churchill as "the worst disaster and largest capitulation in British history". The Japanese Occupation of Singapore began.

Four years later, he played "Messala" in Ben-Hur (1959) opposite Charlton Heston. Gore Vidal, who did uncredited work on the screenplay, wanted to give "Messala" a homosexual slant.  He convinced director William Wyler and Boyd that the bitter hatred between the two characters was the result of a gay relationship gone wrong. Heston was furious about this gay angle when he found out about it years later. Boyd won a Golden Globe for his performance in Ben-Hur.

Boyd was the first to be considered for the role of Marc Antony in Cleopatra (1963) opposite Elizabeth Taylor. Production was delayed for months when Taylor fell ill. Boyd dropped out of the production to honor other commitments. He appeared in The Fall of the Roman Empire (1964) with Sophia Loren and Christopher Plummer.

Boyd appeared in other spectacles like Billy Rose's Jumbo (1962), Genghis Khan (1965), and The Bible (1966). He starred in the sci-fi adventure Fantastic Voyage (1966).  His co-star in Voyage, Raquel Welch, made sexual advances to him. He declined with, "An actress is a little bit more than a woman, but an actor is a little bit less than a man." She concluded from this remark (and later reported) that Boyd  was gay. Boyd always had difficulty picking good scripts. His last movies were cheesy exploitation flicks made in Europe. He was married twice for very brief periods of time. He never came out as gay. He died of a heart attack while playing golf in California.

[[James Webb Space Telescope]]

CATEGORIES: Space telescopes

James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is a telescope that will be put into space.  It is planned to be launched in 2021.  It is a replacement for the Hubble Space Telescope which was launched in 1990. 

The telescope is named after James E. Webb, who was a director at NASA and created the Apollo program that put astronauts on the moon.

It will have a main mirror that is 6.5 wide. This is 6 times larger in area than Hubble. It is so large it is made in 18 pieces that fold together during the launch, so that it can fit into a rocket. It is mainly an infrared telescope but also works in the red part of the visible light (the pictures will be coded with false color so we can see them). It is plated with gold because gold reflects  infrared very well. It will be able to see things that the Hubble Space Telescope cannot. Infrared vision can be used to see heat radiation (like some kinds of night vision goggles), so the telescope itself must be kept as cool as possible. It is protected by a large sunshield the size of a tennis court to keep it cool and dark.

[[Lagrange point]]

CATEGORIES: Solar System, Satellites, Mechanics

Lagrange points are stable positions near large bodies in orbit. When two large bodies are in orbit around each other, there are places that a third body can occupy. Lagrange points are found in the orbits of Earth and the Sun, or the Moon and the Earth. The most well-known natural occupants of Lagrange points are Trojan asteroids.

The points are five places where a small object (such as a man-made satellite) can orbit. At those points, the gravitational forces of the two large bodies and forces due to motion all balance up. So, at those places, a small object keeps more or less in a stable position. Dust clouds, asteroids, and man-made satellites are found in those points.

This effect is named after the mathematician Joseph-Louis Lagrange, who wrote a paper on this in 1772 (long before we put satellites into orbit).  

The five places are called L1, L2, L3, L4 and L5.  The first three (L1, L2, L3) are called metastable because if a satellite gets a bit out of place, it will fall away from that point, and not come back without using fuel.  L4 and L5 are considered stable - if a satellite gets a bit out of place, it will be pulled back into place by the gravity and centripetal forces, and oscillate around the Lagrange point.

NASA has inserted satellites into two Lagrange points of the Sun-Earth system.  The L1 point (between the Earth and the sun) is used for satellites that watch the sun, to look for solar flares. The L2 point (beyond the Earth) is used for space telescopes.  That is where the James Webb Space Telescope will go when it is launched.  It is a million miles (about 1.5 million kilometers) from Earth. 

Because L4 and L5 are stable, they have attracted dust clouds, and at least one asteroid (for the Earth-Sun system - the bigger planets have more asteroids in their L4 and L5 points).  These asteroids are called Trojan asteroids.

[[Chaldean Rite]]

CATEGORIES: Eastern Christian denominations

The Chaldean Rite, or East Syrian Rite is a rite that is practiced by the Church of the East and its modern descendants, the Assyrian Church of the East, the Ancient Church of the East, the Chaldean Catholic Church, and the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church.  The Chaldean Catholic Church and the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church are in full communion with the Holy See. Thomas the Apostle established Christianity in Mesopotamia, Assyria, and Persia, when he travelled to India. The First Council of Ephesus in 431, said that the ideas and teachings of Nestorius were false. These teachings are commonly known as Nestorianism. The Church of Seleucia-Ctesiphon did not share this opinion, and split from the other churches. The church was very successful, and quickly spread. The conquest of Tamerlane in the 15th century,  almost destroyed the church, and reduced itto a few communities. Differences in opinion resulted in the current situation. Two of the four churches are in full communion with the Holy See. All the churches commonly use the Syriac language for their texts.

[[United Empire Loyalists]]

CATEGORIES: American Revolutionary War

United Empire Loyalists were people living in the 13 colonies in what was British North America in the 1770s who did not agree with the American Revolution.

Many residents of the colonies (possibly a majority) either were not in complete agreement with the Revolution and its leaders, or were against it. Some of them actively worked against it, supporting King George III and the British Government. These people became known as "Tories". In many of the colonies, those who openly expressed being against the Revolution and those who joined militias loyal to King George were declared to be outlaws, and their properties taken away by the people favouring the Revolution. 

Some of these people wanted to remain in a place that was still part of the British Empire, so they moved to what is now Canada. In many places there they received a warm welcome and became a valued part of their new home area. Many of them have maintained social groups which are limited to people whose ancestors were some of these people, and they are still called "United Empire Loyalists".

[[Translocation (botany)]]

CATEGORIES: Plant physiology

Translocation in vascular plants means the movement of organic molecules and some mineral ions.  Movement of water from the soil to the leaves occurs in xylem vessels as the result of Transpiration. Transpiration, the evaporation of water from leaves, causes a pull on the water column due to the forces of cohesion between water molecules formed due to hydrogen bonds which causes the water to move upwards. Organic materials,  mainly produced in the leaves, are moved around the plant in the living cells of the phloem by a process called translocation.

Unlike xylem (which is composed of dead cells), the phloem is composed of still-living cells that transport sap.  Sap is a water-based solution, rich in sugars made by the photosynthesis. These sugars are transported to non-photosynthetic parts of the plant, such as the roots, or into storage structures, such as tubers or bulbs.

The 'pressure flow' hypothesis was proposed by Ernst Münch in 1930 to explain the mechanism of phloem translocation. Leaves photosynthesize, making sugars. Water moves into the sugar-laden sieve-tube cells with sugar by osmosis. This creating pressure that pushes the sap down the sieve tube. When the sugar reaches cells that need it, the cells actively transport sugars out of the sieve-tube elements.

During the plant's growth period, usually during the spring, storage organs such as the roots are sugar sources, and the plant's many growing areas are sugar sinks. The movement in phloem is multi-directional, whereas, in xylem cells, it is one-directional (upwards). Other molecules like amino acids, hormones, and even messenger RNAs are also transported in the phloem through sieve tube elements.

[[Zither]]

CATEGORIES: String instruments

A zither is a stringed musical instrument. The word Zither is a German rendering of the Greek word cithara, from which the modern word "guitar" also derives. Historically, it has been applied to any instrument of the cittern family, or an instrument consisting of many strings stretched across a thin, flat body – similar to a psaltery. This article describes the second variety.

Zithers are played by strumming or plucking the strings, either with the fingers (sometimes using an accessory called a plectrum or pick), sounding the strings with a bow, or, with varieties of the instrument like the santur or cimbalom, by beating the strings with specially shaped hammers. Like a guitaror lute, a zither's body serves as a resonating chamber (sound box), but, unlike guitars and lutes, a zither lacks a distinctly separate neck assembly. The number of strings varies, from one to more than fifty.

In modern common usage the term "zither" refers to three specific instruments: the concert zither (German: Konzertzither), its variant the Alpine zither (both using a fretted fingerboard), and the chord zither (more recently described as a fretless zither or "guitar zither"). Concert and Alpine zithers are traditionally found in Slovenia, Austria, Hungary, France, north-western Croatia, the southern regions of Germany and alpine Europe. Emigration from these areas during the 19th century introduced the concert and Alpine zither to North and South America. Chord zithers similar to the instrument in the photograph also became popular in North America during the late 19th and early 20th century. These variants all use metal strings, similar to the cittern.

[[Composite Compound 4]]

CATEGORIES: Explosives

 Composite Compound 4 (often abbreviated to C4) is a kind of plastic explosive, which is often used in military operations. C4 is malleable: It can be given almost any form. It can also be handled safely, as neither fire, electricity nor shock will cause an explosion. C4 will explode if force and heat are combined. Because C4 can be given almost any form, additives are used, so that it can be detected more easily. Some of these additives have a distinctive odor, which can be detected by specially trained dogs. Another additive that is used often is metallic powder: This powder can be detected by metal detectors.

[[Para-alpine skiing classification]]

CATEGORIES: Paralympic Games, Skiing

Para-alpine skiing classification is the order system for para-Alpine skiing designed to give equal competition between alpine skiers with different types of limited physical powers. The system of ordering are grouped into three general condition of being unable sorts: stand, unable to see and being seated. Group selection is done by International Paralympic Committee AlpineSkiing. Prior to that, several groups dealt with this including the International Sports Organization for the Disabled (ISOD), International Stoke Mandeville Games Federation (ISMWSF), International Blind Sports Federation (IBSA) and Cerebral Palsy International Sports and Recreation Association (CP-ISRA). Some order systems are persons given government by bodies other than International Paralympic Committee Alpine skiing, such as the Special Olympics. The sport is open to all competitors with a no seeing or physical condition of being unable stand. It is not open to people with intellectual disabilities.

The first order systems for para-Alpine sking were made in Scandinavia in the 1960s, with early systems designed for skiers with no legs or arms. At the time, necessary things had yet to be done to let skiers with spinal cord wounds ski. The purpose of the early order systems was to be made around use of arms and legs but ended up being a medical order system. At the first Winter Paralympics in 1976, there were two groups in the system of ordering for the sport. By the 1980s, groups had existence for skiers with cerebral palsy. At that time, with inspiration from wheelchair basketball classification, efforts were made to make order more of an able to use better system. Ten groups had existence by the 1980s, and since then, efforts have been made to make better the doing work well of order by making fewer the number of classes so fewer medals can be rewarded.

Competition rules for groups use rules made by or are an adjustment from rules by the International Ski Federation. For skiers with seeing problems, guides are used to help the skier down the mountain. For standing skiers, different part rules come to a decision about what sort of necessary things is let in competition, such as one long stick, two sticks or no sticks, or one or two skis.  Seated skiers use a specially designed ski for going over snow quickly called a mono-ski.  Skiers are put in a group based on medical, and their body position when they ski. Unable to see skiers are put in order only on a medical.

Periyar married when he was 19, and had a daughter who lived for only 5 months. His first wife, Nagammai, died in 1933. Periyar married for a second time in July 1948. His second wife, Maniammai, continued Periyar's social work after his death in 1973, but still his thoughts and ideas were being spread by Dravidar Kazhagam.

Periyar fought for the Tamil language, Tamil people and for their rights until his death. He was against Brahmin for their caste and religious following. Periyar organised anti-Hindi protests in 1938, against the introduction of Hindi as a compulsory language of study in schools. Now in the present days the Periyar's followers are increasing more all over the world among the Tamil people, due to their interest in Tamil language and history behind them.

Cyclonic Storm Viyaru, formerly known as Cyclonic Storm Mahasen, was an active tropical cyclone. It passed over the Bay of Bengal. It threatened Myanmar and Bangladesh. Its origin was a low pressure area in the Bay of Bengal. The low pressure area was created in the first week of May. Viyaru slowly developed. It became a depression on May 10 by almost remaining still. Gradually it gained speed on May 11 and became a cyclonic storm. It was the first storm of the season. At first the system's ultimate direction was not clear, but moved closer to eastern India. On May 14, the circulation of Viyaru turned northeastward.

Myanmar recommended a large evacuation in order to be prepared for the storm; however, for this reason people wanted to escape by boat. As a result, they made boats overcrowded, and one or more boats capsized. This killed at least eight people. The storm had extensive cloud mass, which brought unsettled weather to Sri Lanka, Thailand, and southeastern India. Severe storms in India and Sri Lanka killed 15 people and caused major damage. One person was killed in Thailand. 

The name Mahasen caused some argument from nationalists and officials in Sri Lanka. They claimed that the name Mahasen comes from a Sinhala king. He brought prosperity to the island. So naming a destructive force of nature after him would be improper. Sri Lankan authorities instead have not given the storm a name.

Cyclone Viyaru struck Southern Bangladesh on 16 May 2013. The speed of the wind was about 100 kph.

[[Bioturbation]]

CATEGORIES: Ecology, Sedimentology

Bioturbation is the reworking of soils and sediments by animals or plants. It disturbs and changes sediment. Any animal living in the soil or on the bottom under water may disturb the sediment by moving it around. Burrowing, eating and defecation of sediment grains, building galleries (etc.) all disturb the sediment.

Common bioturbators include annelids ("ringed worms") such as oligochaetes, bivalves like mussels, clams, gastropods, holothurians. 

Fossil sites with bioturbation do not leave traces of soft-bodied animals. In contrast, fossil sites with undisturbed sediment have given rise to important lagerstätten with many impressions of small soft-bodied invertebrates.

[[Para-alpine skiing]]

CATEGORIES: Skiing

Alpine skiing is a winter sport. This sport has been adapted to the needs of people with a disability, and is called  Para-alpine skiing. The sport started in Germany and Austria during and after the Second World War. The sport is governed by the International Paralympic Committee Sports Committee. The adaptations used include ski poles (outrigger skis), and a chair on a ski (sit-skis, and mono-skis). Para-alpines skiing types are Downhill, Super-G, Giant Slalom, Slalom, Super Combined, and Snowboard.

Para-alpine skiing classification is the order system for para-alpine skiing. It is designed to give equal competition between alpine skiers with different types of limited physical powers and vision. The ordering system is grouped into three general conditions of being unable: standing, unable to see, and sitting. A factoring system was made for para-alpine skiing. It lets the three classification groups fairly race against other people with the same type of disability.

Alpine skiing was one of the sports at the first Winter Paralympics in 1976, with Slalom and Giant Slalom being raced. Different types of Alpine skiing were made to be at the Paralympic Games over time. The 2010 Winter Paralympics para-alpine skiing races were at Whistler Creekside. The race types at Whistler included Downhill, Super-Combined, Super-G, Slalom, and Giant Slalom.

[[Cooling tower]]

CATEGORIES: Towers, Engineering

Cooling towers are towers that are used to transfer waste heat to the atmosphere. Cooling towers may use the evaporation of water to remove heat and cool the working fluid to near the wet-bulb air temperature. They may also use only air to cool the working fluid to near the dry-bulb air temperature. Cooling towers are used in oil refineries, petrochemical plants and power stations, especially nuclear power stations. In a nuclear power plant, the cooling tower is isolated from the nuclear reactor by a heat exchanger, and the steam from the cooling tower is not radioactive. The cooling tower is usually the tallest and most visible part of a nuclear power plant, much taller than the reactor building or turbine hall.

[[Sandpiper]]

CATEGORIES: Scolopacidae

Sandpipers are a large family of waders or shorebirds, the Scolopacidae. They include many species called sandpipers, as well as those called by names such as curlew and snipe. Most species eat small invertebrates picked out of the mud or soil. Different lengths of bills allow different species to feed in the same habitat on the coast without direct competition for food.

Sandpipers have long bodies and legs, and narrow wings. Most species have a narrow bill, but otherwise the form and length are quite variable. They are small to medium sized birds, measuring 12 cm in length. The bills are sensitive, allowing the birds to feel the mud and sand as they probe for food. They generally have dull plumage, with cryptic brown, grey, or streaked patterns, although some display brighter colours during the breeding season.

Most species nest in open areas, and defend their territories with aerial displays. The nest itself is a simple scrape in the ground, in which the bird usually lays three or four eggs. The young of most species are precocial.

[[Wader]]

CATEGORIES: Charadriiformes

Wader is a common term in ornithology for birds which walk about in shallow water. Sometimes they are called shore-birds. They are members of the order Charadriiformes, which are water birds. The Charadriiformes also includes marine-going seabirds with webbed feet. The evolutionary relationships of these birds are very complicated.

Most waders live in wetland or coastal environments.  Many species of Arctic and temperate regions are strongly migratory, but tropical birds are often resident. Some of the Arctic species, such as little stint, are amongst the longest distance migrants, spending the non-breeding season in the southern hemisphere.

Most species eat small invertebrates picked out of mud or exposed soil. Different lengths of bills allow different species to feed in the same habitat without direct competition for food. Many waders have sensitive nerve endings at the end of their bills which let them detect prey hidden in mud or soft soil. Some larger species, especially those adapted to drier habitats, take larger prey like insects and small reptiles.

Many of the smaller species found in coastal habitats are often called "sandpipers". The smallest member of this group is the least sandpiper, small adults of which can weigh as little as 15.5 grams and measure just over 13 cm (5 inches). The largest species is believed to be the Far Eastern curlew, at about 63 cm (25 inches) and 860 grams (1.9 lb), although the beach thick-knee, is the heaviest at about 1 kg (2.2 lb).

[[Waltz (music)]]

CATEGORIES: Waltzes

Waltz music is written in 3/4 time (three beats per bar). The music is both dance music and art music. The Strauss family were perhaps the most famous of all waltz composers: notably Johann Strauss I, and Johann Strauss II  the composer of the famous The Blue Danube.

Waltzes typically have one chord per measure, and the accompaniment style particularly associated with the waltz is (as seen in the example to the right) to play the root of the chord on the first beat, the upper notes on the second and third beats.

The origins of the dance are in late 18th century Germany, probably from a folk dance called the Lander. Today the music is danced in two forms, the Viennese waltz and the English or Slow waltz (now often called the International waltz). The choreography of these modern forms is different from the original dance. There are also a number of ballets which feature waltz music.

[[Pandeism]]

CATEGORIES: Theology

Pandeism is the belief that a higher being like a God made the Universe, but made it by becoming it. People who follow Pandeism are called Pandeists. After making the Universe, God and the Universe are equivalent (the same thing.) Because God is now the Universe, it can not do things in the Universe. Pandeists believe that people who want to know about God should rely on logic and reason and not traditions of their religion. Pandeists believe that everything that exists is a part of God or that God is a part of everything that exists. The name Pandeism comes from the words Deism (a kind of belief in God) and pan (all). 

Pandeists believe that a higher power became the world. They do not believe that the creation of the Universe happened because of a spontaneous event. They reject supernatural events like miracles and believe that God has become the natural laws as well, and does not need to interfere with them. Pandeists also see holy books, such as the Bible and Qur'an, as writings made by people rather than the writings of God. Pandeists believe that people are part of God too, and so some people think they see or hear God, when they are really only seeing or hearing the part of God that is in them.

[[Planetary science]]

CATEGORIES: Planets, Astronomy

Planetary science (or planetology) is the organized study of planets, which are relatively large, stable bodies in orbits around stars.

The planet best known to us is the Earth. There are seven other major planets in the Solar System. The Solar System also has dwarf planets, such as Pluto and Ceres, the largest asteroid. 

Space probes have gone near or landed on all planets in our solar system. In recent decades better telescopes have found planets in solar systems other than our own, which are known as exoplanets. One of the first was a planet found to be orbiting Barnard's star. 

Planetary science is a part of astronomy and geology. It is sometimes referred to as planetary geology.

Planetary science in a broad sense includes finding a planet's orbital period and orbital distance from its star, the mineral makeup of the planet, and an attempt to learn its age. It may also have a more narrow focus, such as the mapping of the planet's surface features and the makeup of its atmosphere.

[[Marquess]]

CATEGORIES: Royalty and nobility, Titles

Marquess (marquis in French) is a title of nobility in many countries in Europe.  It is  a rank higher than an earl but lower than a duke. 'Marquis' is correct in France, and 'Margrave' in Germany for a local ruler.

This title was usually granted by a monarch to reward a subject for longtime faithful service or some very notable deeds. The title is hereditary, meaning that is passes from a father to his eldest son.  Usually if a man holding this title dies without having any male heirs, the title is said to become extinct, meaning that it is no longer held by anyone living.

The female equivalent of this title may be styled marquess. This rank may be held by the wife of a marquis or granted to a woman in her own right.

A woman with the rank of marquess is called a marchioness in the U.K. and elsewhere a marquise.

Because of a bridge replacement, the two trains were the only way going and coming from New York City.

Investigators believe the trains collided because the tracks were damaged. Some say the damage was done when the trains collided. Others believe it was damaged before the two trains collided with each other. The wreckage of the trains were found to be as far as 200 yards away from the area the accident happened. Many cars that were near the event were heavily damaged. Connecticut governor, Dannel Malloy, believes this investigation will last several days. The FBI were part of the investigations. On May 18, they were no longer a part of the investigation crew.

[[Sedimentology]]

CATEGORIES: Sedimentology

Sedimentology is the study of sediments such as sand, mud (silt), and clay. How they are laid down today is used to understand how rocks were formed. Sedimentologists use their understanding of modern processes to interpret sedimentary rocks and sedimentary structures.

Sedimentary rocks cover most of the Earth's surface, record much of the Earth's history, and contain the fossil record. Sedimentology is closely linked to stratigraphy, which is the study of the physical and temporal (time) relationships between rock layers or strata.

The idea that the processes affecting the earth today are the same as in the past is called uniformitarianism. It is the basis for finding out how sedimentary features in the rock record were formed. By comparing similar features today to features in the rock record—for example, by comparing modern sand dunes to dunes preserved in ancient aeolian sandstones—geologists reconstruct past environments.

[[Geological map]]

CATEGORIES: Geology, Cartography

A geological or geologic map is a special-purpose map made to show geological features.  William Smith made the first geological map of England.

Rock units or strata are shown by colour or symbols which show where they are exposed at the surface.  Three-dimensional features like faults, folds, with symbols which give these features' orientations.

Stratigraphic contour lines may be used to illustrate the surface of a selected strata illustrating the subsurface topographic trends of the strata. Isopach maps detail the variations in thickness of stratigraphic units. It is not always possible to show this properly: the strata may be extremely fractured, mixed, or otherwise disturbed. There are often gaps (discontinuities) where erosion has removed strata.

[[History of video game consoles (fifth generation)]]

CATEGORIES: Video game consoles

The fifth generation of video game consoles began in 1993 and ended in 2003. The fifth generation was also called the 32-bit, 64-bit or the 3D generation of video game consoles. Throughout the fifth generation, only three consoles were among the most popular video game consoles in this era. These consoles include, the Sega Saturn (1994), the Sony PlayStation (1994), and the Nintendo 64 (1996). In different parts of the world, console sales varied widely. However, the PlayStation was the best-selling system of the fifth generation. The 3DO, Atari Jaguar, Amiga CD32 and PC-FX and other consoles were also part of this generation. However, those systems were not very successful. 

The handheld game consoles of the fifth generation were not that successful. The first handheld, Sega Nomad had a lifespan of two years. The Virtual Boy only had less than one year. Both of them were discontinued. Nintendo's Game Boy Color became the best-selling handheld video console of the fifth generation. There were two updated versions of the original Game Boy such as the Game Boy Light (Japan only) and the Game Boy Pocket.

The bit ratings of consoles in the 5th generation began to blur & were less of a selling feature than the previous "bit wars" of the 8 and 16 bit era. The number of "bits" in console names referred to the CPU word size. It had been used by hardware marketers as a "show of power" for many years. The fifth generation saw the increase of emulation. The development of the Internet made it possible to save and download tape and ROM images of older games.

[[History of video game consoles (eighth generation)]]

CATEGORIES: Video game consoles

The eighth generation of video game consoles began in 2012. The eighth generation began with the release of Wii U. The PlayStation 4 was announced on February 20, 2013. It was released worldwide on November 15, 2013.  Microsoft announced the Xbox One on May 21, 2013. It had its first regional release on November 22, 2013. For handheld game consoles, the generation began in February 2011. The first handheld was the Nintendo 3DS. The PlayStation Vita was released in December 2011 in Japan. It was available for the Western countries in February 2012.

It is believed by the video game media that the eighth generation home consoles compete with the smartphone, tablet, and Smart TV gaming markets. Because of this, some analysts incorrectly believed the eight generation would be the last generation of home consoles. Other microconsoles such as the NVIDIA Shield, Steam Box, Ouya and GameStick are attempting to compete in this market. Nintendo officially discontinued the Wii U on January 31, 2017 in anticipation of the March 3, 2017 worldwide release of the Nintendo Switch. The Switch is a "hybrid" console that acts as both a home console and handheld device, and it is unclear if it is a late entry to the eighth generation or the beginning of a ninth generation of home consoles. Computer science teacher Mr. Kerry, has taught pupils about these consoles for years and believes the generations of consoles will stop at around gen 10.

[[Great White Throne Judgment]]

CATEGORIES: Christian eschatology, New Testament, Afterlife

In Christianity, the Great White Throne Judgment is the time when the dead people that did not live during the 1,000 years that Satan was inside the bottomless pit come back to life and are judged by God according to their works using the book that contains all of the evil deeds they committed during their life on earth. This judgment is for those people who are not found written in the Book of Life, a book where the names of those who are going to heaven are written. Once the judgment has been finished, Death, Hades, and those who are not found written in the Book of Life will be cast into the Lake of Fire.

Below, Revelation 20:11-15 is written to show the section of the Bible this judgment appears in.

11 Then I saw a Great White Throne and the one sitting on it. The earth and the heavens fled away from His presence, and there was no place found for them. 12 And I saw the dead, small and great, standing before the throne, and the books were opened. Another book was opened, which is the

Book of Life, and the dead were judged according to their works, which are the things recorded inside the books. 13 The sea gave up the dead which were in it, and Death and Hades gave up the dead which were in them: and they were each judged according to their works. 14 Then Death and Hades were cast into the Lake of Fire, which is the second death. 15 Anyone not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the Lake of Fire.

According to the Bible, the only way to avoid the Great White Throne Judgment is to accept Jesus Christ as your personal Savior. As it is written in John 3:17-18

17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. 18 He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.

[[Fibrinogen]]

CATEGORIES: Blood

Fibrinogen is the clotting element present in blood.  When blood comes out of a wound in a vessel, the fibrinogen is activated and forms fibrin, which clots the blood. Although this is fibrinogen's main job, it also forms bridges between platelets. Fibrinogen is a protein made by the liver. It is a dimer (made up of two similar units). Each unit has an alpha, beta, and gamma chain. The alpha and beta chains have a small peptide called fibrinopeptide. 

When fibrinogen is activated to form fibrin, an enzyme called thrombin cleaves the fibrinopeptides off of the alpha and beta chains.

It is possible to examine a small sample of a person's blood to find out how much fibrinogen is in the blood.  This helps medical professionals to know if too much or too little fibrinogen is the cause of a patient's medical problems.

[[Vili and Vé]]

CATEGORIES: Norse gods and goddesses

In Norse mythology, Vili and Vé are the brothers of Odin. It is said that these three gods made the world. In Old Norse, vili means "will", and vé refers to a type of Germanic shrine

Vé is also known as the god of the seas. He once challenged Odin to a duel over the throne of Asgard. Odin won, and sent his brother to the underworld as punishment.

Vili, however, was loyal to Odin. Since Odin wore gold armour, his brothers Vili wore silver and Vé wore bronze. When Odin threw Vé into the underworld, Vé's armour was taken from him. Eventually, when Ragnarök began, Vé was given back his armour, sword, and powers to join Odin and Vili on a quest to kill the wolf Fenrir. When Fenrir swallowed Odin, his brother Vili thought the war was over and there were no hope so he sacrificed himself to Fenrir.

CATEGORIES: Palaeoproterozoic

The Siderian is the first geological period in the Palaeoproterozoic that began 2.5 billion years ago, and ended at 2.3 billion years ago. Before it was the Neoarchaean It is followed by the Rhyacian.

Banded iron formations (BIFs) became very abundant early this period. BIFs were formed as anaerobic algae produced waste oxygen that combined with iron, forming magnetite (Fe3O4, an iron oxide). This process cleared iron from the oceans, presumably turning greenish seas clear. Eventually, without an oxygen sink in the oceans, the process created the oxygen-rich atmosphere of today. This event is known as the oxygen catastrophe, which according to some geologists triggered the Huronian glaciation. The Huronian glaciation took place in the Siderian between 2400 Mya and 2300 Mya.

[[Observable universe]]

CATEGORIES: Universe

In Big Bang cosmology, the observable universe is what, in theory, can be seen from Earth. That is light, or other signals, which has had time to reach the Earth since the beginning of the cosmological expansion. The observable universe is a spherical volume (a ball) centered on the observer, regardless of the shape of the universe as a whole. Every place in the universe has its own observable universe, which may or may not overlap with the one centered on Earth.

The word observable does not depend on whether modern technology actually allows detection of radiation from an object in this region. It simply means that it is possible in principle for light or other signals from the object to reach an observer on Earth. In practice, there is much that we cannot see. We can see light only from as far back as when particles were first able to emit photons that were not quickly re-absorbed by other particles. Before then, the universe was filled with a plasma that was opaque to photons. 

Sometimes astrophysicists distinguish between the visible universe, which includes only signals emitted since recombination—and the observable universe, which includes signals since the beginning of the cosmological expansion (that is, the end of the inflationary epoch in modern cosmology). The radius of the visible universe, is about 14.0 billion parsecs (about 45.7 billion light years), while the comoving distance to the edge of the observable universe is about 14.3 billion parsecs (about 46.6 billion light years), about 2% larger.

The best estimate of the age of the universe as of 2013 is 13.798 ± 0.037 billion years. Due to the expansion of the universe humans are observing objects that were originally much closer but are now considerably farther away (as defined in terms of cosmological proper distance, which is equal to the comoving distance at the present time) than a static 13.8 billion light-years distance. The diameter of the observable universe is estimated at about 28 billion parsecs (93 billion light-years), putting the edge of the observable universe at about 46–47 billion light-years away.

The principles of the doctrine were so broad that the Soviets used it to justify intervention in the non-Warsaw Pact nation of Afghanistan in 1979, starting the Soviet war in Afghanistan.  The Brezhnev Doctrine stayed in effect until it was ended with the Soviet reaction to the Polish crisis of 1980–1981.

[[NML Cygni]]

CATEGORIES: Red giants, Variable stars, Hypergiants

NML Cygni or V1489 Cygni is a red hypergiant star. It is one of the largest stars known at present. It is about 1,640 times the Sun's radius, However an older study from 2010 says it is 1,183 solar radii. It is one of the extremely luminous supergiant stars. It was discovered in 1965, by Gerry Neugebauer, D.M. Martz and Robert Leighton. The name 'NML' comes from the names of the three discoverers.  

NML Cygni's distance from Earth is about 5,250 light-years. This star has dust  surrounding it. It has a bean-shaped asymmetric nebula with H2O vapour. It is a semiregular variable star with a period of about 940 days. 

This star is a part of the Cygnus OB2 association, which is 1.74 ± 0.2 kpc away. This is one of the nearest massive star groups to the Sun. This group includes some of the most massive and most luminous stars known, including the suspected luminous blue variable Cyg OB2 #12. NML Cyg is a massive oxygen-rich star. Molecules like H2O, SiO, CO, HCN, CS, SO, SO2 and H2S are also present.

NML Cygni has two dense envelopes of dust and molecules. The star has one of the largest mass loss rates at around 2 × 10-4 M☉ per year.  These dust envelopes are formed by the high mass emission rate.

[[Off-by-one error]]

CATEGORIES: Computer science

An Off-by-one error is a logic error that often occurs in Computer programming and that often involve the checking of boundary conditions.

A fencepost error (occasionally called a telegraph pole or lamp-post error) is a specific type of off-by-one error. The following problem illustrates the error:

The intuitive answer 10 is wrong. The fence has 10 sections, but 11 posts.

The reverse error occurs when the number of posts is known and the number of sections is assumed to be the same. The actual number of sections is one less than the number of posts. 

More generally, the problem can be stated as follows:

The correct answer may be n − 1, n, or n + 1, depending on the conditions. The precise problem definition must be carefully considered, as the setup for one situation may give the wrong answer for other situations.  Fencepost errors come from counting things rather than the spaces between them, or vice versa, or by neglecting to consider whether one should count one or both ends of a row.

Off by one errors often occur with loops. If there are a number of fields, eg. in an array, and there is a loop over the array, an off-by-one error means that either there is one iteration too few to cover all elements, or one too many. In the first case, one element of the array is left out, in the second the index of the array will be outside its dimensions. The second error usually leads to an runtime error, because the program checks the size of the data structure, and sees that there are too few elements for the iteration. The first error is more problematic, because it usually is not detected. All that may point to the error is that one element is not initialized or does not have the expected value. 

[[Logic error]]

CATEGORIES: Computer programming

In Computer programming a logic error is a bug in a program, which causes it to work incorrectly. A logic error produces unintended behaviour or output. In many cases, the syntax of the program is correct. This means that the environment used to make the program will not show an error. This makes logic errors difficult to find.

[[Cato the Younger]]

Cato the Younger (Marcus Porcius Cato Uticensis, 95 BC, Rome – April 46 BC, Utica) was a politician and statesman in the late Roman Republic, and a follower of the Stoic philosophy. He was known as Cato Minor to distinguish him from his great-grandfather (Cato the Elder). A noted orator, he had great moral integrity. He could not be bribed, and disliked the political corruption of the age. He is remembered for his stubbornness and for his lengthy conflict with Julius Caesar.

Plutarch tells a story about Cato's peers' immense respect for him, even at a young age. During a Roman ritual military game, called "Troy", in which all aristocratic teenagers participated as a sort of "coming of age" ceremony, a mock battle with wooden weapons was performed on horseback. While the child of one of Sulla's surrogates was chosen by the adult organizers to lead one of the "teams," the team refused to follow him because of his character, and when they were finally asked whom they would follow, the boys unanimously chose Cato.

[[Sodium monofluoroacetate]]

CATEGORIES: Chemical compounds, Poisons

Sodium fluoroacetate is a chemical compound that is a poison for many organisms. Pesticides used kill rodents sometimes contain Sodium monofluoroacetate. Sometimes the chemical substance is used as a marker for cancer cells in Positron emission tomography. TO act as a marker, only very small quantities of a substance are needed. For this reason, the toxicity of Sodium fluoroacetate is not a problem.

 Fluoroacetate occurs naturally in at least 40 plants in Australia, Brazil, and Africa. It was first identified in the poison leaf (gifblaar) Dichapetalum cymosum by Marais in 1944. As early as 1904, colonists in Sierra Leone used extracts of Chailletia toxicaria which also contains fluoroacetic acid or its salts to poison rats. Several native Australian plant genera contain the toxin, including: Gastrolobium, Gompholobium, Oxylobium, Nemcia and Acacia.

[[Starburst galaxy]]

CATEGORIES: Starburst galaxies

A starburst galaxy is a galaxy with a very high rate of star formation. The rate of star formation is so large that the galaxy will quickly use all of its gas reservoir (from which the stars are made). 

So, the starburst nature of a galaxy is a short phase in a galaxy's evolution, just tens of millions of years. Most starburst galaxies are in the midst of a galaxy merger or at least close encounter with another galaxy. 

Studying nearby starburst galaxies can help us explore the history of galaxy formation and evolution. Many very distant galaxies seen, for example, in the Hubble Deep Field are known to be starbursts, but they are too far away to be studied in any detail. Looking at nearby examples give us an idea of what was happening in the early universe. The light we see from distant galaxies left them when the universe was much younger (see redshift). 

Starburst galaxies seem to be quite rare in our local universe, and are more common further away. This suggests there were more of them billions of years ago. All galaxies were closer together then, and therefore more likely to be influenced by each other's gravity. More frequent encounters produced more starbursts as galactic forms evolved with the expanding universe.

In 2005, the Hubble Space Telescope revealed 197 young massive clusters in the starburst core.  The average mass of these clusters is around 25 M⊙, hence the starburst core is a very energetic and high-density environment. Throughout the galaxy's center, young stars are being born 10 times faster than they are inside our entire Milky Way Galaxy.

[[Baby boom galaxy]]

CATEGORIES: Starburst galaxies

The Baby boom galaxy  is a starburst galaxy 12.2 billion light years away.

It was discovered by NASA's Spitzer Science Center at the California Institute of Technology. The galaxy is the new record holder for the brightest starburst galaxy in the very distant universe, its brightness being a measure of its extreme star-formation rate.

The Baby boom galaxy has been called "the extreme stellar machine" because it is seen producing stars at a surprising rate of up to 4,000 per year. Our Milky Way galaxy turns out an average of just 10 stars per year.

At its rate, the galaxy needs only 50 million years to grow into an equivalent of the most massive galaxy ever observed.

The discovery challenges the accepted model for galaxy formation. This has most galaxies slowly bulking up by absorbing pieces of other galaxies, rather than growing internally. Another unusual aspect is the fact that scientists are observing this galaxy at a time when the universe was only a little over 1.4 billion years old. Evidently, the galaxy was doing this when the universe was still in its infancy.

"This galaxy is undergoing a major baby boom, producing most of its stars all at once", said Peter Capak of NASA's Spitzer Science Center. To that, the principal investigator of the Cosmic Evolution Surveyor, Nick Scoville of Caltech responded:

"We may be witnessing, for the first time, the formation of one of the most massive elliptical galaxies in the universe".

The Pontian Greek Genocide (Greek: Genoktonia ton Ellinon tou Póntou) was a genocide by the Young Turks in the Ottoman Empire during World War I. It is estimated that at least 1,100,000 Pontic Greeks were killed during the raids and the massacres.

Many Pontian Greeks were considered unpure by the Turks and were massacred for not giving up their Christianity and becoming Muslims. The Pontian Greeks lost their homes and possessions to the sultan, Adulhamed the Red. Even before the genocide, they had been persecuted and forced to pay high taxes.

Since ancient times and the conquest of the Trebizond Empire, the Pontian Greeks have not have had their own nation. Their diaspora has spread to many different countries. Under the rule of Kurds and Ottomans, the Pontian Greeks were oppressed and assimilated to society, and many lost their independence. Those who have survived keep their common unity, especially in their deep Christian faith.

The Pontian Greek genocide took place in the same context and period as the Assyrian and the Armenian genocides.

Kamoya Kimeu (born c. 1940), a Kamba tribesman, is one of the world's most successful fossil collectors. With paleontologists Meave Leakey and Richard Leakey, he found some of the most significant paleoanthropological discoveries. Kimeu found a Homo habilis skull known as KNM ER 1813, and an almost complete Homo erectus skeleton  known as Turkana Boy or Nariokotome boy. He has two fossil primates named after him: Kamoyapithecus hamiltoni and Cercopithecoides kimeui.

Kimeu began to work in paleoanthropology as a labourer for Louis Leakey and Mary Leakey in the 1950s. He was recruited for Mary Leakey's team when she took over as head of excavations at Olduvai. She preferred to hire Kamba men rather than Kikuyu, whom Louis preferred. In 1963 he joined with Richard Leakey's expeditions, accompanying him to the Omo River and Lake Rudolf (now Lake Turkana) in 1967. 

He quickly became Richard  Leakey's right-hand man, controlling field operations in Leakey's absence. In 1977 he became the National Museums of Kenya's curator for all prehistoric sites in Kenya. Kimeu was awarded the National Geographic Society's LaGorce Medal by the US President Ronald Reagan in a ceremony at the White House.

Martin and his family joined a Separatist church. They all wanted to go to the New World.  Martin sold his property and bought passage on the ship.

The people asked Martin to help them by buying supplies.  He did not spent the money wisely.  He purchased things like beer, wine, salted beef and pork, dried peas, fishing supplies, muskets, armor, clothing, tools, and other things to trade with the Native Americans.  One thing he purchased, the screw-jack, would be very useful to keep the Mayflower from sinking.

[[Eyespot]]

CATEGORIES: Vision

An eyespot is a simple organ in biology used to detect light. It may be called an ocellus, or pigment pit. They are quite common in small, simple invertebrates, such as Planaria. They do not have lenses or any means of focussing. Therefore, they can sense light from dark, but do not give the animal a visual scene as our eyes do.

In many simple animals the eyespot senses light with a pigment molecule called an opsin. Then a nerve fibre goes from the eyespot to the simple nervous system. This allows the animal to move in response to (for example) a shadow passing over it.

Eyespots also occur in single-celled protists like Euglena and Chlamydomonas, where it is connected to the flagellum. This allows the information from the light patch to influence the cells's movement.

The first fossils of eyes that have been found to date are from the early Cambrian period (about 540 million years ago). This period saw a burst of apparently rapid evolution, called the "Cambrian explosion". One idea is that the evolution of eyes started an arms race which led to a rapid spate of evolution. Much earlier than this organisms would have used light spots for light sensitivity, but did not have a visual scene for rapid navigation.

[[Managed motorway]]

CATEGORIES: Motorways in the United Kingdom

Managed motorways in the United Kingdom are motorways which use active traffic management. Their aim is to increase traffic capacity at times of peak traffic flow. They use variable speed limits and hard shoulder running at busy times. A "hard shoulder" is an inner lane which in normal times is only used for emergencies.

Active traffic management was first used in 2005. The system is now in operation on sections of the M1, M4, M6, and M42, and there are proposals for its use on sections of the M5, M25, M60 and M62. 

Benefits include smoother traffic flows, more reliable journey times, fewer road traffic collisions, and reduced noise and harmful vehicle emissions. Where only variable speed limits are used, it is called a controlled motorway.

[[Medullary ray]]

CATEGORIES: Plant anatomy, Plant tissues

In botany, medullary rays (pith rays or wood rays) are sheets or ribbons of cells running from the inside of the plant to the outside. That is, they run at right angles to the xylem and phloem, which run vertically. While the plant is alive, these medullary cells are alive. They carry nutrients (sap) towards the surface of the tree.

In wood products the rays can be seen running perpendicular to the growth rings. If wood is cut into boards with the growth rings roughly perpendicular to the face of the board, the medullary rays often produce beautiful "figure" such as silver grain, medullary spots, pith flecks, etc.

The function of medullary rays is to carry chemicals which fight invasion by insects and fungi, and block any damaged areas. The cells deposit tannins and resins which block up the damaged area. This process is called tylosis.

[[Cytokine storm]]

CATEGORIES: Immunology, Diseases

A cytokine storm is an overreaction of the body's immune system. It can be deadly. It consists of a positive feedback loop between cytokines and immune cells.

It is believed that cytokine storms were responsible for many of the deaths during the 1918 influenza pandemic, which killed a disproportionate number of young adults.  In this case, a healthy immune system may have been a liability rather than an asset. Preliminary research results from Hong Kong also suggest this as the probable reason for many deaths during the SARS epidemic in 2003. Human deaths from the bird flu H5N1 usually involve cytokine storms as well.

CATEGORIES: Prisons, British India, Kolkata

Black Hole of Calcutta was a dungeon in old Fort William, Calcutta, India. It was 18 feet (5.5 metres) long and 14 feet (4 metres) wide, and had two small windows. 

The fort was built by the British to defend their trading interests in Calcutta. During hostilities in 1756, the fort was captured by the army of the Nawab of Bengal on 20 June. John Zephaniah Holwell, a British eyewitness, reported that those taken in the capture of the fort, numbering 146, were confined to the dungeon, and that only 23 survived.

[[Vellum]]

CATEGORIES: Writing media, Materials

Vellum is a high-quality form of parchment. Originally, it meant calf skin, but in English the term is used more widely.

Like parchment, the skin is prepared to take writing in ink. It was one of the standard writing surfaces used in Europe before paper became available. It continued to be used for high-status documents. The vellum was used for single pages, scrolls, codices or books.

To manufacture vellum, the skin is cleaned, then bleached, stretched on a frame called a "herse", and scraped with a knife. When vellum is scraped, it is by turns wet and dry to create tension. A final finish is got by rubbing the surface with pumice, and treating it with lime or chalk. Then it is ready to accept ink.

Modern "paper vellum" (sometimes called vegetable vellum) is made out of synthetic material instead of mammal skin, but is used for the same purpose as normal vellum.

[[Conus]]

CATEGORIES: Gastropods

Conus is a large genus of small to large predatory sea snails, marine gastropod molluscs, with the common names of cone snails, cone shells or cones.

Shaped, as the name suggests, like a cone, many species have colorful patterning on the shell surface. Conus snails are mostly tropical in distribution. Geologically speaking, the genus is known from the Eocene to the present.

All Conus snails are venomous. They hunt and eat marine worms or molluscs. The larger ones prey on small bottom-dwelling fish. Cone snails use a hypodermic-like modified radula tooth and a venom gland to attack and paralyze their prey before eating it. The tooth is sometimes likened to a dart or a harpoon. It is barbed and can be extended some distance out from the mouth of the snail, at the end of the proboscis. They can "sting" humans, and should be handled with great care or preferably not at all.

Cone snail venoms are mainly peptides. The venoms contain many different toxins that vary in their effects; some are extremely toxic. The sting of small cones is no worse than a bee sting, but the sting of some larger species can be serious, occasionally even fatal to humans. Cone snail venom may be a source of new, medically important substances. 

Some Cone snails are no longer living, like Conus adversarius.

E-waste is a concern for every country in the 21st century. Because of Moore's law, the rule that states transistor numbers double every two years, people upgrade computers every 3 years on average. People usually throw away their old laptops, cameras, computers, cell phones and televisions. This creates a large amount of practically useless waste. Most countries have methods to combat e waste and find a use for obsolete technology. When you take in to account all the computer users in the world, over 30 million tons of e-waste is created nearly every year, along with a few billions of tons of other waste.

[[Gorboduc]]

CATEGORIES: Drama, Plays, History of England, 16th century works, 1560s

The Tragedy of Gorboduc is the earliest English tragedy in blank verse. It was written by Thomas Sackville and Thomas Norton. The writers took the story of the play from Geoffrey of Monmouth's History of the Kings of Britain (1138). The play premiered before Queen Elizabeth I on 18 January 1561. It was first printed in 1565. It was printed again in 1570 as The Tragedy of Ferrex and Porrex.

The play is about a good king named Gorboduc. He gives his kingdom away during his lifetime to his sons. The sons quarrel over the throne. Porrex, the younger son, kills his brother, Ferrex. Their mother, Queen Videna, avenges the death of her older son by murdering Porrex. Gorboduc and Videna are then killed by their horrified former subjects.

Norton wrote the first three acts; Sackville wrote the last two. The playwrights took the tragedies of the Latin writer Seneca as their model,  but ignored the classical unities of time and place.  They used Classical elements such as the Chorus and the Messenger, but added non-Classical elements such as dumb shows (pantomimes) before each act.
