[[Blue space]]

CATEGORIES: Lakes, Bodies of water, Rivers, Public health, Urban design

In urban planning and design, blue space or blue infrastructure refers to all the areas which have bodies of water or water courses (that is lakes, rivers, and bays). Together with greenspace (parks, gardens and the like), it allows to lower the temperature in the city (called urban heat island). 

Many cities have waterbodies. Very often, these waterbodies have been important in the history of the city. One such example is the  River Thames in London.

Accessible blue spaces can help revitalize neighborhoods. It can also promote the people feeling like they belong together. Examples of such project are the  Chattanooga Waterfront (Chattanooga, Tennessee),  the CityDeck in Green Bay, Wisconsin, or the Brooklyn Bridge Park in New York City. Festivals at the waterfront also help promote this feeling. 

Neighborhoods with access to attractive natural features often have the problem of gentrification, people with more money, a better education or a higher social class will move in, and lead to a price increase. For this reason, the social benefits associated with waterbodies are often not distributed equally. Normal neighborhoods and poorer ones often do not have access to good quality blue spaces.

[[Twelve Tables]]

CATEGORIES: Ancient Roman law

The Law of the Twelve tables (Leges Duodecim Tabularum or Duodecimo Tabulae) was the legislation that stood at the foundation of Roman law. Formally promulgated in 449 BC, the Tables were mostly a summary earlier traditions written down as a set of laws.

Displayed in the Forum, "The Twelve Tables" stated the rights and duties of the Roman citizen.  Their formulation was the result of considerable agitation by the plebeian class, who had until then been excluded from the higher benefits of the Republic.  Before that, the law had not been written down. Higher-class priests, the pontifices, intepreted it.   Cicero (106–43 BC) stated that the "Twelve Tables...seems to me, assuredly to better than the libraries of all the philosophers, both in weight of authority, and in usefulness".  Cicero hardly exaggerated; the Twelve Tables formed the basis of Roman law for a thousand years.

The Twelve Tables are rather comprehensive, they have been described as a 'code'. Modern scholars consider this characterization exaggerated. The Tables were a sequence of definitions of various private rights and procedures. They generally took for granted such things as the institutions of the family and various rituals for formal transactions. The provisions were often highly specific and diverse.

On 15 August 2021, the Taliban took over the city of Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan. This means that they won the war against the Afghan government. This happened because of a a military offensive that began in May 2021, which was the latest stage of their insurgency against the Afghan government.

The capture took place hours after President Ashraf Ghani escaped from the country. U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to remove troops from Afghanistan, followed by his replacement Joe Biden continuing to do so, made it easier for the Taliban to take power. 

In the days before and after Kabul's fall, thousands of civilians left the country and thousands of others have failed in their attempts to do so. Many Afghan women are scared because they don't know how the Taliban will treat women in Afghanistan.

On 30 August 2021, evacuations from Afghanistan ended, allowing Taliban to take full control of the country and ending the War in Afghanistan.

This is the opposite of satisfaction. It is called dissatisfaction. Dissatisfaction occurs when we fail at doing something many times. Dissatisfaction occurs when comparing yourself to another person. This is called social comparison theory. Ongoing dissatisfaction causes complacency, apathy and even depression.

Satisfaction does not occur automatically. Satisfaction is the process of coping with life. Humans are in a constant fight against dissatisfaction. The Dalai Lama spoke about this: 

"When you are discontent, you always want more, more, more. Your desire can never be satisfied. But when you practice contentment, you can say to yourself, "Oh yes—I already have everything that I really need."

If someone slips into total dissatisfaction, they might experience anguish. A person is more likely to be happy and satisfied if they learn how to control their negative experiences and to process positive thoughts. Usually, a person does not share their satisfaction with other people. That is called pride. 

Satisfaction, like all emotions, is a motivator of behavior. Satisfaction is an important part of one's quality of life. In positive psychology, researchers are studying what gives a person satisfaction in life.

Delayed gratification is a part of satisfaction. Delayed gratification is when a person chooses long-term rewards over immediate rewards. Delayed gratification is also when a person prioritizes long-term objectives over closer targets. When a person delays gratification, they feel satisfied.

Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day (Fête de la Saint-Jean-Baptiste, la Saint-Jean, Fête nationale du Québec), also known in English as St John the Baptist Day is an official holiday in the Canadian province of Quebec. It takes place annually on June 24. Although, it is not the official name of this holiday, it is popularly known and called in Quebec, as the Fête nationale du Quebec (National Holiday of Quebec).

Originally a religious day, it was brought to Canada by French settlers in the 1600s, celebrating the traditional feast day of the Nativity of Saint John the Baptist. It was declared a public holiday in Quebec in 1925. In 1977, Quebec declared Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day the national day of Quebec.

Other Canadian provinces and territories also have their own official holidays celebrating the foundation of their provinces or territories. Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day differs from them, that it is today celebrated like a national day rather than a religious holiday, because it became highly politicized with the rise of Quebec nationalism and separatism. As a result, the religious symbolism of this day is largely forgotten, and acts as a counter holiday for Quebec nationalists and separatists against Canada Day.

CATEGORIES: Birds of China, Birds of Asia

The spotted dove (Spilopelia chinensis) is a small long-tailed pigeon that is a common and native to the Indian subcontinent and in Southeast Asia. The species has been introduced to many parts of the world and feral populations have become established.

This species was formerly included in the genus Streptopelia with other turtle-doves, but studies suggest that they differ from typical members of that genus. This dove is long tailed buff brown with a white-spotted black collar patch on the back and sides of the neck. The tail tips are white and the wing coverts have light buff spots.

There are considerable plumage variations across populations within its wide range. The species is found in light forests and gardens as well as in urban areas. They fly from the ground with an explosive flutter and will sometimes glide down to a perch. It is also called the mountain dove, pearl-necked dove, lace-necked dove, and spotted turtle-dove.

[[Spilopelia]]

Spilopelia is a genus of doves that are closely related to Streptopelia, yet distinguished from them by differences in morphology and behavior. Some authors have argued that Stigmatopelia is the valid name as it appears in an earlier line although also erected by the Swedish zoologist Carl Sundevall, but Richard Schodde and Ian J. Mason in their zoological catalogue of Australian birds chose Spilopelia citing clause 24(b) of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) which supports the decision of the first reviser. The name Spilopelia combines the Ancient Greek spilos meaning "spot" and peleia meaning "dove".

[[Diabetes in dogs]]

CATEGORIES: Pets, Diabetes mellitus, Controversies

Diabetes mellitus in dogs happens when the beta cells in the pancreas stop producing insulin (leading to type 1 diabetes) or produce enough insulin though cells improperly use it (leading to type 2 diabetes).

Diabetes in dogs can be treated. It doesn't need to make the life expectancies of dogs shorter than usual. If not treated, however, the condition could lead to cataracts, malnutrition, diabetic ketoacidosis, dehydration and possibly death. Diabetes mostly affects middle-aged and older dogs. There are, however, juvenile cases. The typical dog with diabetes is overweight or obese and middle-aged. Females are affected almost three times more often than male dogs. But there are arguments about whether or not neutering male dogs may increase the risks of developing diabetes. Some data mention that male dogs' risks of becoming obese double or triple after they are neutered.

Diabetes is commonly split into two types: type 1 and type 2.

Type 1 diabetes (previously called "juvenile diabetes") happens when the beta cells of the pancreas are either destroyed or severely damaged. The condition, in the past, was also called "insulin-dependent diabetes". That means insulin injections must replace the insulin the pancreas is no longer capable of producing for the body's needs. Type 1 is the most common form of diabetes and affects approximately 0.34% of dogs. 

Type 2 diabetes does develop in dogs. However, this form is not as common as type 1. Because of this, there is no possibility the permanently damaged pancreatic beta cells could re-activate to bring about a remission (meaning no evidence of the disease) as may be possible with some feline diabetes cases. In cats, the usual type of diabetes is type 2. 

Gestational diabetes does happen in dogs. The condition, though, does not happen in dogs as often as for human beings.

A trade name, trading name, or business name is a pseudonym used by companies that do not operate under their registered company name. The term for this type of alternative name is a "fictitious" business name. Registering the fictitious name with a relevant government body is often required.

In a number of countries, the phrase "trading as" (abbreviated to t/a) is used to designate a trade name. In the United States, the phrase "doing business as" (abbreviated to DBA, dba, d.b.a. or d/b/a) is used, among others, such as assumed business name or fictitious business name. In Canada, "operating as" (abbreviated to o/a) and "trading as" are used, although "doing business as" is also sometimes used.

A company typically uses a trade name to conduct business using a simpler name rather than using their formal and often lengthier name. Trade names are also used when a preferred name cannot be registered, often because it may already be registered or is too similar to a name that is already registered.

Her father was a minister of the then Ancient Moirang kingdom, in charge of collecting tributes from the land of Kabo (present day Western Myanmar).

However, after her mother's untimely death, her father remarried with Nganurol Laoshigam Chanu (Loisingam Chanu), the sister of her mother. Spending a few days happily, Senbi Loikenba left for Kabo on the King's errand and during his absence, Haosi Namoinu was harshly treated by her stepmother. She was not allowed to go outside and play with her friends. She had to work as much hard as she could to satisfy her stepmother. Her bliss of household life was much worsened.

Her stepmother ordered her work after work and she completed it with no rest. She was forced to husk the rice, tired as she was, again she had to cook food for them and serve but she uttered no lamentation. Her stepmother's ruthlessness came to the highest degree and she ordered Haosi Namoinu, that if she wanted to join the feast (spring festival), she had to go to the maternal grandparents' house and bring a load of paddy rice (un-husked rice). She did so, but her stepmother was still not satisfied, and struck her head with a cookery utensil. Having being deprived of all youthful delights, the girl transformed herself into a Hari Nongnang (cicada) (or cricket in some version), with her clothes as wings and feathers, and flew away with ravishing tears.

This legendary account is engraved in as one of the two stories in the Khongjomnubi Nongarol.

[[London Protocol (1830)]]

CATEGORIES: 19th century in Greece

The London Protocol of 3 February 1830 was an agreement between the three Great Powers (The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, The Kingdom of France and the Russian Empire), which amended the decisions of the 1829 protocol and established Greece as an independent, sovereign state.

As a result of the Greek War of Independence, which had begun in 1821, and the Great Powers' intervention in the conflict in the Battle of Navarino (1827), the creation of some form of Greek state in southern Greece had become certain. In 1827, the Greek Third National Assembly entrusted the governance of the fledgling nation to Ioannis Kapodistrias, who arrived in Greece in January 1828. Alongside his efforts to lay the foundations for a modern state, Kapodistrias undertook negotiations with the Great Powers as to the extent and constitutional status of the new Greek state.

In March 1829, the foreign ministers of the Great Powers signed the first London Protocol, according to which Greece would become an autonomous, tributary state under Ottoman suzerainty, under an elected Christian prince and encompassing the heartlands of the Greek uprising, the Morea (Peloponnese), Continental Greece and the Cyclades. Kapodistrias' diplomatic manoeuvres, aided by the Russian victory in the Russo-Turkish War of 1828–29, resulted in a revision of the protocol on 3 February 1830. According to it, Greece would be fully independent from the Ottoman Empire, but its borders were reduced to the Aspropotamos–Spercheios line. Leopold of Saxe-Coburg (the future King of Belgium) was selected as the first King of Greece, but he rejected the offer.

The protocol was yet again amended in the London Conference of 1832, which established the final borders of the Kingdom of Greece and gave the crown to the Bavarian prince Otto.

[[Giant clam]]

The giant clams are the members of the clam genus Tridacna that are the largest living bivalve mollusks. There are actually several species of "giant clams" in the genus Tridacna, which are often misidentified for Tridacna gigas, the most commonly intended species referred to as “the giant clam”.

Tridacna gigas is one of the most endangered clam species. Antonio Pigafetta documented these in his journal as early as 1521. One of a number of large clam species native to the shallow coral reefs of the South Pacific and Indian oceans, they can weigh more than 200, measure as much as 120 across and have an average lifespan in the wild of over 100 years. They are also found off the shores of the Philippines and in the South China Sea in the coral reefs of Sabah (Malaysian Borneo).

The giant clam lives in flat coral sand or broken coral and can be found at depths of as much as 20 m (66 ft). Its range covers the Indo-Pacific, but populations are diminishing quickly, and the giant clam has become extinct in many areas where it was once common. The maxima clam is found most commonly among giant clam species; it can be found off high- or low-elevation islands, in lagoons or fringing reefs. Its rapid growth rate is likely due to its ability to grow algae in its body tissue.

Although larval clams are planktonic, they become sessile in adulthood. The creature's mantle tissues act as a home for the symbiotic single-celled dinoflagellate algae (zooxanthellae) from which the adult clams get most of their food. By day, the clam opens its shell and extends its mantle tissue so that the algae get the sunlight they need to photosynthesize.

[[Trousers as women's clothing]]

CATEGORIES: Trousers and shorts, Women's rights, Feminism, Everyday life, Clothing controversies

Trousers (called pants in American English) first showed up in recorded history with the nomadic people across Western Europe. Archeological studies show men/boys and women/girls wore trousers and pants in relation to past societal cultures. For most of modern history, though, wearing pants/trousers was usually restricted to men and boys. In several regions across the world, such patterns were applied not just by social rules but also through laws.

Different United States cities, in the 19th and 20th centuries, passed legislation that banned women and girls from wearing trousers/pants. One such law was passed by the San Francisco Supervisors' Board in 1863. This law made appearing in public wearing clothes of the opposite sex (males wearing female clothing or females wearing male clothes) illegal. Similar laws were already in effect for Chicago (passed in 1851) and Columbus, Ohio (passed in 1848). Further laws against cross-dressing were put into effect for Houston, Texas (passed in 1864) and Orlando, Florida (went into effect in 1907). Another almost two dozen United States cities also had these laws. Further laws against cross-dressing were put into effect far into the 20th century. They were made effective for Detroit, Michigan and Miami, Florida as recently as the 1950s. 

[[Reproductive rights]]

CATEGORIES: Women's rights, Controversies, Biological reproduction, Abortion

Reproductive rights rest on the recognition of the basic right of all couples and individuals to decide freely and responsibly the number, spacing and timing of their children and to have the information and means to do so, and the right to attain the highest standard of sexual and reproductive health. They also include the right of all to make decisions concerning reproduction free of discrimination, coercion and violence.

Women's reproductive rights may include some or every of these: rights to receive education on sexually transmitted disease, freedoms from forced sterilizations or contraceptions, rights to menstrual health and abortion-rights movements.

[[Bachelor of Engineering]]

CATEGORIES: Bachelor's degrees, Engineering education

A Bachelor of Engineering (abbreviated as B.E., B.Eng. or B.A.I. in Latin form) is a first professional undergraduate academic degree awarded to a student after three to five years of studying engineering at an accredited university. In the UK, a B.Eng. degree will be accredited by one of the Engineering Council's professional engineering institutions as suitable for registration as an incorporated engineer or chartered engineer with further study to masters level. In Canada, the degree from a Canadian university can be accredited by the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board (CEAB). Alternatively, it might be accredited directly by another professional engineering institution, such as the US-based Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). The B.Eng. contributes to the route to chartered engineer (UK), registered engineer or licensed professional engineer and has been approved by representatives of the profession.

A B.E. has a greater emphasis on math and science, to allow the engineers to move from one discipline to another. Multi-discipline is required in certain fields, like Marine Engineering. The marine engineer is required to know mechanical, chemical and electric engineering. If an engineer is strictly staying in a single discipline, he/she would probably be better served with a B.Sc. A typical B.Sc. is 128 credits. SUNY Maritime B.E. is 172 credits.

Most universities in the United States and Europe award the Bachelor of Science Engineering (B.Sc.Eng.), Bachelor of Engineering (B.Eng.), Bachelor of Engineering Science (B.Eng.Sc.), Bachelor of Science in Engineering (B.S.E.) or Bachelor of Applied Science (B.A.Sc.) degree to undergraduate students of engineering study. For example, Canada is the only country that awards the B.A.Sc. degree for graduating engineers. Other institutions award engineering degrees specific to the area of study, such as B.S.E.E. (Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering)  and B.S.M.E. (Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering).

In French-speaking Canada, mainly Québec, the Bachelor of Engineering is referred to as B.Ing (Baccalauréat en ingénierie).

A less common and possibly the oldest variety of the degree in the English-speaking world, is Baccalaureus in Arte Ingeniaria (B.A.I.), a Latin name meaning Bachelor in the Art of Engineering. Here Baccalaureus in Arte Ingeniaria implies an excellence in carrying out the 'art' or 'function' of an engineer. The degree is awarded by the University of Dublin (its Trinity College Dublin has had a School of Engineering since 1841) and also by the constituent universities of the National University of Ireland (N.U.I.)June 2017, but in everyday speech it is more commonly referred to as Bachelor of Engineering and the N.U.I. graduates also use the post-nominals translated into English, B.E., even though the actual degree and its parchment is in LatinJune 2017.

Some South African Universities refer to their engineering degrees as B.Ing. (Baccalaureus Ingenieurswese, in Afrikaans).

[[Boana almendarizae]]

CATEGORIES: Frogs, Animals of South America

Almendariz's tree frog  (Boana almendarizae) is a frog that lives in Ecuador.  Scientists have seen it between 500 and 1950 meters up in the Andes Mountains.

The adult male frog is 3.4 to 4.5 cm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 3.8 to 5.2 cm long.

This frog's back is light brown to reddish brown in color, sometimes with dark bands or lines across.  It has one larger medium-brown line down each side of its body, and small white and brown spots across its back.  Some of the large female frogs have blue on their sides.  Males have light blue on their sides.  This frog has large eyes.

This species hides during the day and looks for food at night.  People find it on plants not more than 1.5 meters above the ground, especially near the edges of bodies of water, such as rivers, flooded places, and small ponds.  This frog is sympatric with Boana calcarata.  That means scientists think they had the same ancestor, and they became different frog species even though they lived in the same place.

[[Tapta]]

CATEGORIES: Meitei folklore, Meitei literature

Tapta (/tap-taa/) is a fictional, imaginary and non-existing character in Meitei folklore of Ancient Manipur (Antique Kangleipak). It is an amusing as well as scary creature described by a mother's imagination to her child, to stop his cry. Etymologically, "Tapta" is made of two words, "Tap" (sound of water drops falling on the ground) and "Ta" (literally meaning "to fall") in Meitei (Manipuri). 

Once there was a child who never stopped crying.

One night, when it was raining heavily, a thief came to steal a horse from the house of the child and a tiger also came to prey on one of the horses from the same place. As the two criminals were silently waiting a right time for their chances in the dark corners of the horse-stable, they heard the mother ("father" in another version) telling her child about many scary creatures, like the elephant, the horse, the lion and the tiger coming, to pacify his crying but it was of no use to the child.

And the non-stop weeping child suddenly remained silent when the mother mentioned the name "Tapta". So, both the thief and the tiger believed that "Tapta" might surely be a dangerous creature. In the darkness, the thief started searching for the horses in the horse-stable. And as he was touching things one by one in the darkness, it coincided that he held the legs of the hiding tiger, thinking it as one of the horses in the stable. And the tiger thought that the person holding him would be none other than the so called "Tapta". And so, the ferocious tiger behaved like an obedient pet animal, fearing of the "Tapta". In the darkness of the stable, the thief prepared reins and saddles on the tiger ("false horse") and drove him away towards the woods. Again in the darkness of the woods, the tiger still believed that the person riding on and driving him was the so called "Tapta". And during the dawn, when there was abundant light, the thief recognised that the creature he had stolen was not a horse but a tiger. So, he tried to escape himself from the driving beast but the tiger never stopped running. 

The thief saw a branch of a tree on the way the tiger was running. And with intelligent and quick steps, he jumped on the branch leaving the tiger alone running. A few moments later, the tiger realised the absence of the "Tapta" (actually, the thief) from his back. So, he thought that "Tapta" might even be able to fly on the air, that was how he was gone from him. So, on his way back to home, the tiger met many other animals, including a bear, an elephant, a fox and even another tiger (variable according to different versions of the story), to whom he narrated all the incidents. All these animals did not trust him and asked him to take them to the spot where the "Tapta" had freed him. On the other hand, the thief hid himself on a "tree hole" ("tree hollow") of the same tree, on whose branch he had jumped on. As the animals led by the tiger came to the spot, the tiger told them that the very spot was nearby the tree with a hole (where the thief was hiding). So, in searching for the "Tapta", they met many unlucky circumstances, leading them to believe in what the tiger had said to be correct. For example, when the bear inserted  his small tail to the tree hollow, the thief pulled it inwards with his full strength and let it go off, that the bear fell on the ground. When the elephant inserted his trunk into the tree hollow, the thief hurted it with something (probably with a stick) so hard that the elephant yelled with pain. Finally, all of these animals approached to the lion, His Highness of the forest, and narrated all the incidents. So, the lion decided to check out the matter by Himself. Meanwhile, the thief had escaped and ran away for safety. And as the lion arrived, there was no one at that place. But the other animals still believe that there is a dangerous creature called the "Tapta".

Primary production is the synthesis of organic compounds from  carbon dioxide.  It occurs by photosynthesis. Light is its source of energy. It also occurs through chemosynthesis, which uses the oxidation or reduction of inorganic chemical compounds as its source of energy.  

Almost all life on Earth relies directly or indirectly on primary production. The organisms responsible for primary production are known as primary producers or autotrophs. They form the base of the food chain. On land, these are mainly plants; in the sea (or lakes) algae do this role. Also, there are shallow water oxygen primary producers like sea grass.

By photosynthesis or chemosynthesis, energy is used to make complex organic molecules from simpler inorganic compounds (such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O). The following are simplified equations of photosynthesis (top) and (one form of) chemosynthesis (bottom):

[[Rape culture]]

CATEGORIES: Rape, Cultural studies

In sociology, rape culture is a term that is used to describe a society where rape is common. This is mostly due to the views these societies have about gender and sexuality.  Other behaviours that can often be found include victim blaming and sexual objectification. People in these societies may trivialize rape, or they say that it isn't much of a problem. They  also often deny the fact that  sexual violence is causing harm to the the victim. Very often, there is a combination of all these issues.

The term rape culture has also been used for other settings, or to describe the behavior of specific groups of people: Examples of these are people being raped in prison, or using rape in a war, as a form of psychological warfare. 

That way, entire societies have been called rape cultures.

Some people also have sexual fantasies about raping someone, or being raped; in that context, their ideas may be seen as part of pornography.  

Second-wave feminists first had the idea of 'rape culture', in the 1970s. Most of them came from the United States. 

Critics of the concept say that it doesn't exist or is not widespread. They also say that even if there may be societies where rape is common, the concept of 'rape culture' implies that the person who rapes is not at fault; rather it is the society that made the rape possible. 

There are many movements who have addressed the idea of rape culture. They include movements such as SlutWalk and Me Too. Tatiana Burke, an American activist started Me Too, after she was sexually assaulted in 2006.  Some of these movements have developed into self-help groups, where victims can talk about their experiences, and help each other.

[[File inclusion vulnerability]]

CATEGORIES: Internet security

A file inclusion vulnerability is a type of web vulnerability that is most commonly found to affect web applications that rely on a scripting run time. This issue is caused when an application builds a path to executable code using an attacker-controlled variable in a way that allows the attacker to control which file is executed at run time. A file include vulnerability is distinct from a generic directory traversal attack, in that directory traversal is a way of gaining unauthorized file system access, and a file inclusion vulnerability subverts how an application loads code for execution. Successful exploitation of a file inclusion vulnerability will result in remote code execution on the web server that runs the affected web application. An attacker can use remote code execution to create a web shell on the web server, which can be used for website defacement.

[[V(D)J recombination]]

CATEGORIES: Immunology, Blood cells

V(D)J is the basis of the vertebrate immune system. It makes antibodies.

All vertebrates have an adaptive immune system. This protects them against many infections and diseases caused by viruses and bacteria. V(D)J is the basic mechanism. The work is done by developing lymphocytes (B cells and T cells). They make the immune system adaptive. What this means is that the body is able to defend against many infections it has never met before, and the defence gets better against repeat attacks from the same agent. 

The details are very complex. The system makes sequences of amino acids which bind on to the corresponding sequences of infective agents. The system also recognises  "altered self cells" as seen in cancer.

Of course all systems have limits, so when the system fails to recognise a pathogen or cancer, we suffer the consequences.

In 1987 Susumu Tonegawa was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine "for his discovery of the genetic principle for generation of antibody diversity".

The V(D)J refers to the way variable, joining and sometimes diversity regions are produced in the white blood cells. The cells are made in the bone marrow and thymus of vertebrates.
