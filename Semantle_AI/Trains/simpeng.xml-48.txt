A "staight line" is different though: It is the shortest path between two points, which stays on the surface of the plane. Some theorems of Euclidean geometry cannot be used on the sphere, many of them have been adapted though.

[[Jo-Jo the Dog-Faced Boy]]

CATEGORIES: 1868 births, 1904 deaths, Deaths from pneumonia, People from Saint Petersburg, Russian entertainers, Sideshow performers

Fedor Jeftichew, better known as Jo-Jo the Dog-Faced Boy (1868 - January 31, 1904) was a Russian sideshow performer. Like his father, Adrien, with whom he performed, Jo-Jo was afflicted with hypertrichosis, an abnormal growth of hair over the face and body. Jo-Jo was covered with long, silky hair and was said to resemble a Skye terrier.

Jo-Jo was born in St Petersburg, Russia in 1868. He began touring Europe in 1873. He was five feet eight inches tall, had only four or five teeth, and spoke Russian, German, and a little English. He dressed like a Russian cavalryman. He would bark at an audience, and would perform as often as 23 times a day. In 1886, he was making US$500 a week.

Jo-Jo toured Europe and Russia, playing in fairgrounds. He was discovered by Charles Reynolds in London, England. Jo-Jo was performing with his father, Adrien, who resembled a poodle. Reynolds realized the Dog-Faced Boy could be presented in a more professional manner. He took the boy to the United States on the City of Chicago on 12 October 1884.

A press conference was called. Journalists were allowed to pull Jeftichew's hair to be assured it was real and not pasted on. The New York Herald described Jeftichew as "the most extraordinary and absorbingly interesting curiosity that has ever reached these shores."

In 1884, Jeftichew signed with P. T. Barnum. Barnum stated (falsely) that Jo-Jo was captured by a hunter in the wilds of central Russia. Barnum advertised him as "the most prodigious paragon of all prodigies secured by P. T. Barnum in fifty years. The Human Skye Terrier, the crowning mystery of nature's contradictions."

He toured Europe with Barnum and Bailey's Greatest Show on Earth in 1901 and 1902. He died in Greece in 1904 while on tour of pneumonia. He was the subject of a song recorded by Annette Funicello in the 1960s and was a character in an episode of the television series, Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

[[Sample]]

CATEGORIES: Statistics

In statistics, a sample is part of a population. The sample is carefully chosen. It should represent the whole population fairly, without bias.

The reason samples are needed is that populations may be so large that counting all the individuals may not be possible or practical. Therefore, solving a problem in statistics usually starts with sampling. Sampling is about choosing which data to take for later analysis. As an example, suppose the pollution of a lake should be analysed for a study. Depending on where the samples of water were taken, the studies can have different results. 

As a general rule, samples need to be random. This means the chance or probability of selecting one individual is the same as the chance of selecting any other individual.

In practice, random samples are always taken by means of a well-defined procedure. A procedure is a set of rules, a sequence of steps written down and exactly followed. Even so, some bias may remain in the sample. Consider the problem of designing a sample to predict the result of an election poll. All known methods have their problems, and the results of an election are often different from predictions based on a sample. If you collect opinions by using telephones, or by meeting people in the street, you won't ask people who don't answer phone calls or who don't walk on the street. Therefore, in cases like this a completely neutral sample is never possible. In such cases a statistician will think about how to measure the amount of bias, and there are ways to estimate this.

A similar situation occurs when scientists measure a physical property, say the weight of a piece of metal, or the speed of light. If we weigh an object with sensitive equipment we will get minutely different results. No system of measurement is ever perfect. We get a series of estimates, each one being a measurement. These are samples, with a certain degree of error. Statistics is designed to describe error, and carry out analysis on this kind of data.

There are different kinds of samples:

The way the sampling is obtained, along with the sample size, will have an impact on how the data is viewed.

[[The Well-Tempered Clavier]]

CATEGORIES: Compositions by Johann Sebastian Bach

The Well-Tempered Clavier (also known as WTC, BWV 846–893) is the title of two collections of musical works for solo keyboard instruments by the Baroque composer Johann Sebastian Bach. The first collection was written in 1722 and the second was written in 1742, but they were not published until 1801, fifty years after Bach died. Although the music was written for the harpsichord, which was popular at the time, today it is usually played and heard on a piano.

Both collections have 24 short preludes and 24 fugues to go along with it. All of them contrast with each other: some of them are easy to learn, while others are hard to follow (because there are many different melodies going on at the same time, which is called counterpoint). What is special about them is that each prelude and fugue is written in a different major or minor key. They appear in the book so that they go up by semitones. That is, the first prelude and fugue is in C major, the second is in C minor, the third in C-sharp major (or D-flat major), the fourth in C-sharp minor, and so on, until the last two preludes and fugues are in B major and B minor, in that order.

Other composers would later write music that is also in all 24 major and minor keys. The best known of these are the Preludes by Frédéric Chopin, but this would also later be done by Charles-Valentin Alkan, Sergei Rachmaninoff, and Dmitri Shostakovich, to name a few.

Some of the music that appears in The Well-Tempered Clavier has become famous. For example, the French Romantic composer Charles Gounod wrote a setting of Ave Maria that is based on the melody of the first Prelude in C Major in the WTC.

[[Frequency response]]

CATEGORIES: Sound

Systems respond differently to inputs of different frequencies. Some systems may amplify frequencies of certain range and attenuate the other frequencies. The way that the system output is related to the input for different frequencies is called frequency response. Frequency response means a graph where can be seen how something changes in different sound frequency. It is typically used in loudspeakers. Also audio crossovers way to function can be shown with frequency response.

The frequency response will be represented by two numbers and measured in Hertz (Hz) which is the unit of measurement for one frequency cycle. The first number represents the lowest bass frequency while the second number indicates the highest high-frequency an audio product can produce.

[[Audio crossover]]

CATEGORIES: Sound, Electronic circuits

Audio crossover is an electric circuit that separates low and high audio frequencies in a signal. It is needed because very small loudspeakers (tweeters) would break if fed by low frequencies. Likewise, bigger speakers (subwoofers) are not able to play higher frequencies purely.

Audio crossovers are divided to passive or active crossovers. Typical components used with passive crossovers are capacitors inductors and resistors.  If passive crossover uses resistors to adjust loudness, those generate heat. Instead, active devices typically use resistors and capacitors with other audioelectronic components and those typically don't consume so much electric power. Also, active crossovers are easily built to be adjustable. Still, that doesn't mean that using passive crossover means low quality.

The Boulton Paul Defiant was a British fighter aircraft. This single-engine,  aircraft first in August 1937 and was used by the British Royal Air Force in World War II. 

Defiants were different to other fighter planes because their guns (four Machine guns) were in a rotating turret and could fire in any direction. They had two crew: one man was the pilot and the other aimed the guns.

Defiants were made to shoot down enemy bomber aircraft. When they were used during the Battle of Britain, they were good at this. But they were slower and could not turn as well as German fighter planes, like the Messerschmitt Bf 109. A lot of Defiants were shot down by German fighters.

After the Battle of Britain, the British only flew Defiants at night. In this way they could attack the German bombers that also flew at night, and avoid the German fighters because they only flew during the day. 

Today, only one Defiant is left in the world; it is in a museum in London.

Shemini Atzeret (שְׁמִינִי עֲצֶרֶת – "the Eighth day of Assembly") is a Jewish holiday of the (Northern Hemisphere) autumn. In Israel, the date of the holiday is 22 Tishrei on the Hebrew calendar. Outside of Israel, it is two days long, on 22-23 Tishrei. On the Gregorian calendar, Shemini Atzeret comes in late September or early or middle October.

The holiday is best known for the celebration of Simchat Torah (שִׂמְחֵת תּוֹרָה), "Rejoicing of the Torah", when Jews finish the annual cycle of reading the whole Torah out loud in synagogue. Outside Israel, Simchat Torah is celebrated on the second day of the holiday. Most people outside Israel use the name Shemini Atzeret for the first day only. They call the second day Simchat Torah because of this celebration. In Israel, the one day of the holiday is called by both names.

In some ways, this holiday is part of the holiday of Sukkot. The shemini ("8th") is the 8th day of Sukkot. In other ways, this holiday is a separate holiday on its own, and not part of Sukkot. 

Shemini Atzeret is an important Jewish holiday. Like on Shabbat and other important Jewish holidays, work is not allowed on Shemini Atzeret.

[[Lateral line]]

CATEGORIES: Fish, Sensory system

The lateral line is a system of sense organs found in fish, and not in land vertebrates. It detects movement and vibration in the surrounding water. Modified epithelial cells, known as hair cells, respond to changes around the fish. These  turn the changes into electrical impulses which go to their central nervous system. 

Lateral lines are used in schooling, predation, and orientation. For example, fish use their lateral line system to follow the vortices produced by fleeing prey. They are faint lines running lengthwise down each side, from the gill covers to the base of the tail. 

In some species, the receptive organs of the lateral line have been modified to function as electroreceptors, which are organs used to detect electrical impulses. Most amphibian larvae and some fully aquatic adult amphibians have systems which work a bit like the lateral line.

It was in the dictionaries and lawbooks as long as there had been dictionaries and lawbooks. It was an ordinary, hardworking, nondescript word that was used to refer to a process, any process of justice of governance, being conducted in the open".

The Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte was signed in the autumn of 911. It was a treaty between Charles the Simple and Rollo, one of the leaders of the Vikings living in Neustria. It was to protect Charles' kingdom from any new invasion by the "Northmen. In 911, a group of Vikings lead by Rollo besieged Paris and Chartres. After a victory near Chartres on 26 August, Charles decided to try to reach an agreement with Rollo. The talks were led by Hervé, the Archbishop of Reims. The result was the Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte. The treaty granted Rollo all land between the river Epte and the sea in exchange for his fealty. In addition, the treaty granted Rollo Brittany "for his livelihood". At the time, Brittany was an independent region which France had not been able to control. In exchange, Rollo promised the king his loyalty, which involved military assistance for the protection of the kingdom. As a token of his good will, Rollo also agreed to be baptised and marry Gisela a daughter of king Charles.

The territory covered by the treaty is nearly the same as today’s Upper Normandy down to the Seine river. It would later extend west beyond the Seine to form the Duchy of Normandy, named for the northmen who ruled it. The treaty was entered into after the death of Alan I, King of Brittany and at the time another group of Vikings occupied Brittany. Around 937 Alan I's son, Alan II returned from England to expel those Vikings from Brittany. This happened in 939. During this period the Cotentin Peninsula was lost by Brittany and gained by Normandy.

This group should not be confused with the Australian Labor Party (Non-Communist), which was a name used by supporters of New South Wales Premier Jack Lang in the 1930s.

The Australian Labor Party (Anti-Communist) (ALP-AC) was the name used by the right-wing group which split away from the Australian Labor Party in 1955. It later became the Democratic Labor Party in 1957.

In April 1955, seven Victorian federal MPs and eighteen state Members of Parliament were expelled from the ALP. They formed the ALP-AC under the influence of B. A. Santamaria. Only one state MP was elected at the next elections, while five Legislative Council members were not re-elected when their terms expired in 1958. The seven federal MPs were:

Frank McManus was elected to the Senate for Victoria and former ALP senator George Cole was re-elected to the Senate for Tasmania.  Later Frank Scully gained the seat of Richmond in the Victorian Legislative Assembly in the May 1955 Victorian election.

The members of the ALP (Anti-Communist) were mostly Roman Catholic. There were only two non-Catholics, its federal leader, Bob Joshua, who represented Ballarat in the Australian House of Representatives, and Jack Little, who led the party in the Victoria Legislative Council between 1955 and 1958.

The party attracted many voters among migrants from Catholic countries in southern Europe, and among anti-Communist Eastern European refugees. In 1957, the party became the Democratic Labor Party, which closed in 1978.

CATEGORIES: History of France, Geography of France, History of England

Anjou (ɑ̃ʒu) is a former county, duchy (1360) and province centred on the city of Angers in the lower Loire Valley of western France.  Its traditional Latin name was Andegavia.

Anjou, or then the Angevin march (border lands) formed the border between Neustria and Aquitaine.  It also bordered between Neustria and Brittany. Sitting on a black slate rock was the Roman fortress of Angers. It guarded the rivers Mayenne and Loire that flowed around it.

The founder or first count of Anjou was Ingelger.

Anjou became a part of England from 1151-1199, when Henry II inherited the county. He became the Count of Anjou in addition to his other titles. His (third) son Richard the Lionheart became count after his father. At the peak of its power the Angevin Empire spread from Ulster to the Pyrenees. Richard had no legitimate issue, so in 1199 Anjou passed to his nephew, Arthur of Brittany. He was the son of Geoffrey, Duke of Brittany. The Crown of England passed to Henry II’s fifth son and Richard’s youngest brother, John.  Arthur was taken prisoner by King John in 1203 and was never seen again.  In 1204, Anjou was taken back by Philip II of France. It was later elevated to a duchy for Prince Louis, the second son of John II of France. It remained a duchy until the French Revolution.  Today, Anjou corresponds largely to the present-day département of Maine-et-Loire.

[[Linear independence]]

CATEGORIES: Linear algebra

Linear independence is a concept from linear algebra. It is used to talk about vector spaces. Each vector space has a null vector. This vector is expressed as a linear combination (a sum) of other vectors. A set of these vectors is called linearly independent if and only if all of them are needed to express this null vector. This is equivalent to saying that at least one of the vectors can be expressed as a linear combination of the others. If the vectors are not linearly independent, they are called linearly dependent.

As an example, take the three-dimensional Euclidean space:

Here the first three vectors are linearly independent; but the fourth vector equals nine times the first plus five times the second plus four times the third, so the four vectors together are linearly dependent. Linear dependence is a property of the family, not of any particular vector; for example in this case we could just as well write the first vector as a linear combination of the last three.

[[Castor and Pollux]]

CATEGORIES: People in Greek mythology, Roman mythology

Castor and Pollux were twin brothers in Greek and Roman mythology.  Together they are called the Dioscuri.  They were the sons of Queen Leda of Sparta.  Their twin sisters were Helen of Troy and Clytemnestra.  Castor and Pollux were changed into the constellation called Gemini.  Tyndareus, the king of Sparta, was the father of Castor, which made Castor mortal, while Zeus was the father of Pollux which made him a demigod.

Zeus seduced Leda as a swan and she laid four eggs, these eggs hatched and four children were born to Leda, the two brothers Castor and Pollux, and two sisters, Helen and Clytemnestra; Castor and Clytemnestra were considered to be the children of King Tyndareus,  Pollux and Helen were the demigod offspring of Zeus.

Castor and Pollux are universally named among the Argonauts, the crew of the Argo who sailed for Colchis with Jason.  During the quest for the Golden Fleece, Pollux is noted for having bested the King of Bebryces during a boxing match.

One of the best-known myths with Castor and Pollux is how they became a constellation.        During a battle Castor, being mortal was killed. Heartbroken at the death of his brother, Pollux prayed to Zeus to make Castor immortal which meant Pollux would have to give up half of his immortality.  Eventually, Zeus agreed to the request, and so Castor and Pollux were transformed into the Gemini constellation.  To balance the cosmos, the Dioscuri would only be on Olympus one half of the year, and the other six months would be spent in the Underworld in the Elysium fields.

They became the gods of sailing and horsemanship. ... Pollux and Castor were also known for their boxing abilities and were thus the gods of athletes and athletic competitions. In both art and literature, Pollux and his brother were shown with horses, as the two were famed horsemen.

[[Land reclamation]]

CATEGORIES: Geography

Land reclamation is the idea of getting new land. It is usually done in coastal areas. Sometimes it is also done in areas like rivers and lakes. Usually, there is a natural process which fills such areas with sand, dirt and other materials. Land reclamation uses the same process, which is sped up. In many cases, this is done using dikes. An example where land reclamation is done is the IJsselmeer in the Netherlands.

Pioneer plants, such as Salicornia or Ammophila grow there. When the level of the land is as high as that of the high tide, new ditches are dug, and the process can repeat.

Sometimes, it is too time-consuming to wait for the land to rise. In that case, it is possible to pump out the water in the enclosed area. This was done in the Netherlands, where many areas are below sea level. The problem with this approach is that it needs to be repeated, for example in the case of heavy rainfall.

Few examples are Kansai Airport in Osaka, Japan.

The creation of large, artificial islands, such as Palm Islands in Dubai or Maasvlakte, which is part of the port of Rotterdam is not known as Land reclamation.

[[Russell's paradox]]

CATEGORIES: Logical paradoxes, Set theory

Russell's Paradox is the theory that states: If you have a list of lists that do not list themselves, then that list must list itself, because it doesn't contain itself. However, if it lists itself, it then contains itself, meaning it cannot list itself. This makes logical usages of lists of lists that don't contain themselves somewhat difficult.

[[Exogeny]]

CATEGORIES: Earth sciences

Exogeny refers to coming from the outside. People, planets, computers, and anything else can be influenced either by things in its environment or by things within itself. Things from within itself are indigenous.

The Earth is shaped by many geological processes. The forces that make these things happen come from both inside and outside the Earth.

In geology, exogenous processes come from forces on or above the Earth's surface. Processes caused by forces from within the Earth are endogenous processes. Exo is a prefix meaning "out", and endo is a prefix meaning "in".

Many exogenous (extraterrestrial) forces are caused by other bodies in the Solar System. For example, the Moon causes tides in the Earth's oceans and other big bodies of water. Impacts from comets and meteoroids change the surface of the Earth. When they strike the Earth, they make craters in the ground.

The Sun is the main exogenous influence in the Solar System. It has many effects on Earth. Radiation from the Sun is a main cause of the surface temperature of the Earth, and for the growth of plant life. We are partly shielded from the Sun's solar wind by the Earth's magnetic field. Storms of solar particles would otherwise strip away the ozone layer which protects us from ultraviolet radiation. Sometimes we see aurorae, which are lights that can be seen at night near the poles.

An example of an exogenous process that is not as a result of bodies in space is erosion. Erosion is mostly made by precipitation such as rain and snow, and by wind. 

There are three main endogenous geological processes: folding, faulting and volcanism. They take place mainly along the plate boundaries. These are the zones on the edges of plates. Endogenous processes cause many major landform features.

[[Tonic immobility]]

CATEGORIES: Zoology, Ethology

Tonic immobility is a natural state of paralysis that animals enter, often called animal hypnosis. Its function is not certain. It may be related to mating in certain animals like sharks. It may also be a way of avoiding or deterring predators (playing dead is called thanatosis).

Tonic immobility has also been used for the paralysis that often immobilizes animals, such as rodents or birds, when they feel threatened by a predator. Tonic immobility plays a role in survival if it helps a hunted animal to blend in with its surroundings. 

Tonic immobility can be induced without causing any apparent stress to the animal. For example, stroking a particular area of a lobster's shell or focusing a hen's attention on a line on the ground.

Tonic immobility has also been said to occur in humans that are subject to intense trauma, such as rape or sexual assault. Catatonia in humans is a serious psychiatric condition that often involves a state of immobility.

[[Triangular trade]]

CATEGORIES: Atlantic Ocean, History of colonialism, Trade, Economic history, Historic slave trade

The triangular trade refers to trade between three ports or regions. Triangular trade usually develops when a region is exporting resources that are not needed in the region from which its main imports come. Instead, the resources are exported to a third region. The routes involved were historically also shaped by the winds and currents during the age of sailing ships.

The best-known triangular trading systems were across the Atlantic Ocean, especially the Atlantic slave trade, which lasted from the late 16th to early 19th centuries. During this time, European countries such as Britain, Spain and France had colonies in the Americas and Africa. The ships carrying slaves, crops and manufactured goods between West Africa, the Caribbean and American colonies and the colonial powers in Europe. The use of African slaves was very important to growing colonial cash crops, which were exported to Europe. European goods, in turn, were used to buy African slaves, which were then brought west from Africa to the Americas to work on the crops. The middle passage of the triangular trade refers to the transportation of the slaves to America.

The Atlantic economy was tied into the idea of mercantilism, which thought it was a good idea for European countries to have a lot of colonies that traded only with them. Goods that were traded in the Atlantic economy were rum, slaves, sugar, tobacco, gold, spices, fish, lumber and manufactured goods. Triangular trading became less common in the 20th century due to free trade and ships specialized for particular cargoes.

This was the beginning of modern astronomy.

Before Copernicus, most people thought that the Sun and the other planets revolved around the Earth (this was called geocentrism). This is because if you stand on Earth, it looks like the Sun and stars are moving across the sky. However, when people watched for many years they saw many things that did not make sense if the Earth was the center of the Solar system. For example, sometimes the planets seemed to move back and forth instead of moving around the Earth. Copernicus explained why these things happen in 1543, when he published the book De revolutionibus orbium coelestium ("On the revolutions of the heavenly spheres"). This gave his reasons for thinking the Sun was at the center instead.

Other astronomers who made further advances after Copernicus were Johannes Kepler and Galileo Galilei. For example, Kepler showed that the planets do not orbit in perfect circles, and Galileo built very good telescopes that helped to confirm the heliocentric model.

Copernicus also thought that the sun was the center of the universe, but we now know that this is incorrect. The Sun is part of the Milky Way galaxy which is one out of billions of galaxies.

[[Trance]]

CATEGORIES: Psychology, Words

Trance describes a state of mind. A trance is when a person is conscious, and not sleeping, but is unaware of what is happening around him or her.

The term trance is associated with hypnosis, meditation, magic, flow, religion, and certain kinds of music. It is an "altered state of consciousness".

There are many efforts to define what a trance is. Some think it is a borderland between normal consciousness and spirituality

The most straightforward example is when a person is hypnotized, they are in a trance. Conscious, and responding to the hypnotist, the person seems to block out other thoughts and other information.

Another common example is the day-dream, where a person's mind drifts across private thoughts. Everyone daydreams, but young children constantly daydream, and have vivid imaginary fantasies. This is entirely normal. In the language of psychology, this kind of temporary separation from one's surroundings is called "dissociation". Research shows that a lot is going on when we daydream.

There are many examples of trance in religion. African animistic religions, such as that of the Yoruba, feature dances in celebration of the spirits. Under the influence of rhythm and song, a group dances, often for hours at a time. During this time, various members of the group may fall into trances, and some may act as if possessed by one of the spirits being worshiped. States of "spiritual ecstasy" are known in most forms of Christian worship. It is a main part of those aspects of religion known as "mysticism".

[[Spitzer Space Telescope]]

CATEGORIES: Space telescopes

The Spitzer Space Telescope is a telescope launched into space by NASA in 2003. It is the fourth telescope in the Great Observatories program (the Hubble Space Telescope was the first). The Hubble Space Telescope takes pictures of visible light, and the Spitzer Space Telescope takes pictures of infrared light. Unlike Hubble, Spitzer orbits the Sun instead of the Earth.

[[Nominative case]]

CATEGORIES: Grammar

In grammar, the nominative case is the grammatical case used when talking about the subject of the sentence. For example, "the boy kissed the girl."

[[Genitive case]]

CATEGORIES: Grammar

[[NuSTAR]]

CATEGORIES: Space telescopes

NuSTAR is a telescope launched into space by NASA in 2012. It is the eleventh satellite in the "Small Explorer" program. Telescopes in space can see much better than on Earth, because the telescopes on Earth need to look through the atmosphere. 

NuSTAR measures high-energy X-rays, which have a much higher frequency than visible light. It uses special optical devices to do this, so it works differently from a normal telescope. This type of telescope is called a Wolter telescope.

NuSTAR is searching for black holes. It is also looking at supernovae to help understand how the chemical elements are created. One of the first discoveries made by NuSTAR, along with another space telescope called XMM-Newton, was to measure the spin rate of a supermassive black hole for the first time.

[[Carmelo Flores Laura]]

CATEGORIES: 1906 births, 2014 deaths, Bolivian people, Centenarians, Longevity claims

Carmelo Flores Laura (likely born July 16, 1906 – June 9, 2014) was a centenarian from Bolivia, who some believed to be born in 1890. That would have made him the person living to be the oldest ever known. However, other documents was found, that indicated he was actually born in 1906. Flores himself only said that he was about 100 years or more, which in that case  was correct.

Laura was born on July 16, 1906 in Bolivia.   

Carmelo Flores Laura worked for the rancher who owned Frasquia, a rural area of Bolivia near Lake Titicaca, until 1952. At that time, the government seized the land and redistributed it to peasants such as Flores. He has lived there since, never traveling father than La Paz, 80 from his home.

Flores had three children, one of which is alive as of 2013 (Cecilio, aged 67). He has 40 grandchildren and 19 great-grandchildren. His wife died in the 2000s. 

The Bolivian government was said to be planning to officially honor Flores as "a living heritage" of the Bolivian people.

A police ID card and entry in the civil registry stating Flores was born on July 16, 1890 were shown to reporters. The longest fully documented lifespan in history is 122 years and 164 days, achieved by France's Jeanne Calment.  

Flores himself only said "I should be about 100 years old or more," when asked about his age. The Gerontology Research Group found a baptismal certificate that indicated Flores was actually 107 years rather than 123.

Laura died in an Andean village in Bolivia, aged 107.

[[Darwin's finches]]

CATEGORIES: Evolution, Passeriformes, Charles Darwin

Darwin's finches, also known as the Galapagos finches, are a group of birds that live on the Galápagos Islands. They are not actually finches, but they are a kind of passerine bird.

Charles Darwin used the finches to provide evidence for natural selection. He realized that the finches have different beaks because they are adapted to eat different kinds of food. For example, a finch with a big beak is very good at cracking open nuts, and a finch with a long beak is very good at catching insects. Darwin was able to see that the finches had a common ancestor which is why they were so similar except for their beaks. Eventually, this led to the theory of evolution.

[[Pico do Fogo]]

CATEGORIES: Volcanoes of Africa, Geography of Cape Verde

Pico do Fogo ("Fire peak") is the highest peak of Cape Verde, rising to 2829 above sea level. It is an active stratovolcano lying on the island of Fogo. The last eruption of the main volcanic cone was in 1675 and all the people living in the island had to leave.

A lateral vent (the opening of a volcano from which lava flows) erupted in 1995. The only deadly eruption was in 1847 when earthquakes produced in all the island claimed several lives. Volcanic lava has reached the eastern coast of the island in historical times.

Its most spectacular feature is a volcanic crater (or caldera, caldeira in Portuguese) that is about 9 wide, with a border (bordeira in Portuguese) that is about 1 high. The crater has a slit in its eastern wall, and a large peak like a volcanic cone rises in its center that. The central cone is the highest point of the island (2829 m) and its peak is about 100 m higher than the bordeira that surrounds the crater.

The lowest elevation of the floor of the caldeira, known as Chã das Caldeiras ("Plain of the Calderas") is 1625. There are, within the caldeira, two villages which were evacuated during the last eruption. Traditionally, grapes are grown on the inner slopes of the bordeira and there is some subsistence agriculture on the caldeira floor.

The mountain's slopes are used to grow coffee, while its lava is used as building material.

The Fea's petrel (Pterodroma feae), a Near Threatened species of bird, breeds in this mountain.

The endemic plants Echium vulcanorum and Erysimum caboverdeanum are only known to occur on the outer rim of the volcano.

[[Harmonic analysis]]

CATEGORIES: Digital signal processing, Mathematical analysis

Harmonic analysis is a branch of mathematics that looks at the theoretical foundations of digital signal processing. A continuous signal can be drawn as a wave, or as a combination of several waves. Fourier transforms and Fourier series are among the main tools used for signal analysis. Today, this field has many uses, which also include quantum mechanics and neuroscience. 

In essence, harmonic analysis looks at locally compact groups. The Lebesgue measure is a way to assign a measurement to a subset of the Euclidean space. For real numbers there is the Haar measure, which can perform this task. This measure allows to use Fourier analysis to model the groups and their properties. 

The term harmonics is also related to Eigenvalues, in the case where the frequency of one wave is an integer multiple of the frequency of another wave. This is the case of the harmonics that are used for musical notes. Later the term was generalized.

[[Coptic language]]

CATEGORIES: Afroasiatic languages, Egypt, 17th-century disestablishments

Coptic or Coptic Egyptian is an Egyptian language. It was spoken by many people in Egypt until at least the 17th century. Now, only a few people speak the language.

Egyptian began to be written using the Greek alphabet in the 1st century. The new writing system became the Coptic script, an adapted Greek alphabet with the addition of six or seven signs from the demotic script to represent Egyptian sounds the Greek language did not have. The two most common dialects are Sahidic and Bohairic.

Coptic and demotic Egyptian are very similar to the earlier Egyptian language written in the hieroglyphic script. Coptic flourished as a literary language from the 2nd to 13th centuries, and its Bohairic dialect continues to be the liturgical language of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria. It was supplanted by Egyptian Arabic as a spoken language toward the early modern period. The Copts have tried to revive the language since the 19th century.

[[Gyrocompass]]

CATEGORIES: Navigation, Tools

A gyrocompass is a type of compass that does not use magnetism to point north. Normal compasses do not work around magnets, or big pieces of ferrous metal. Gyrocompasses do. This makes them very useful.

A gyrocompass is a non-magnetic compass based on a fast-spinning disc and the rotation of the Earth  It automatically finds geographical direction. 

Although one part of a gyrocompass is a gyroscope, these are not the same devices. A crucial ingredient is needed to turn a gyroscope into a gyrocompass, so it would automatically position to true north. This is some mechanism that applies torque whenever the compass's axis is not pointing north. Successful methods have two significant advantages over magnetic compasses:

[[Mixed forest]]

CATEGORIES: Forests, Biomes

Mixed forests  are a temperate and humid biome. The forests have four layers. The uppermost layer is the forest canopy of tall, mature trees from 33 to 66 m (100 to 200 feet) high. 

Below the canopy is the three-layered understory, about 9 to 15 m (30 to 50 feet) shorter than the canopy. The top layer of the understory has smaller mature trees, saplings. There are also suppressed juvenile canopy layer trees waiting for an opening in the canopy. Below the sub-canopy is the shrub layer of low-growing woody plants. Most of the time, the lowest growing (and most diverse) layer is the ground cover or herbaceous layer.

[[Ancient woodland]]

CATEGORIES: Forests of the United Kingdom, England

Ancient woodland is the name used in the United Kingdom for woodland which has existed continuously since 1600 or before in England and Wales (or 1750 in Scotland). Before those dates, planting of new woodland was uncommon, so a wood present in 1600 was likely to have developed naturally. The American name for these forests is "old growth forest".

For many species of animal and plant, ancient woodland sites provide the only habitat. For many others, conditions on these sites are much more suitable than those on other sites. Ancient woodland in the UK, like rainforest in the tropics, is home to rare and threatened species, more than any other UK habitat. For these reasons ancient woodland is often described as an irreplaceable resource, or 'critical natural capital'.

Ancient woodland is formally defined on maps by Natural England and equivalent bodies. Many ancient woodlands have legal protection, but an ancient woodland is not automatically protected. 

[[Bluebell wood]]

CATEGORIES: Forests of Europe, Flowers

A bluebell wood is a woodland that in springtime has a carpet of flowering bluebells (Hyacinthoides non-scripta) underneath a newly forming leaf canopy. The thicker the summer canopy, the more the ground-cover is suppressed. This encourages a dense carpet of bluebells, whose leaves mature and die down by early summer.

Bluebell woods may be found in all parts of Great Britain and Ireland, as well as elsewhere in Europe. Bluebells are a common indicator species for ancient woodlands, so bluebell woods are likely to date back to at least 1600.

Gerard Manley Hopkins, one of the romantic poets, was very keen on bluebells, as his poem "May Magnificat" shows.

And azuring-over greybell makes

[[Oh! Susanna]]

CATEGORIES: 19th century American songs, Compositions by Stephen Foster

"Oh! Susanna" is a song by Stephen Foster. It was Foster's first hit song. The song debuted in the Eagle Ice Cream Saloon in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on September 11, 1847 and was published by W. C. Peters of Cincinnati, Ohio in 1848.  It became the unofficial anthem of the California Gold Rush in 1849.

Foster had little appreciation of the worth of his songs. His brother Morrison wrote: "While in Cincinnati Stephen wrote "Oh, Susanna", a song which soon became famous ... There was then in Cincinnati in the music business, W. C. Peters, whom Stephen had known in Pittsburgh, and who had taught music in our family ... Stephen made a present of "Old Uncle Ned" and "Oh, Susanna" to Mr. Peters. The latter made ten thousand dollars out of them, and established a music publishing house which became the largest in the West. The fame of these two songs went around the world, and thousands sang and played them who never heard the name of the author or whence they came."

[[Beautiful Dreamer]]

CATEGORIES: 19th century American songs, Compositions by Stephen Foster

"Beautiful Dreamer" is a song by Stephen Foster written about 1862. It was first published (posthumously) in 1864 by William A. Pond & Co. It has been promoted as Foster's last song, but that distinction cannot be confirmed. It is similar in some respects to his first published song, "Open They Lattice, Love". Both have a triple rhythm and share imagery of the sea and marine life. 

The arpeggiated accompaniment recalls bel canto opera. The dreamer in this song is either asleep or dead. The song does not distinguish. It is a song though about dissolution  of melting, of dissolving, of vanishing into mists, and, finally into death. The song is not held in the highest esteem by some musicologists and has been described by one as "saccharine" and "smacking somewhat of the idiom of Irving Berlin."

[[Box-Ironbark forest]]

CATEGORIES: Ecosystems, Geography of Victoria, Australia, Forests of Australia

Box-Ironbark forest is a forest or woodland ecosystem found in central Victoria in south-eastern Australia. It is named after the Box and Ironbark trees which grow in the forest.

CATEGORIES: Trees of Australia, Eucalyptus

Ironbark is a common name of a number of species within the genus Eucalyptus that have dark, deeply furrowed bark.

Many eucalypts shed their bark very year, but on an Ironbark the dead bark stays on the trees, forming the furrows. It becomes rough after drying out and becomes full of kino, a dark red tree sap exuded by the tree. The bark is resistant to fire and heat and protects the living tissue within the trunk and branches from fire. In cases of extreme fire, where leaves and shoots are removed, the bark protects the epicormic buds which allow the tree to reshoot.

There have been 130 different birds seen in the forest. Animals include kangaroos, wallabies, echidna, koalas and possums. In 1954, 160 koalas were set free in the forest to as part of a plan to re-establish the animals in Victorian forests. In the 19th century, deer were introduced and Sambar deer are still living in the wet gullies in the south of the forest.

Activities in the forest include camping, walking, four wheel driving, horse riding, and bird watching.

The purpose of the forest is to supply good quality hardwood logs for sawmills. The management plan for the forest also protects the water catchments of several creeks which supply water to nearby towns.

[[Royal forest]]

CATEGORIES: Forests of Europe, History of Europe

A royal forest is an area of land with various meanings, but basically it is woodland once owned by monarchs.  

In Anglo-Saxon England, the kings were great huntsmen but they never set aside areas forbidden to other users.  Historians find no evidence of the Anglo-Saxon monarchs (c.500 to 1066) creating forests. 

However, under the Norman kings (after 1066), no hunting was allowed on Royal lands except by authority of the King. The law was designed to protect the venison and the vert, the "noble" animals of the chase – notably red and fallow deer, the roe, and the wild boar – and the greenery which sustained them. 

Royal forests were designed as hunting areas reserved for the monarch or (by invitation) the aristocracy. The concept was introduced by the Normans to England in the 11th century, and in the late 12th and early 13th centuries, one-third of the land area of southern England was designated as royal forest. At one stage in the 12th century, all of Essex was afforested, and on his accession Henry II declared all of Huntingdonshire to be royal forest.

Afforestation, in particular the creation of the New Forest, figured large in the folk history of the "Norman Yoke": 

Forest law prescribed harsh punishment for anyone who committed any offence within the forests. Killing game was a capital offence. By the mid-17th century, enforcement of this law died out, but many English woodlands still bear the title Royal Forest. The practice of reserving areas of land for the sole use of the aristocracy was common throughout Europe during the mediaeval period. 

Royal forests usually included large areas of heath, grassland and wetland – anywhere that supported deer and other game. In addition, when an area was designated forest, any villages, towns and fields that lay within it were also subject to forest law. Local inhabitants were restricted in the use of land they had previously relied on for their livelihood. However, common rights were not extinguished, but merely restricted.

Charnwood Forest is an area in north-western Leicestershire, England, near Leicester, Loughborough, and Coalville.

Although called a forest, it is extremely varied, with many different areas. It has 45 sites of geological or wildlife interest. Above all, it is the only site in Europe where the Ediacaran fossil Charnia is found.

The area has some extensive tracts of woodland. It is undulating, rocky and picturesque, with barren areas. It is generally 600 ft (180 m) and upwards. On its western side is an abandoned coalfield, with Coalville and other former mining villages. This is now being regenerated and replanted as part of the National Forest. The M1 motorway cuts through Charnwood Forest.

The hard stone of Charnwood Forest has been quarried for centuries, and was a source of grind-stones. The granite quarries are of national importance and supply crushed stone ("aggregate") to much of southern Britain.

Charnwood Forest includes a National Nature Reserve (NNR), 19 SSSIs, four geological conservation sites of international importance, and another six conservation sites, 13 Regionally Important Geological Sites (RIGS), five local nature reserves (LNRs), and seven Leicestershire and Rutland Wildlife Trust (LRWT) nature reserves.

[[Oil sands]]

CATEGORIES: Geology, Oils

Oil sands, or tar sands are an unconventional source of petroleum. The oil sands are a mixture of sand, clay and water together with a dense and extremely sticky form of petroleum referred to as bitumen.

Natural bitumen is found in many countries, with the largest quantities in Canada, Kazakhstan and Russia. The estimated worldwide deposits are more than 2 trillion barrels (320 billion cubic metres). These estimates include deposits that have not yet been discovered. Around 70% of all proven reserves are in Canada.

Oil produced from bitumen sands is often referred to as unconventional oil, to separate it from traditional liquid oil. The production process is very energy consuming so that the net energy gain is much smaller compared to traditional oil. Making liquid fuels from oil sands requires much energy and produces 12 percent more greenhouse gases per barrel of final product than production of traditional oil. Therefore oil sands have only recently been considered to be part of the world's oil reserves. Higher oil prices now allow for profitable extraction and processing.

[[Hepburn Regional Park]]

CATEGORIES: Protected areas of Victoria (Australia), Forests of Australia

The Hepburn Regional Park is a large bush and forest park which surrounds the towns of Daylesford and Hepburn Springs, in the Central Highlands area of Victoria, Australia. The Hepburn Regional Park was set up in 1977. It covers an area of 1,800 hectares. The park features a large number of minerals springs. In the Victorian gold rush of the 1850s' and 1860's there was a lot of gold mining in the area. There are many of these old gold mining sites within the forest. At the Blowhole on Sailors Creek, the miners dug a large tunnel to change the path of the creek so that they could search for gold. The Mount Franklin Reserve is also a part of the Hepburn Regional Park. This reserve protects the scoria cone of Mount Franklin, an extinct volcano. 

Most of the forest is fairly dry, with the main trees being box, peppermint and stringybark. In the south of the forest the climate is wetter, and manna gums, messmates and candlebark trees are common. In spring there are many wildflowers, including the Victorian floral emblem, Common or Pink Heath.

Animals in the forest include kangaroos, koalas and the rare Brush-tailed Phascogale. 

[[Creswick Regional Park]]

CATEGORIES: Protected areas of Victoria (Australia), Forests of Australia

The Creswick Regional Park, also known as the Creswick State Forest, is a large forest near the town of Creswick. It covers an area of 930 hectares. Much of the forest was heavily logged to supply timber to the gold mines in Ballarat and Creswick during the 1850s and 1860s. Many gold mining sites can be found in the forest.

St.Georges Lake is a man-made lake built to supply water for hydraulic sluicing. Eaton's Dam is another gold water supply. In 1942, students from the Creswick Forestry School fenced a small area of forest to create a breeding area for koalas. However the koalas were able to climb the fence, and the Koala Park was not successful.

A section of the Great Dividing Trail, the Wallaby Track, passes through the Creswick Regional Park. Some of it follows the water races built by the gold miners to supply water for their activities.

[[Canonical form]]

CATEGORIES: Mathematics

In mathematics and computer science the term Canonical form, or sometimes Normal form refers to the usual representation of a mathematical object. For example, the canonical form of a positive integer in decimal representation is a finite sequence of digits that does not begin with zero.

Mathematics has defined equivalence relations for some objects. These equivalence relations say that certain classes of objects are "equal". These objects then belong to the same equivalence class. In such a case, a canonical form consists in the choice of a specific object in each class. For example, row echelon form and Jordan normal form are canonical forms for matrices.

[[Enfield State Park]]

CATEGORIES: Protected areas of Victoria (Australia), Forests of Australia

The Enfield State Park, also known as the Enfield State Forest, is a large forest reserve south of Ballarat, Victoria, Australia. It covers an area of about 4,600 hectares. The Enfield State Park was once the site for gold mining, and there are many gold mining relics in the area. There was a Chinese settlement at Surface Point during the gold rush. There were temples, tearooms, gaming tents, herbalists and market gardens. People are still able to go searching for gold in the park. 

Timber from the forest was used for mining and building. There was a eucalyptus distillery at the town of Enfield, making eucalyptus oil.

There are also picnic areas and walking trails through the park.

The forest is an open dry forest, with messmates, peppermints, swamp gums, manna gums and the rare Yarra Gum. Over 100 bird species, and 22 native mammal species have been seen in the park.

[[Eucalyptus viminalis]]

CATEGORIES: Trees of Australia, Eucalyptus

Eucalyptus viminalis, or Manna Gum, is also known as White Gum, Ribbon Gum or Viminalis. It is an Australian eucalypt.

It is a straight tree growing to about 40 metres tall. It has rough bark on the trunk and the larger branches. The bark on the upper part of the tree peels away in long "ribbons" which can collect on the branches and surrounding ground. The tree with the largest recorded diameter (324.7 cm) is at Woodbourne in Marlborough, New Zealand.

E. viminalis grows in the cooler areas of Australia where the leaves are the favoured food of Koalas. The sap has a 5–15% sugar content which makes it an essential food for tree dwelling marsupials like the Yellow-bellied Glider, and the Sugar Glider.

There are three subspecies:

Timber is a pale pink to pinkish brown colour, often with distinctive light grey streaks. The attractive light pink tones of this species and its easy workability mean it is often used to make furniture. It has low strength and durability which makes it unsuitable for structural use, however some is used for house framing.

It can grow in temperatures as low as  −15 degrees Celsius (+5 °F) or more making it suitable for planting in Europe.

[[Heath]]

CATEGORIES: Habitats

A heath or heathland is a shrubland habitat found mainly on low quality, acidic soils. It has open, low growing woody vegetation. 

There are some clear differences between heath and moorland.  For example moorland has a very peaty topsoil, and it is also free-draining, whereas a heath is not.  Moorland is generally related to high-ground heaths with — especially in Great Britain — a cooler and damper climate.

Heathland is common worldwide. They form extensive and diverse communities across Australia in humid and sub-humid areas. Fire regimes with burning maintain the heathlands. Even more diverse though less widespread heath occurs in Southern Africa. Extensive heath communities can also be found in the California chaparral, New Caledonia, central Chile and along the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. In addition to these extensive heath areas, the vegetation type is also found in scattered locations across all continents except Antarctica.

[[Old Chicago Main Post Office Redevelopment]]

CATEGORIES: Skyscrapers in Chicago, Proposed skyscrapers in the United States

The Old Chicago Main Post Office Redevelopment was a proposed 20 project on a lot located along the Chicago River on the southwest side of Downtown Chicago, Illinois to be constructed in phases over a period of one decade that will include the renovation of Chicago's historic Old Main Post Office building as well as residential, retail, entertainment and office space. 

The plan includes several towers, the tallest one being a proposed 120-story mixed use twin tower skyscraper that will stand about 2000 high to the roof, which would make it the tallest building in the United States, over 500 taller than the Willis Tower, and will contain office, residential, and hotel space. It will also include two 60-story residential towers as well as a 40-story hotel. 

All the buildings in the development will be connected via a ground level complex that would be built over the Chicago River and the Eisenhower Expressway.

The proposal was sent to Chicago City Commission in July 2011 for approval, which was expected to be a several month process. The project is said to have an estimated cost of $3.5 billion and the potential to create 12,000 jobs. 

Some critics oppose the proposal in its current state, calling it old-fashioned and suburban and an unrealistic pipe dream, as it is largely car oriented (12,000 parking spaces and free parking) with shopping mall style retail.

The city voted and approved the plan July 18, 2013.  But the area was sold in 2016 thus the building was never built.

[[Steatorrhea]]

CATEGORIES: Diseases and disorders of the digestive system

Steatorrhea means excess undigested fat in feces. In this case, the feces is often lighter, sometimes whitish, in color. It produces a fouler-than-usual, sour-rancid smell, and floats on the surface of the water as opposed to sinking to the bottom of the toilet bowl.

Steatorrhea is caused by the inability to digest and absorb fat in the diet. It may be helped in some cases by taking enzymes, such as those usually produced by the body, which digest fat.

Research should be done, and a doctor consulted if necessary, to determine the cause of the inability to digest and absorb fat.

The causes range from mild to very severe and life-threatenting, so simply treating symptoms may not be enough.

[[Emulsion]]

CATEGORIES: Physical chemistry

An emulsion is what you get when you put two or more liquids together and the two liquids do not mix. Immiscible liquids do not mix together. For example, if you add oil to water, the oil floats on the surface of the water. And if you shake the two together then leave them to stand, tiny droplets of oil float upwards. These droplets join together until eventually the oil is floating on the water again. To stop the two liquids separating, we need a substance called an emulsifier.

Emulsifiers are molecules that have two different ends, a hydrophilic end (water-loving) that forms chemical bonds with water but not with oils, and a hydrophobic end (water-hating lipophile) that forms chemical bonds with oils but not with water.

[[Coupling constant]]

CATEGORIES: Quantum mechanics, Statistics

Every force has a coupling constant, which is a measure of its strength in an interaction. The coupling constant determines the chances of one particle to emit or absorb another particle. In electromagnetism, for example, the coupling constant is based on the electric charge. A coupling constant plays an important role in dynamics.

When physicists study the quantum behaviour of electromagnetism, they can not solve the whole theory exactly, because every particle may emit and absorb many other particles, which may also do the same, endlessly. So events of emission and absorption are considered as perturbations and are dealt with by a series of approximations.

This also can happen in string theory. String theories have a coupling constant. It determines the probability that a 1-dimensional string of energy will separate into two separate energy strings. But unlike in particle theories, the string coupling constant is not just a number, but depends on one of the oscillation modes of the string.

[[Ribozyme]]

CATEGORIES: RNA, Enzymes

A ribozyme (ribonucleic acid enzyme) is an RNA molecule that can help certain biochemical reactions. similar to the action of protein enzymes. 

Also called catalytic RNA, ribozymes  work in the ribosome to link amino acids during protein synthesis. They also take part in RNA splicing, viral replication, and transfer RNA biosynthesis. 

The 1981 discovery of ribozymes showed RNA can be both genetic material (like DNA) and a biological catalyst (like enzymes). This led to the RNA world hypothesis, in which RNA acts in the evolution of prebiotic self-replicating systems. 

Investigators studying the origin of life have produced ribozymes in the laboratory that can catalyze their own synthesis under certain conditions, such as an RNA polymerase ribozyme. Improved variants of the "Round-18" polymerase ribozyme have been developed. "B6.61" is able to add up to 20 nucleotides to a primer template in 24 hours, until it decomposes by cleavage of its phosphodiester bonds. The "tC19Z" ribozyme can add up to 95 nucleotides with great accuracy.

Some ribozymes may play an important role as therapeutic agents, as enzymes which target defined RNA sequences for cleavage, as biosensors, and for applications in genomics and gene discovery.

Designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, the cylindrical museum building is wider at the top than the bottom. He wanted it to be a "temple of the spirit". The building is one of the 20th century's most important architectural landmarks. The building opened on October 21, 1959, replacing rented spaces used by the museum since 1939.

To design the museum, Wright created more than 700 sketches until the final draft of the project was official. Wright spent 16 years working on the design, but he died before the building was completed. His design created a lot of arguments as many people did not like it. One person said it looked like "an indigestible hot cross bun", and another said it looked like "an inverted oatmeal dish." Some artists thought that the curved walls and ramps would make it impossible to hang their paintings properly.

[[Developmental coordination disorder]]

CATEGORIES: Disability

Developmental coordination disorder is a chronic disability that affects coordination. It is also known as developmental motor coordination disorder, developmental dyspraxia or dyspraxia. Around 2-6% of people have dyspraxia. Four times as many males than females have it. It is sometimes called 'clumsy child syndrome', but adults have it too. People with dyspraxia (Dyspraxics) may have other disabilities such as ADHD or autism.  

There is no single cause of dyspraxia. It may not be diagnosed until later in childhood or sometimes teenage years. It cannot be cured: people who have it will live with it for life, however people are able to overcome it and find alternative ways to accomplish tasks which may usually be difficult without support.

[[Pippi Longstocking]]

CATEGORIES: Movie characters, Television characters, Characters in written fiction

Pippi Longstocking (Pippi Långstrump) is a fictional character who originally appeared in a series of children's books by Swedish author Astrid Lindgren. The character has since adapted into several movies and television series. Pippi means "quirky" in old Swedish slang. She was named by Lindgren's daughter Karin, who was nine years old at the time. She had asked for a story from her mother one day when she was home sick from school.

Pippi is an unusual and spirited nine-year-old girl. She has superhuman strength, and is easily able to lift her horse with one hand. She often mocks and tricks adults she encounters; she usually reserves her worst behaviour for the most condescending adults. Pippi only really gets angry when someone treats her horse badly. Like Peter Pan, Pippi does not want to grow up. She is the daughter of a pirate captain and has adventurous tales to tell. She has four best friends: her horse, a monkey, and the neighbour's children Tommy and Annika.

The first three Pippi Longstocking books were published by Rabén and Sjögren from 1945 to 1948. Another series of six books were published between 1969 and 1975. Two final stories were printed in 1979 and 2000. The books have been translated into 64 languages.

[[Black Eye galaxy]]

CATEGORIES: Spiral galaxies

The Black Eye Galaxy (or Sleeping Beauty Galaxy; Messier 64, M64, Evil Eye Galaxy or NGC 4826) was discovered in 1779. It is a fairly close galaxy, just over 24 million light years away.

It has a spectacular dark band of absorbing dust in front of its bright nucleus. This is why it is called the "Black Eye" or "Evil Eye" galaxy. M64 is well known among amateur astronomers because it can be seen in small telescopes. It is a spiral galaxy in the Coma Berenices constellation.

[[Centaurus A]]

CATEGORIES: Starburst galaxies

Centaurus A or NGC 5128 is a prominent galaxy in the constellation  of Centaurus. It was discovered in 1826 by Scottish astronomer James Dunlop at his home in  New South Wales, Australia. 

NGC 5128 is either a Hubble type lenticular galaxy or a elliptical galaxy. It is 1016 million light-years away.

NGC 5128 is one of the closest radio galaxies to Earth. Its active center has been well studied. The galaxy is the fifth brightest in the sky, and is an ideal amateur astronomy target. The galaxy is only visible from low northern latitudes and the southern hemisphere.

Spitzer Space Telescope studies have confirmed that Centaurus A is colliding with, and devouring, a smaller spiral galaxy. Like other starburst galaxies, the collision produced the intense burst of star formation. 

The center of the galaxy has a supermassive black hole. Its mass is about 55 million solar masses. This ejects a relativistic jet with emissions in the X-ray and radio wavelengths. Astronomers have taken radio observations of the jet ten years apart. They found that the inner parts of the jet are moving at about half the speed of light. X-rays are produced further out as the jet collides with surrounding gas. This produces highly energetic particles. The radio jets of Centaurus A are over a million light years long.

[[Brownian motion]]

CATEGORIES: 1827, Albert Einstein, Basic physics ideas, Physics

Brownian motion is the random motion of particles in a liquid or a gas. The motion is caused by fast-moving atoms or molecules that hit the particles. Brownian Motion was discovered in 1827 by the botanist Robert Brown. In 1827, while looking through a microscope at particles trapped in cavities inside pollen grains in water, he noted that the particles moved through the water; but he was not able to find out what was causing this motion. 

Atoms and molecules had long been theorised as the main parts of matter.  Albert Einstein published a paper in 1905 that explained in precise detail how the motion that Brown had observed was a result of the pollen being moved by individual water molecules.  This was one of his first big contributions to science, and convinced many scientists that atoms and molecules exist,  It was further verified experimentally by Jean Perrin in 1908. Perrin was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1926 "for his work on the discontinuous structure of matter".  The direction of the force of atomic bombardment is constantly changing, and at different times the particle is hit more on one side than another, leading to the seemingly random nature of the motion.

There are too many molecular impacts making the Brownian pattern, so no scientific model can account for all of them.  That is why only probabilistic models of molecular populations can be used to describe it.  Two such models of the statistical mechanics, made by Einstein and Smoluchowski are presented below.  Another, pure probabilistic kind of models are stochastic process models.  There exist both simpler and more complicated stochastic processes which in extreme ("taken to the limit") may describe the Brownian Motion (see random walk and Donsker's theorem).

Albert Einstein and Norbert Wiener also studied Brownian Movement, with greater mathematical precision.

[[Monster movie]]

CATEGORIES: Movie genres

A monster movie (also called a creature feature or giant monster movie) is a movie with humans trying to stay alive in attacks by very large monsters. Monster movies can fit in the horror, fantasy, or science fiction genres. In Japan, large monsters are called kaiju.

In many monster movies, the monster is created by humans because of something such as a bad experiment, the effects of radiation, or the destruction of habitat. Since the 1953 movie The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms, many monster movies have shown the monster being created by nuclear warfare. One of the most well-known movie monsters, Godzilla, was created by a nuclear weapon. Godzilla has appeared in 28 movies and has become a cultural icon in Japan.

[[The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms]]

CATEGORIES: 1953 movies, Monster movies, 1950s science fiction movies, English-language movies, Warner Bros. movies

The African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) is a part of the African National Congress for younger people. It was founded in 1944 by Nelson Mandela and Walter Sisulu. They created the foundation to put an end to apartheid in Africa.

The African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) was established on 2 April 1944, by Anton Lambede (who became the League’s first President), Nelson Mandela, Ashby Mda, Walter Sisulu and Oliver Tambo. They were joined by, Duma Nokwe, B Masekela, Ida Mtwa, Lillian Ngoyi, James Njongweni, William Nkomo and Dan Tloome. The aim of the Youth League was to galvanise the youth to step up the fight against segregation within the country. At the time the ANCYL was established, political circumstances in South Africa were tenuous as the ruling United Party was divided about South Africa’s participation in World War II. Four years after the establishment of the Youth League, the United Party’s rule came to an end and the country was subsequently governed by the National Party.

[[Sit-ski]]

CATEGORIES: Skiing equipment

A Sit-ski is a sled used by a skier with paraplegia, spina bifida, muscular dystrophy, or cerebral palsy.  It is made from fiberglass. Early sit-skis looked like kayaks and had metal edges.

Sit-skis are used for para-Nordic skiing and para-alpine skiing.  If the sit-ski has one ski, it is sometimes name a mono-ski.  If a sit-ski has two skis, it is sometimes called a bi-ski.  Skiers first used bi-skis in para-alpine skiing before using mono-skis.  Mono-skis allow skiers to ski using the same way that people who stand ski down a hill.

Sit-ski users use outrigger skis.  In para-Nordic skiing, a sit-skier may use a normal ski pole that is not as long as one people standing up to ski would use.

When skiers first learn to ski, their teacher may be connected to them on a tether until the skier can control the sit-ski on their own.

[[Mono-ski]]

CATEGORIES: Skiing equipment

A mono-ski is a sled used by a skier with paraplegia, spina bifida, muscular dystrophy, or cerebral palsy.  Mono-skis are used only in para-alpine skiing.  People who use mono-skis need good balance to stop themselves from falling over.  The mono-ski has a chair with one ski attached to the bottom.

People first used mono-skis in 1985 in the United States.  Mono-skis allow skiers to ski using the same way that people who stand ski down a hill.

Mono-skis have a hydraulic lift.  This makes it easier for a skier to get in and out of the mono-ski.

[[Most distant things]]

[[UDFj-39546284]]

CATEGORIES: Galaxies

UDFj-39546284 is a 'stellar structure' (probably a galaxy) reported January 27, 2011 as light from the oldest object. It was detected through infrared observation by the Hubble Space Telescope.  It was reported in December 2012 to be at redshift z = 11.9 using Hubble and Spitzer telescope data, including Hubble Ultra-Deep Field (HUDF).

The actual stellar source of the light detected no longer exists. The image is likely to correspond to a compact mini-galaxy of blue stars that existed as we see it 13.42 billion years ago, around "380 million years" after the Big Bang (estimated at 13.8 billion years ago).

At the time of the announcement, it was the oldest galaxy found. It beat the previous distance record holder by about 150 million light years. With the revision of the distance, it again became the oldest galaxy found as of December 12, 2012. The next attempt to see further will be the James Webb Space Telescope launched sometime this decade.

Unlike UDFy-38135539, UDFj-39546284 has not been spectroscopically confirmed. A galaxy first formed near to the end of the Dark Ages, it offers information from early after the Big Bang.

[[Fluorescence]]

CATEGORIES: Light sources

Fluorescence is the light given off by certain substances when it absorbs light or other electromagnetic radiation. First the substance absorbs the energy, then it emits light. When the light source is removed, the fluorescence stops occurring. It is a form of luminescence.  

In most cases, the light given off has a longer wavelength and lower energy than the absorbed light.

One of the most surprising types of fluorescence is when a substance absorbs ultraviolet light that cannot be seen by the human eye, but gives off visible light.

Fluorescence is used in many fields such as mineralogy, gemology, chemical sensors (fluorescence spectroscopy), dyes, biological detectors, and fluorescent lights.

Fluorescence in the life sciences is a way of tracking biological molecules. A protein or other component can have a fluorescent dye attached to it, which allows a scientist to visually find the specific protein with a microscope.

[[Travesti]]

Famous travesty roles in opera include Cherubino in The Marriage of Figaro, Siebel in Faust, and Octavian in Der Rosenkavalier. In ballet, the role of Frantz in Coppélia was a travesty role at the Paris Opéra until the 1950s.  Carabosse in Tchaikovsky's ballet The Sleeping Beauty is performed by a man in woman's clothing. The Stepsisters in Prokofiev's ballet Cinderella are sometimes played by men in women's clothing. The title character is a travesty role in the Broadway musical Peter Pan.

[[Greyfriars Bobby]]

CATEGORIES: Individual dogs, Edinburgh

Greyfriars Bobby (4 May 1855 - 14 January 1872) was a Skye terrier. He belonged to a policeman in Edinburgh named John Gray. When Mr. Gray died in 1858, he was buried in Greyfriars Kirkyard. Bobby stayed near the grave of Mr. Gray long after the funeral. He would not leave. 

The little dog came to be called Greyfriars Bobby.  He stayed at the grave for the rest of his life. Bobby died in 1872. He was buried just inside the gates of the kirkyard. His grave is marked by a small pink granite stone. Bobby's collar and bowl are displayed in the Museum of Edinburgh.

In 1873, Lady Angela Burdett-Coutts erected a drinking fountain (pictured) in Edinburgh to the memory of Greyfriars Bobby.  The bronze statue of Bobby on top of the fountain was made by William Brodie. The fountain and statue have long been favourites of Scots. 

The fountain is near the George IV Bridge in Edinburgh. The statue of Bobby sits on top of a column of granite. At the bottom, there is an eight-sided drinking basin for dogs. Near the top, there is a drinking spout for people. In 1957, the water was turned off because of health concerns. 

Eleanor Stackhouse Atkinson wrote a book about Bobby in 1912. It has never been out of print. A movie based on the book was made in 1961. This movie stars Tam O'Shanter as Bobby, and is described as "a tearjerker, one that saddens and lifts the spirit at the same time."

[[Luminescence]]

CATEGORIES: Science, Light sources

Luminescence is light emitted by a substance not caused by heat. In contrast, incandescence is light emitted by a substance as a result of heating.

Luminescence can be caused by chemical reactions, electrical energy, subatomic motions, or piezoelectricity (stress on a crystal).   The term 'luminescence' was introduced in 1888 by Eilhard Wiedemann.

The dials, hands, scales and signs of aviation and navigational instruments and markings are often coated with luminescent materials in a process known as 'luminising'.

[[Victim blaming]]

CATEGORIES: Psychology, Discrimination, Crime

Victim blaming is holding the victim of a crime responsible for that crime. Starting in the 1970s, the term was commonly used in the United States. It was mainly used in connection with trials for rape, as well those with a racist background.

In 1947 Theodor W. Adorno defined what would be later called "blaming the victim," as "one of the most sinister features of the Fascist character".

Shortly after, Adorno and three other professors at the University of California, Berkeley created their influential and highly debated F-scale (F for fascist), published in The Authoritarian Personality (1950), which included among the fascist traits of the scale the "contempt for everything discriminated against or weak." A common example of victim blaming is the "asking for it" idiom, e.g. "she was asking for it" said of a victim of violence or sexual assault.

Ambroise Vollard (3 July 1866 – 21 July 1939) was one of the most important dealers in French modern art in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. He had his portrait painted by so many artists that Picasso said "The most beautiful woman who ever lived has never had her portrait painted, drawn, or engraved any oftener than Vollard".

In most cases he bought art directly from the painters of his day. He was the first owner of Cézanne's Vue sur l'Estaque et le Chateau d'If. This sold at Christie's in London for £13,522,500 in February 1015.

He sold these almost unknown artists, who became world-famous. They included Paul Cézanne, Aristide Maillol, Renoir, Louis Valtat, Pablo Picasso, André Derain, Georges Rouault, Paul Gauguin and Vincent van Gogh. He was also an avid art collector and publisher.

[[Parking lot]]

CATEGORIES: Road transport, Traffic

A parking lot (or car park) is an area where cars and other vehicles are parked and left temporarily. Parking lots are usually flat. The surface is usually made of asphalt, concrete, or gravel. Some lots may be bare earth. The paving material in a parking lot can heat quickly in the sun. A parked car can get hot, too. Children, older people, and animals such as dogs and cats should not be left in a parked car. They can die in a hot car.

Lines are put on paved lots to create the outlines of parking spaces. People leave their cars in these spaces while they go shopping, go to work, or do errands. Some spaces are set aside for disabled drivers or disabled passengers. These spaces are clearly marked. A disabled driver needs a special badge or insignia issued by the government to use these spaces. Disabled spaces are usually close to the front of a lot. Drivers who are not disabled can be fined or their cars towed if they use these spaces. 

Parking lots are usually near businesses, hospitals, government buildings, schools, hotels, zoos, etc. If many people go to these places, then the parking lots will be large. If not too many people go to these places, then the parking lots will be small. Small lots are usually unsupervised. Large lots are usually supervised by an attendant stationed in a small booth at the lot's entrance. He may issue a pass to a vehicle's driver that is stamped with the vehicle's arrival time. He will collect a fee from the driver when the vehicle leaves the lot. Some hotels provide free parking and those parking lots are big enough with lot of entrance. 

At a rural event such as a county fair, concert, auction, barn sale, corn maze, or pick-your-own strawberry patch, a parking lot may be nothing more than a large area of bare earth or a meadow that has been mowed for parking. Ropes or bales of hay may be used to mark the area for parking. An attendant may or may not be present. If present, he or she will advise a driver where to park in the lot and may or may not collect a fee.    

Parking lots can be dangerous, especially at night. Some lots are poorly supervised and dimly lit. Persons intent on mischief such as tire-slashers or criminal activity such as prostitutes, burglars, thieves, rapists, and drug dealers can operate without being easily seen. Anything valuable such as money, weapons, packages, children, or animals should never be left alone in a parked car. These will tempt thieves and child or animal snatchers. 

Broken glass, rusty nails, potholes, and rats can be parking lot hazards to people and their vehicles.

[[River system]]

CATEGORIES: Drainage basins, Rivers

A river system is sometimes called a drainage system. It is the whole natural water system in a drainage basin.

Water in a drainage basin usually ends up in the sea, but there are places where the water just evaporates, or flows into an inland lake. Lake Chad, for example, is an example of an endorheic lake, which has no outlet to the sea.

Rivers are an important feature of most landscapes, acting as the principal mechanism for the transport of weathered debris away from upland areas and carrying it to lakes and seas, where much of the classic sediment is deposited. River systems can also be deposition, accumulating sediment within channels and on floodplains. 

Water flow in rivers and streams is normally confined to channels  which are depressions or scours in the land surface that contain the flow. The floodplain is the land that is covered when the river is in flood. Together the channel and over bank settings comprise the "fluvial environment".

The audience is a vital part of the writing. If, say, writing medical instructions to help patients and care-providers, the writing might be for doctors & nurses; lay people with a good general education; or poorly-educated people. The writing would be quite different in each case. For example:

Technical writing communicates visually as well as verbally. A communication should follow an overall logic. One approach is descriptive, such as "Parts of a car engine". Another is the problem-solver: "How to change tyres". Practical encyclopedias usually inform and have how to do it sections. Medical encyclopedias are a good example. A medical encyclopedia provides information to readers about health questions.

[[Multi-instrumentalist]]

CATEGORIES: Multi-instrumentalists

A multi-instrumentalist is a musician who plays two or more musical instruments. Many professional musicians aim to become multi-instrumentalists.

In an orchestra, a number of musicians might each play a variety of different instruments during a single performance. Orchestras will also often, but not always, ask for several members of the woodwind section to be multi-instrumentalists. This is sometimes referred to as doubling. Typically, for example, one flute player in the orchestra will switch to playing the piccolo or alto flute when called to by the score. If an orchestra is playing a piece that needs "two flutes and a third flute doubling piccolo", it means that the third flautist also has a piccolo. Sometimes he or she will need to put the flute down and play the piccolo, then perhaps swap round again.

An oboist may sometimes double on the cor anglais, a clarinettist may sometimes double on a bass clarinet, and a bassoonist may double on a contrabassoon.  At other times such instruments may need a separate player.  At the beginning of a musical score there should be a list of instruments that makes it clear how many players are needed.

[[Assemblywomen]]

CATEGORIES: Long words, Ancient Greece

Assemblywomen is a satirical comedy by Aristophanes on the idea that women might be better than men at running the state.

The play is about a group of women, and their leader Praxagora. She has decided that the women must convince the men to give them control of Athens, because they could rule it better. The women, in the guise of men, sneak into the assembly and vote the measure, convincing some of the men to vote for it because it is the only thing they have not tried.

The women set up a government in which the state feeds, houses, and generally takes care of every Athenian. They enforce an idea of equality by allowing every man to sleep with every woman, but that the man must sleep with an ugly woman before he may sleep with a beautiful one.

There is a scene in which two men are talking. One of them is going along with the new government, giving his property to the women, and obeying their orders. The other does not wish to give up his property, but he is more than willing to take advantage of the free food.

The following scene has a pair of young lovers unable to make their tryst, as a succession of ever older and more hideous women attempt to and eventually succeed in dragging the man off to make love to him first, as laid down by the new laws.

Iron deficiency causes approximately half of all anemia cases worldwide, and affects women more often than men. This is partly because most women have periods (menstruate). There are probably more than one billion people who have anemia.

Anemia is most common in areas like Brazil or Central Africa. Asia, Central America and Eastern Europe are affected too, with North America least affected.

Symptoms include pale skin, tiredness, and weakness.

[[List of figures in Greek mythology]]

CATEGORIES: Greek gods and goddesses, Lists of gods and goddesses

This is a list of gods, goddesses, people and other figures from Greek mythology. They are sorted into sections below. The immortals include gods (deities), spirits and giants. Being immortal means that they live forever. The mortals include heroes, kings, Amazons and other people. The list does not include creatures.

These figures are described by ancient writers, the oldest of which are Homer and Hesiod. The Greeks created images of their deities for many reasons. A temple would house the statue of a god or goddess, or several deities. The statue might be decorated with relief scenes depicting myths. These were also often painted on pottery and minted on coins.

Roman mythology includes many of the same figures, but uses different names: calling Zeus by the name of Jupiter and Aphrodite by the name of Venus, for example. This is called the Venetian creole language. It is called Venetian band.

[[Land bridge]]

CATEGORIES: Landforms, Biology

A land bridge is a term in biogeography. It is a narrow land connection between otherwise separate areas, sometimes called an isthmus. 

Its significance is that animals and plants may cross over it when the sea level is lower. They cannot easily cross when the sea level is higher, and water covers the land bridge. The separation of a once connected population often leads to speciation, the splitting of one species into two and the two species change over time to be different but have distant similarities.

Several kinds of change can cause a land bridge to rise above or sink below the water. Plate tectonics may cause the rise or lowering of land. The causes of general sea level changes are not fully understood, but often big polar ice caps lower sea level by locking up much of the water. When sea levels fall, shallow sections of continental shelf may get exposed. Sometimes the sea floor rises due to "post-glacial rebound" after an ice age.

[[Chaperone (protein)]]

CATEGORIES: Molecular biology, Proteins

A molecular chaperone is a protein which does things to other proteins. They are mostly concerned with protein folding.  

Some help assemble or take apart other macromolecular structures. They do not occur in these structures when the structures go about their normal functions. 

What they do is:

The first protein to be called a chaperone assists the assembly of nucleosomes from folded histones and DNA. Those assembly chaperones, especially in the nucleus, assemble folded subunits into larger structures such as cell organelles.

One major function of chaperones is to prevent polypeptide chains and subunits sticking together in clumps which do not function. Some chaperones are "holdases" which act to stop aggregation. Others, called "foldases", do help fold proteins which cannot do it themselves. Such proteins violate Anfinsen's dogma, which said protein folding was automatic.

[[Muhammed Ahmed]]

CATEGORIES: Sudan, Religious leaders, 1845 births, 1885 deaths, Muslims

Muhammad Ahmad bin Abd Allah  (12 August 1845 – 22 June 1885) was a religious leader of the Sufi Samaniyya order in Sudan. On 29 June 1881, he proclaimed himself as the Mahdi or messianic redeemer of the Islamic faith.

His proclamation came during a period of widespread resentment among the Arabic part of the Sudanese population. They resented the oppressive policies of their Turco-Egyptian rulers (who were also muslims).

There were messianic beliefs among the various Sudanese religious sects of the time. There were earlier Mahdist movements in West Africa, and Wahhabism and other puritanical forms of Islamic revivalism. The root cause of this was the growing military and economic dominance of the European powers throughout the 19th century.

The British influenced the Sudan, and had claimed it as a "Joint Anglo-Egyptian Condominion". In general, the British were behind the rule of the Khedives of the Muhammad Ali Pasha dynasty in Egypt. At the time of the Mahdi, Egypt and the Sudan were ruled jointly by Tewfik Pasha as recognised by the Ottoman Empire, and by the British. Britain's claim to the Sudan led to British forces being sent there after the Mahdi had beaten the forces of the Khedive. The British government appointed General Charles George Gordon ("Gordon pasha") to be Governor General of the Sudan, and that led to his famous death in Khartoum at the hands of the Mahdi's forces.

From his announcement of the Mahdiyya in June 1881 until the fall of Khartoum in January 1885, Muhammad Ahmad led a successful military campaign against the Turco-Egyptian government of the Sudan. The fighting ended with the death of Gordon in Khartoum. After Muhammad Ahmad's unexpected death on 22 June 1885, only six months after the conquest of Khartoum, his chief deputy took over the administration of the Sudan. Churchill says they had by then killed all the people capable of running the country.

Lowell said that such a planet-like object could explain some irregularities in the orbits of the gas giants, in particular Uranus and Neptune. The gravity of a large unseen ninth planet could have perturbed Uranus enough to explain the irregularities. He called it "Planet X".

[[Jean de Venette]]

CATEGORIES: French historians, Monks, French writers, 1307 births, 1360s deaths

Jean de Venette (circa 1307 – after 1360) was born in Venette, France. He was a chronicler of the Hundred Years' War. He also recorded the events of the Black Plague, the revolt of the  Jacquerie, and other historical events that occurred in his lifetime.  Venette studied at the University of Paris. He became a Carmelite friar and shared his knowledge with his fellow monks.  Jean de Venette realized the importance of education and taught many monks how to read and write.  He also wrote a history of the Order of the Carmelites.

Jean de Venette became the Prior of the Carmelite monastery in Paris from 1339 to 1342, and was the Provincial Superior of France from 1341 to 1366. This later title made him the head of all of the Carmelite monasteries in the Province.

About 1340, he began to write down historical events happening around him.  He said he recorded them   "...in great measure as I have seen and heard them". He describes a great famine that he witnessed at age seven or eight years old.  He states it started on the 15th day of March in 1315 and lasted more than two years and ended in 1318."

In that same year of 1340 he describes a great comet that appeared in Gaul. He believed, as did many people in his time, that these events were warnings from God of bad things that would happen.

In 1341, de Venette states Prince John II of Brittany died.

In 1346 he announces that "King Edward of England set sail for Normandy with a great many armed men". 

In 1348, de Venette described the Black Plague and how brave the nuns were that cared for the people. Also how many of them died as a result of their dedication.

He wrote of battles between England and France during the Hundred Years' War where he was so close, "the arrows darkened the sky around him”.  Some of these battles he described were the siege of Calais in 1347 and the Battle of Poitiers (1356) where the French King and his son were captured.  He gives an account of what happened after Poitiers where he states that there seem to be no rule in the kingdom.  He wrote that "thieves and robbers rose up everywhere in the land and the Nobles also robbed and pillaged the peasants and took no thought for the people but rather for their own profit".

He states that in 1356, he witnessed the people of Paris building walls around their city because they did not trust the Nobles to protect them.  De Venette goes into great detail, stating that the "citizens placed iron chains across the streets and crossways of Paris".  They also built new walls, dug great ditches and tore down houses near the walls whether they were new or old.

Jean de Venette's writings are considered very important because he was an eye witness to many historical events.  His writings are detailed and vivid.  Many of the other well-known chroniclers wrote about events much later then they actually happened and relied upon one-sided accounts.  They were often commissioned by Kings and Nobles who wanted their particular point of view to be stressed.

Jean de Venette died after 1360.

[[Blurred Lines (song)]]

"Blurred Lines" is an R&B song by Robin Thicke. It has vocals by Pharrell and T.I. and was produced by Pharrell. It was released on March 26, 2013. It was the lead single from his album Blurred Lines. It has reached number one in 14 countries. It became Thicke's most successful song, being his first to reach number one on the Hot 100. He had already peaked number 14 in 2007 with "Lost Without U".

"Blurred Lines" sold more than any other single in 2013. It sold over 1.44 million copies.

Two versions of the music video were made. The first version of the video was removed from YouTube for showing topless models Emily Ratajkowski, Elle Evans, and Jessi M'Bengue.  In the second version the models are not topless. Several parodies were made. On November 12, the English pop singer Lily Allen released the video for her single "Hard Out Here". It featured Mylar balloons spelling out "Lily Allen has a baggy pussy", spoofing the balloons in Thicke's video saying "Robin Thicke has a big dick".

Thicke wanted the song to sound like Got to Give It Up by Marvin Gaye. Members of Gaye's family have accused Thicke, T.I. and Pharrell of illegal copying. Thicke offered the family a six-figure sum of money to end the lawsuit but they did not accept it.

The song was banned by twenty UK universities. Essex University students started a petition to have the song banned there too. Alice Smart, a Leeds Student Union officer, said, “I’m proud that we’ve taken the decision to stop playing ‘Blurred Lines’ in our bars and clubs because the song undermines real and dangerous issues around consent. Just because the song has been commercially successful doesn’t mean we have to play it knowing that it offends a high proportion of our students.” Thicke responded on The Today Show to feminist criticism of the song by saying, "If you listen to the lyrics it says 'That man is not your maker.' It's actually a feminist movement in itself". He also said in an interview with the BBC that criticism of the lyrics by a rape charity is 'ridiculous'.

Thicke has said that he would like to do another song with T.I. and Pharrell.

On December 26, 2013, Rob Sheffield wrote for Rolling Stone that "Blurred Lines" was the worst song not just of the year, but of any year.

In December 2013, "Blurred Lines" was nominated for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance and Record of the Year at the Grammy Awards.

The video for "Blurred Lines" was the seventh most watched video on VEVO in 2013.

[[Draco (lawgiver)]]

CATEGORIES: Year of birth unknown, Year of death unknown, Ancient Greek politicians, People from Athens

Draco (7th century BC) was the first legislator of the city of Athens in Ancient Greece. He wrote laws that were to be enforced only by a court. This constitution replaced the system of oral law and blood feuding that had governed Athens since the city was founded. Draco's laws were known for being harsh. The word draconian has come to mean unforgiving rules or laws.

Draco established this legal system during the 39th Olympiad, in about 622 or 621 BC. The laws (θεσμοί - thesmoi) he set formed the first written constitution of Athens. They were displayed in public, so that nobody would be unaware of them. The death penalty was the punishment for most crimes, even minor ones. Plutarch states: "It was a lot for himself, when asked why he had fixed the punishment of death for most offences, answered that he considered these lesser crimes to deserve it, and he had no greater punishment for more important ones."

Not much is known about Draco's life or who he was. The 10th-century Suda text tells a legendary story of his death. He was said to have died on the stage of the theatre in Aegina. In a traditional ancient Greek show of approval, his supporters threw so many hats and pieces of clothing onto his head that he suffocated.

All of Draco's laws, except the law concerning murder, were abolished by Solon in the early 6th century BC.

Draco can mean several things:

[[Lunar Society]]

CATEGORIES: Members of the Lunar Society, Birmingham

The Lunar Society was an important club in the Midlands of 18th century England. It was a dinner club, and a learned society. Its members were industrialists and inventors, natural philosophers (scientists), and other intellectuals. They met regularly in Birmingham and elsewhere from 1765 to 1813. 

The name arose because the society met during the full moon. The extra light made the journey home easier and safer in the absence of street lighting. The members cheerfully referred to themselves as "lunarticks", a pun on lunatics. Venues included Erasmus Darwin's home in Lichfield, Matthew Boulton's home, Soho House, and Great Barr Hall.

It leading members were Matthew Boulton, Erasmus Darwin, Thomas Day, Richard Lovell Edgeworth, Samuel Galton, Jr., James Keir, Joseph Priestley, William Small, Jonathan Stokes, James Watt, Josiah Wedgwood, John Whitehurst and William Withering. Other great men of the day visited, or corresponded with, the Society. It had no formal membership list, and was flexible in its arrangements. Anyone could be invited.

The club was seriously affected by the Priestly Riots of July 1791, which started in Birmingham, and spread. Some of the Society were personally attacked; Priestley's house was burned to the ground. The causes of the riots are not entirely clear, but for sure the rioters were against "freethinkers and dissenters".

Matthew Boulton FRS (3 September 1728 – 17 August 1809) was an English manufacturer and the business partner of Scottish engineer James Watt.

In the last quarter of the 18th century, the partnership installed hundreds of Boulton & Watt steam engines. A great advance on the state of the art, they made possible the mechanisation of factories and mills. Boulton applied modern techniques to the minting of coins, striking millions of pieces for Britain and other countries, and supplying the Royal Mint with up-to-date equipment.

Born in  Birmingham in 1728, Boulton was the son of a Birmingham manufacturer of small metal products who died when Boulton was 31. By then Boulton had managed the business for several years, and he expanded it considerably at the Soho Manufactory, built by him near Birmingham.

When Watt's business partner, John Roebuck was unable to pay a debt to Boulton, he accepted Roebuck's share of Watt's patent as settlement. He then successfully lobbied Parliament to extend Watt's patent for an additional 17 years. This enabled the firm to market Watt's steam engine. The firm installed hundreds of Boulton & Watt steam engines in Britain and abroad, initially in mines and then in factories.

Boulton was a key member of the Lunar Society, a group of Midlands men in the arts, sciences, and theology.  Members included Watt, Erasmus Darwin, Josiah Wedgwood and Joseph Priestley.  The Society met each month near the full moon.  Members of the Society developed concepts and techniques in science, agriculture, manufacturing, mining, and transport that laid the groundwork for the Industrial Revolution.

Boulton founded the Soho Mint, which he adapted to steam power.  He sought to improve the poor state of Britain's coinage. After several years of effort obtained a contract in 1797 to produce the first British copper coinage in a quarter century.  His "cartwheel" pieces were well-designed and difficult to counterfeit, and included the first striking of the large copper penny, which continued to be coined until decimalisation in 1971. He retired in 1800, though continuing to run his mint, and died in 1809. His image appears alongside James Watt on the Bank of England's new Series F £50 note.

[[Fishbourne Roman Palace]]

CATEGORIES: Buildings and structures in England, Ancient Rome, Archaeological sites in England

Fishbourne Palace is a huge Roman villa from the 1st century AD, about thirty years after the Roman conquest of Britain. It is near the south coast in the village of Fishbourne, Chichester in West Sussex. It was built on the site of a Roman army supply base built during Claudian invasion in 43 AD. 

The palace is by far the largest known Roman residence north of the Alps. At about 500 feet (150 m) square, it is larger than Buckingham Palace. It is about the size of Nero's Golden House in Rome or the Roman villa at Piazza Armerina in Sicily. In plan it closely mirrors the layout of the emperor Domitian's palace, the Domus Flavia, completed in AD 92 on the Palatine Hill in Rome.

The rectangular palace surrounded formal gardens, the northern half of which have been reconstructed. There were extensive alterations in the 2nd and 3rd centuries, with many of the original black and white mosaics being overlaid with more sophisticated coloured work, including the perfectly preserved dolphin mosaic in the north wing. More alterations were in progress when the palace burnt down in around 270, after which it was abandoned.

One theory is that it was built for Sallustius Lucullus, a Roman governor of Britain of the late 1st century. Two inscriptions recording the presence of Lucullus have been found in nearby Chichester and the dating of the palace to the early AD 90s, would fit. If the palace was designed for Lucullus, then he may have only used it for a few years: the Roman historian Suetonius says Lucullus was executed by the delusional emperor Domitian in or shortly after AD 93.

[[Eartham Pit, Boxgrove]]

CATEGORIES: Archaeological sites in England, West Sussex, Stone Age, Tools

Boxgrove Quarry, once a gravel quarry, is now a Palaeolithic archaeological site. It is at Boxgrove in the English county of West Sussex. It is a Site of Special Scientific Interest.

When excavations began in 1983, flint tools 500,000 years old were discovered. At that time this was the oldest evidence of humans discovered in the UK. In 2005 flint tools 700,000 years old were discovered at Pakefield, and in 2010 flint tools at least 800,000 years old were discovered at Happisburgh. However, Boxgrove remains a site of great importance, for many reasons. The tools were found in a largely undisturbed state, in situ in their prehistoric landscape. The tools and evidence of the landscape were buried several metres down.

There were many well-preserved animal bones, many flint artifacts, and hominid bones which are among some of the most ancient found in Europe. Several of the animal bones are the oldest found specimens of their species, such as the wing bone of the Great Auk found at the site in 1989. The combination of bones, stone artifacts, and the geology of the landscape gives a very complete picture of the coastal plain as it existed half a million years ago.

Parts of the site complex were excavated between 1983 and 1996 by a team led by Mark Roberts of the Institute of Archaeology, University College London. The site is in an area that features a buried chalk cliff that overlooked a flat beach (which contained a waterhole) stretching around half a mile (1 km) south to the sea.

[[History of science]]

CATEGORIES: History of science

The history of science is the study of the historical development of science and scientific knowledge. The English word scientist is relatively recent  first coined by William Whewell in the 19th century. Previously, people investigating nature called themselves "natural philosophers".

Science is a body of knowledge about the natural world, produced by scientists who observe, explain, and predict real world phenomena. Historiography of science, in contrast, often draws on the historical methods. 

Facts about the natural world have been described since classical antiquity. Ancient Greece is perhaps most famous for its contributions to astronomy and mathematics. Aristarchus of Samos came up with the idea of the Sun at the centre of what we now call the Solar system many centuries before Galileo.

Others, like Thales and Aristotle were interested in the natural world.

Scientific methods have been used since the Middle Ages (Roger Bacon), but the dawn of modern science is often traced back to the early modern period and in particular to the scientific revolution that took place in 16th- and 17th-century Europe. Important figures in the development of modern science include Isaac Newton, Johannes Kepler, Robert Boyle, Charles Darwin, Wilhelm Roux and Albert Einstein.

Scientific methods are so fundamental to modern science that some consider earlier inquiries into nature to be pre-scientific. Traditionally, historians of science have defined science sufficiently broadly to include those inquiries.

The natural sciences are these:

There are various applied sciences which depend on one of more of the natural sciences. Medicine is an example.

[[Water pollution]]

CATEGORIES: Water pollution

Water pollution is the pollution of bodies of water, such as lakes, rivers, seas, the oceans, as well as groundwater.  It occurs when pollutants reach these bodies of water, without treatment. Waste from homes, factories and other buildings get into the water bodies and as a result water gets contaminated.

Water pollution is a problem for the species and ecosystems there. It affects plants and organisms living in the water. In almost all cases the effect is damaging not only to individual species and populations, but also to the wider biological communities. The color is usually green or brown but normal water can be blue.

Agriculture is one of the major sources of water pollution. The fertilizers given to the crops for better growth are washed into rivers and lakes, which in turn pollutes the water.

There are many chemicals that are naturally found in these bodies of water. Today water may be polluted by nitrates, phosphates, oil, acid rain, and debris such as sediment, fallen logs and so on. When people and animals drink water from such rivers, the poisonous chemicals may affect them. Life in rivers are also affected, and  humans who consume fish may also have health problems.

[[Heated shot]]

CATEGORIES: Ballistics

Heated shot is the heating of round shot before firing from muzzle-loading cannons.  The purpose is for setting fire to enemy warships, buildings, or equipment. 

The use of hot shot dates back centuries.  It was stopped when vessels armored with iron replaced wooden warships in the world's navies. It was a powerful weapon against wooden warships, where fire was always a hazard. It was mainly used on shore batteries and forts, due to the need for a special furnace to heat the shot.  

The use of heated shot from a ship was so dangerous, that it was against Royal Navy regulations. The American ship USS Constitution had a shot furnace installed, for hot shot to be fired.

[[The Inheritors (novel)]]

CATEGORIES: 1955 books, Fantasy books, William Golding

The Inheritors is the 1955 second novel by the British author William Golding, who is best known for Lord of the Flies. It was his personal favourite, and concerns the extinction of one of the last remaining tribes of Neanderthals at the hands of the more sophisticated (and malevolent) Homo sapiens.

One of the band, Lok, is a "point of view" character. He is the one we follow as one by one the adults of the band die or are killed, then the young are stolen by the "new people" The new people are a group of early modern humans. Lok and Fa, the remaining adults, are both fascinated and repelled by the new people. They observe their actions and rituals with amazement, only slowly understanding that harm is meant by the 'sticks' (arrows) of the new people.

Lok's people have powerful sense-impressions and feelings, and appear sometimes to share thoughts in a near-telepathic way. They live very simply, using their mental abilities to connect to one another without extensive vocabulary or the kinds of memories that create culture. They have wide knowledge of food sources, mostly roots and vegetables. Their lives are lived so much in the present that the reader realizes they are very different from us, living in something like an eternal present, or at least a present broken and shaped by seasons. The way they cope with planning and imagination is by saying the phrase "I have a picture", and then talking about their thoughts.

In the final chapter, we move to the point of view of the new race, more or less modern humans fleeing in their boats. Apparently they are terribly afraid of the Neanderthals whom they believe to be devils of the forest. This last chapter, the only one written from the humans' point of view, points to the inheritance of the world by the new species.

[[Centwine of Wessex]]

CATEGORIES: Year of birth unknown, 680s deaths, Kings of Wessex

Centwine († 685) was King of Wessex from 676 to 685. He appears to have been one of several underkings of Wessex after the death of Cenwalh. But at some point he united the kingdom of Wessex under his rule. 

== King of Wessex == 

Centwine was the probable son of Cynegils and grandson of Ceolwulf, King of Wessex. According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle Centwine became king 676. Also that he succeeded Aescwine. Bede wrote that after the death of King Cenwalh: "his under-rulers took upon them the kingdom of the people, and dividing it among themselves, held it ten years". Bede's view of Aescwine and Centwine as underkings may represent the views of King Ine. His family ruled Wessex in Bede's time. If the kingdom did fragment following Cenwalh's death, it was reunited during Centwine's reign. An entry under 682 in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records that "Centwine drove the Britons to the sea". Aldhelm wrote Centwine won three major victories but does not say who he defeated. Centwine is reported to have abdicated and became a monk. The date of his death is unknown.

Hugo based some of his characters on the lives of real people. That way, Valjean is probably based upon Eugène François Vidocq. He probably used the story of Bienvenu de Miollis to base the Bishop of Digne on. De Mollis was the bishop of Digne from 1805 to 1838.

[[Blind experiment]]

CATEGORIES: Experiments

A blind or blinded experiment is a test or experiment in 

where the experimenter does not know which treatment is given to a subject. The idea is to avoid bias which the experimenter might otherwise introduce. If both tester and subject are blinded, the trial is a double-blind trial.

Suppose consumers are asked to compare the tastes of different brands of a product.  Obviously, the identities of the product should be hidden – otherwise consumers tend to prefer the brand they are familiar with. Similarly, when testing a pharmaceutical drug, both patients and experimenter should not know the dosage being given in each case.

The opposite of a blind trial is an open trial. The terms blind (adjective) or to blind (transitive verb) when used in this sense are figurative extensions of the literal idea of blindfolding someone.

[[Anniversary]]

CATEGORIES: Days, Chronology, Holidays

An anniversary is a day on which people remember or celebrate an event that happened on the same date in a past year. The most common example is a birthday, where the birth of a person is celebrated every year on the month and day of which they were born. The first anniversary of something is celebrated exactly one year after the initial event occurred. The word was first used for Catholic feasts to commemorate saints.

Other examples of common anniversaries are those of weddings and deaths. Having anniversaries for sad incidents can be for remembering someone special, like a famous person that touched many peoples lives or to remember a tragic incident, so that it doesn't happen again. Most countries around the world celebrate national anniversaries. These could be the date of independence of the nation or the adoption of a new constitution, or the coronation of a monarch.

There are different Latin names used for anniversaries depending on the number of years that has passed since the initial event. For example, biennial means that two years has passed, decennial means that ten years has passed, and centennial means that 100 years has passed. For example, many countries have held a big celebration in the 100th anniversary of their country.

[[File hosting service]]

CATEGORIES: Internet, File sharing

A file hosting service is an Internet service that stores files for its users. It allows users to upload files that could then be accessed over the internet from a different computer, tablet, smart phone or other networked device, after a password is provided. The files can possibly also be accessed by other users, depending on the service or what the user prefers.

A variation of this is one-click hosting, which allows users to easily upload one or more files from their hard drives (or from a remote location) on to the one-click host's server. Many web services provide free one-click hosting for image files.  This gives the file an accessible URL that can be used to identify it on the internet.

Coronary artery bypass surgery is a type of surgery that relieves chest pain, caused by lack of blood flow, and reduces the risk of death from heart disease. It is also known as coronary artery bypass graft (CABG, pronounced "cabbage") surgery, and known by doctors as heart bypass or bypass surgery. In this surgery, blood vessels from elsewhere in the patient's body are added to the heart vessels to go around blood vessels blocked by fat and get more blood into the heart so it can keep running. This surgery usually happens with the heart stopped, which makes machines that act as lungs and heart needed. However, it is possible to have the surgery with the heart still pumping, called "off-pump" surgery. 

[[Puck (Shakespeare)]]

CATEGORIES: Folklore, Characters in Shakespeare's plays

Puck is a character in a play called A Midsummer Night's Dream. This play was written by William Shakespeare. In this play, Puck is a servant to the Fairy King, Oberon. Puck has some amazing abilities. For example, he can travel around the world in 40 minutes. In spite of his abilities, Puck makes a few mistakes in the play that create confusion for the other characters. For example, he puts a love potion into the wrong person's eyes. He also plays tricks. He puts a donkey's head on one character. 

Puck was not Shakespeare's invention. He was a character in folklore called 'pouke'. He was known as early as 1000 AD. He was an evil, dangerous demon. By the time of Geoffrey Chaucer, he had become linked with the Biblical devil. By Shakespeare's day, he was known as Puck, Robin Goodfellow, and Hobgoblin. He was a goblin who made mischief. 

By the time of Shakespeare and other Elizabethan poets, Puck had become a combination of English folklore and English country life. Shakespeare writes that Puck would frighten the village girls, ruin the butter, and lead travelers in the night the wrong way. Mickey Rooney played Puck in a 1935 movie adaptation of Shakespeare's play. 

Shakespeare used a description of Puck from Reginald Scot's The Discoverie of Witchcraft (1584). Scot describes Puck with disapproval. He points out that people no longer believe in him. Scot also tells of a man whose head was replaced with the head of a donkey.

[[Shylock]]

CATEGORIES: Characters in Shakespeare's plays

Pravesh Singh Patel is a key character and the antagonist in Shakespeare's 2007 or 2070 play The Merchant of Venice. He is a Jewish moneylender.

Pravesh agrees to a bond with Antonio, the merchant of Venice. This bond requires Antonio to give a pound of his flesh next his heart should the money not be repaid on a certain date. When Antonio fails, Shylock goes to court to get the pound of flesh. Antonio had previously insulted and spat on him in the Rialto (the commercial centre of Venice). This helps to explain why Shylock demanded his pound of flesh.

Meanwhile, Shylock's daughter Jessica falls in love with Antonio's friend Lorenzo and converts to Christianity. This adds to Shylock's rage.

Shylock fails in court, and Antonio is released. Shylock is charged with attempted murder. Shylock is then forced to give half of his properties to the country and the other half to Antonio and to convert to Christianity.

Shylock has a famous speech beginning "Hath not a Jew eyes?" Famous actors who have played Shylock include Laurence Olivier.

In Shakespeare's time, no Jews had been legally present in England for several hundred years (since Edward I's Edict of Expulsion in 1290). But the idea of Jews as money lenders remained from the Middle Ages. Historically, money lending had been a fairly common occupation among Jews, perhaps because Christians were not allowed to practise usury.

[[Stingy Jack]]

CATEGORIES: Folklore, Irish culture, Fictional characters

Stingy Jack is a character in Irish folklore. He was a poor, dirty man who was often drunk. He outsmarted the devil at least three times.

He invited the devil to have a drink with him. Jack did not want to pay for the drink. He persuaded the devil to change himself into a coin. The devil did so, and Jack put the coin in his pocket. There was a silver cross in his pocket that made it impossible for the devil to return to his original shape. Jack eventually allowed the devil to resume his shape, but only after he promised not to bother Jack for a whole year and to not try to claim his soul when he died.

On another occasion, Jack persuaded the devil to climb an apple tree to gather apples. Jack quickly carved crosses into the trunk of the tree, making it impossible for the devil to come down. Jack allowed the devil to come down, but only after he promised not to bother Jack for ten years and not to claim his soul when he died.

On the third occasion, Jack died before the ten-year time limit. God did not want Jack in Heaven, so he was sent to Hell. The devil could not claim his soul, so Jack was sent back into the world. The devil gave him a glowing coal to light his way in the darkness. Jack put the coal into a hollowed-out turnip. He is said to still walk the earth with his lantern, and can be seen around All Saints Day November 1.

Jack became known as "Jack of the lantern". This name was shortened to "Jack-o'-lantern". In the United States, his lantern became a pumpkin rather than a turnip. Pumpkins were common in the U.S. and easier to carve. The story of Jack is little known, perhaps because he was an unsuitable role model for entertaining children.

[[Titration]]

CATEGORIES: Analytical chemistry

Titration is a type of quantitative chemical analysis. It is used to work out the unknown concentration of a known substance. 

It makes the use of two main chemical apparatus namely, pipette and burette. External indicators like phenolphthalein or methyl orange and internal indicators like KMnO4 (potassium permanganate) are used to mark the end point of titration.

A known concentration and volume of a reagent, called the titrant or titrator, is added to a known volume of another reagent, the analyte or titrand. This is done slowly from a burette until the end point is reached. The volume added before the end point is reached is noted. Because one of the solutions, the titrant, has a known concentration, that of the other, the titrand, can be calculated.

Professionals now use a pH meter, which is potentiometer with an electrode whose potential depends on the amount of H+ ions in the solution. The pH of the solution is measured throughout the titration, more accurately than with an indicator. At the endpoint there is a sudden change in the measured pH.

Since volume measurements play a key role in titration, it is known as volumetric analysis as well as quantitative analysis.

[[Diderot effect]]

CATEGORIES: Sociology, Economics

The Diderot effect is a phenomenon from sociology, which was named after Denis Diderot, who first described it in an essay. In the essay, Diderot talked about a robe he used to wear in the bathroom: The old robe was a little shabby, but useful. When he was given a new robe, the new robe was more shiny, and nicer, but it did not fit well with the other clothes. 

Regrets on Parting with My Old Dressing Gown: I was absolute master of my old dressing gown,” Diderot writes, “but I have become a slave to my new one … Beware of the contamination of sudden wealth. The poor man may take his ease without thinking of appearances, but the rich man is always under a strain.

So, the Diderot effect describes that people often show a tendency to buy more goods after they bought one item. It is said that they do this to restore the general perception they had about their belongings.

[[Ocean gyre]]

CATEGORIES: Oceanography

A gyre is a large system of ocean currents moving in a circle. Gyres are caused by the Coriolis effect. Because the Earth is rotating, ocean currents in the northern hemisphere tend to move in a clockwise direction and currents in the southern hemisphere in an anti-clockwise direction. The Coriolis force acts most strongly on the wind, and the wind then creates a torque that tends to spin the ocean currents.

The Earth rotates from the west towards the east, and the Coriolis effect becomes more intense toward the poles. Because of this, gyres form strong currents on the western side of oceans, so they are pushed against the eastern coast of continents. The vorticity (the strength of the torque force) is balanced out by frictional surface currents, which normally act against the spin of the water. However, in the middle of the ocean, the effects of friction are very weak.

The term gyre can be used to mean any type of vortex in the air or the sea, but it is most used in oceanography for the major ocean current systems.

[[Clonazepam]]

CATEGORIES: Drugs, Drugs used in psychiatry

Clonazepam is an anticonvulsant. This means it can be used to stop seizures. It is also used to lessen states of fear. It is an anxiolytic. It is a benzodiazepine. Benzodiazepines are very addictive. Clonazepam is used to treat certain forms of epilepsy. It is also used to treat certain disorders of sleep, such as sleepwalking. In certain cases it is used as an off-label drug in psychiatry. It is also used for panic disorders.

Clonazepam works by increasing the activity of gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA). This is a chemical that sends signals throughout a person’s nervous system. If a person does not have enough GABA, their body may be in an excited state. This may cause them to have panic attacks or seizures. When a person takes this drug, they will have more GABA in their body. This will help them have fewer panic attacks and seizures.

It is not recommended that you take clonazepam with an opioid medication since this combination can more easily lead to loss of consciousness, respiratory depression, and overdose death. Similarly, drinking alcohol while taking the medication is also extremely dangerous and can result in accidental overdose.

CATEGORIES: Movies, Mockbuster movies

A mockbuster (also called a knockbuster or a drafting opportunity) is a movie made to take advantage of the publicity of a similar major movie. These types of movies are often made on a low budget. They are made to be released direct-to-video at the same time that the original movie is released in theaters or on video.

Mockbusters are often made to make customers mistakenly buy the movie instead of the one that they wanted. For example, someone may think that they are buying Transformers, but they are actually buying Transmorphers, a mockbuster that was released in 2007. Because of this, a mockbuster will often use a title similar to the original movie.

Many mockbusters are made in a different country than the one that the original movie was made in. There are many Turkish, Italian, German, French and Brazilian versions of American movies, as well as sequels that were not made by the people who made the original movie.

CATEGORIES: 1300 births, 1356 deaths, French writers, Knights, Crusaders

Geoffroi de Charny (c. 1300 – 19 September 1356) was the Lord of Lirey, a French knight and a writer. Sir Geoffroi was born of an important French family.  Throughout his life he fought many battles for France. He fought in the Crusades and many times throughout the war with England.   He was always loyal to his King, Jean II, King of France and died at the Battle of Poitiers protecting him. Throughout his lifetime he was well known and well respected by both the French and the English kings and nobles.  At Poitiers he was chosen to carry the Oriflamme into battle.  The Oriflamme was the Kings banner and this was a great honor given to a knight by the King.  He was also one of the Knights chosen to fight close to and protect the King. De Charny was said to be a "true and perfect Knight".

Jean de Joinville was de Charny's grandfather's.  He was a close friend of King Louis IX and author of his biography.  In the same tradition, Sir Geoffroi wrote three books in his time.  His most famous book was "A Knight's Own Book of Chivalry".  In this book he shared his great skill and knowledge of combat.  The second book written by de Charny is entitled, "Requests (or Questions) for jousting tournaments and war".  It was written about 1352 to the Knights of the Order of the Star which Sir Geoffroi founded.  This book was written in the form of questions.  His third book was the book "Charny", describes the life of a knight and lists the qualities a good knight must possess.

Charny fought in Flanders and Tournay.  He was taken prisoner but was ransomed because the King considered him so important.  He fought in many major battles during the Hundred Years' War such as the battles of Calais, Crecy and Poitiers.

Sir John Chandos was a close friend and biographer of Edward, the Black Prince, the eldest son of King Edward III of England.  Chandos was a famous knight himself.   He was an educated man and wrote down the events of a great meeting of both sides before the Battle of Poitiers. He wrote that at that meeting Sir Geoffroi tried to avoid a great bloodshed by proposing a smaller battle where 100 knights on each side would do battle with each other and the outcome would decide the battle.  Chandos writes that Charny was trying to find an honorable solution to avoid a great many more deaths.  The Black Prince refused that offer.  Charny’s predictions turned out to be true and indeed a great many nobles on both sides lost their life that day, including de Charny himself.

Charny died at the Battle of Poitiers while protecting the King.

[[Harrow (tool)]]

CATEGORIES: Agricultural machinery

A harrow is a farm tool.  It is an implement for breaking up and smoothing out the surface of the soil. In this way it is different from a plow, which cuts deeper into the soil. A plow also lifts up the soil and tips it over, but a harrow works mostly by cutting into the soil and breaking it up. Harrowing is often carried out on fields to follow the rough surface left by plowing. 

The purpose of this harrowing is generally to break up clods (lumps of soil) and to provide a finer finish, a good tilth or soil structure that is good for planting seeds. It may also be used to remove weeds and to cover up seed after sowing. 

Harrows differ from cultivators in that they disturb the whole surface of the soil, instead of disturbing only narrow trails that avoid crop rows (to kill weeds).

[[List of road routes in New South Wales]]

CATEGORIES: Roads in Australia, New South Wales, Lists of roads

Major roads in New South Wales are organised into many routes. These help drivers to navigate their way between places in the state. Each route is given its own route number.

The route system includes highways, motorways, and other important roads that have not been declared highways.

Route numbers have been allocated to roads in New South Wales since 1955. To supplement the national route number system, three ring roads were built in Sydney in 1964. These were numbered 1, 3 and 5. In 1973, a system of numbering freeways was introduced to New South Wales to complement the national routes and ring roads. In 1974, the National Highway network was defined, which in New South Wales included the Hume Highway, Federal Highway, Barton Highway, Sydney-Newcastle Freeway (now Pacific Motorway) and New England Highway.

[[Lubricant]]

CATEGORIES: Oils, Materials

A lubricant is a substance used to reduce friction between moving surfaces. The property of reducing friction is known as lubricity (slipperiness).

A good lubricant possesses the following characteristics:

The most often used lubricant is motor oil, which is used in engines of cars and motorcycles.

Sometimes, chemicals are added to normal oil to give it special properties. A lubricant, like motor oil, can also help in reducing heat. Simply put, cooling depends on surface area in contact. So, if something normally has a small surface area, you can put that thing into a bigger pot, and put oil in the pot. This way, oil comes in contact with small surface area of the small object, and transfers that heat to the big surface area of the big vessel. As a rule, liquids can transfer heat better than gases.

In manufacturing, sometimes oil is used to cool the item being made. This also helps in removing metal that was just chipped off. This chipped-off metal normally flows with the oil until it is filtered. Then the oil is reused. The filtered metal chips are normally scrapped.

Sometimes, lubricants are used for hydraulic machines. A hydraulic machine uses the fact that the hydraulic oil cannot be compressed, and performs a simple conversion – it works like a lever.

Some common lubricants are:

Oils can cause pollution, especially water pollution, if released into the open.

[[Isotopes of hydrogen]]

CATEGORIES: Hydrogen, Isotopes

Hydrogen has three main isotopes; protium (1H), deuterium (2H) and tritium (3H). These isotopes form naturally in nature. Protium and deuterium are stable. Tritium is radioactive and has a half-life of about 12 years. Scientists have created four other hydrogen isotopes (4H to 7H), but these isotopes are very unstable and do not exist naturally.

The main isotopes of hydrogen are unique because they are the only isotopes that have a name. These names are still in use today. Deuterium and tritium sometimes get their own symbols, D and T. However, the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry does not like these names very much, even though they are often used. There are other isotopes that had their own names when scientists studied radioactivity. But, their names are no longer used today.

[[Crimea]]

CATEGORIES: Republic of Crimea, Autonomous areas, Geography of Ukraine, Geography of Russia, Peninsulas

Crimea, (Russian: Крым),  (Ukrainian: Крим) sometimes also called The Crimea, is a peninsula in the Black Sea that separates it from the Sea of Azov. Crimea has a surface of 26081. It is about 200 by 320. About 2.4 million people live there.

Russia took back control of Crimea in 2014, but it had been Russian for a long time. In the 18th century, the Russian Empire took control. The Crimean War was fought here. 

Crimea was part of Russia until the Soviet Union gave it to Ukraine in 1954. Ukraine gave it a limited self-rule as an autonomous republic. The seat of the government is Simferopol, which is also the biggest city. Other major cities are Sevastopol and Kerch.

In March 2014, after a series of protests in Ukraine the previous month, Russian troops took control of Crimea. A referendum was held in which over 95% of voters voted to join the Russian Federation. The Crimean Parliament quickly proclaimed independence from Ukraine and on March 18. The area became the Republic of Crimea, a federal subject of Russia. 

However, Ukraine and most other countries in the world continue to recognize Crimea as part of Ukraine. On March 24, Russia expelled from the G8 (which became the G7), and on March 27, the United Nations General Assembly passed Resolution 68/262, which states that the referendum was invalid and Crimea still belongs to Ukraine. In later months, the United States, the European Union, and other places started economic sanctions to prevent Russian people and goods from entering those countries.

DVD-Audio is an audio format similar to the CD. It is commonly claimed to have higher audio quality than the CD. DVD-Audio has not become popular due to the cost and rarity of the players, and because the traditional CD is considered good enough. Tests have shown that the traditional CD already has the highest possible audio quality. This has been mathematically proven by the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem. DVD-Audio does, however, support surround sound, and many DVD-Audio releases are available with surround sound. The traditional CD theoretically supports surround sound too, but, with the exception of DTS and Dolby Surround-encoded CDs, no surround-capable CD player has ever been made, and no surround-formatted CD has ever been released.

[[Italian Peninsula]]

CATEGORIES: Peninsulas, Regions of Europe

The Italian Peninsula or Apennine Peninsula  (Penisola italiana, Penisola appenninica) is a large peninsula of Southern Europe. It extends into the Mediterranean Sea, with the Ionian and Adriatic Seas on the east and the Tyrrhenian Sea on the west. It is located in between two larger peninsulas, the Iberian Peninsula and the Balkan Peninsula. Because of the peninsula's shape, it is nicknamed Lo Stivale ("The Boot"). Three smaller peninsulas contribute to this characteristic shape, namely Calabria (the "toe"), Salento (the "heel") and Gargano (the "spur").

The peninsula is about 1000 long, starting from the Po Valley in the north. The Apennine Mountains cover most of its length. It mainly has the Mediterranean climate, though in the mountainous parts the climate is much cooler.

Since the reign of Roman Emperor Augustus (end of 1st century BC), the northern border of the peninsula has been set on the Alps drainage basin. Geographically, however, its northern end runs from the Magra to the Rubicon rivers, north of the Apennines in Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna. This definition does not include the Po Valley or the southern slopes of the Alps.

Nearly all of the peninsula is part of the Italian Republic, apart from San Marino and the Vatican City.

[[Battle of Reading (871)]]

The Battle of Reading was fought in 871 at Reading. It was one of a series of battles between invading vikings and the Anglo-Saxons of Wessex. The viking (also called Danish) army was led by Bagsecg and Halfdan Ragnarsson. This was a large combined army. The viking army was attempting to conquer Wessex. The Wessex army was led by king Athelred of Wessex and his brother Alfred. Both the battle and the campaign it was a part of are described in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. This account provides the earliest known written record of the existence of the town of Reading. The Vikings had established a camp at Reading. The camp had several natural defenses. It was protected by the Thames and Kennet rivers on two sides, and by a rampart on the western side. Three days after their arrival, a party of Danes rode out towards nearby Englefield. There they met a West Saxon force under the command of Ealdorman Athelwulf. In the Battle of Englefield many of the Danes were killed, and the rest driven back to Reading. Four days later, Athelwulf was joined by the main West Saxon army, led by King Athelred and his brother, Alfred. The entire Saxon force marched on Reading. In the battle that followed the Vikings defeated the Wessex army and it was driven back. Aethelwulf, the ealdorman, was killed in the fighting.

[[Auditory hallucination]]

CATEGORIES: Psychosis, Medical signs

An auditory hallucination is a type of hallucination in which a person thinks they hear sounds, but the sounds are not actually there. In medical terms, it is called a paracusia. A common form involves hearing one or more voices talking. This can be a sign of some psychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia or mania. It is very important sign when deciding that a patient has one of these conditions.

People may hear voices without suffering from any specific mental illness. The causes are still being researched. The main cause of auditory hallucinations in psychotic patients is schizophrenia. The underlying problems in these cases may be genetic.

There are three main ways in which the hallucination may form: a person hearing a voice speak thoughts, a person hearing one or more voices arguing, or a person hearing a voice narrating their own actions. There can be other types of auditory hallucinations besides these three. These include hearing music playing inside the mind, usually songs that the person is familiar with. This is usually caused by damage to the brain, hearing loss or epileptic activity.

The main method of treating auditory hallucinations is antipsychotic medications that affect the body's dopamine metabolism. If the hallucinations are being caused by a mood disorder, then other medications (such as antidepressants or mood stabilizers) are often used together with the antipsychotics. These treatments may stop the hallucinations, but they are not a cure as they do not fix the cause of the problem. Some psychological therapies have been shown to help lower the intensity of the hallucinations and how often they occur.

[[Provenance]]

CATEGORIES: Words, Archaeology, Art, Paleontology

Provenance, from the French provenir, "to come from", refers to the history of ownership, or the position of a historical object. 

The term was originally used in relation to works of art. It is now used in a wide range of fields, including archaeology, paleontology, archives, manuscripts, printed books, and science and computing. The main reason to trace the provenance of an object is to get evidence of its original production or discovery. This has a special value to help authenticate objects, to prove what they are. Provenance is essentially a matter of documentation.

In archaeology the term provenience is used in related but a subtly different sense to provenance. Archaeological researchers use provenience to refer to the three-dimensional location or find spot of an artifact or feature within an archaeological site, whereas provenance covers an object's complete documented history. Ideally, in modern excavations, the provenience or find spot is recorded (even videoed) with great precision, but in older cases only the general site or approximate area may be known, especially when an artifact was found outside a professional excavation and its specific position not recorded. An object may have both a provenience (where it was found) and a provenance (where it has been since it was found). In some cases, especially where there is an inscription, the provenance may include a history that predates its burial in the ground, as well as its history after rediscovery.

[[Ice sheet]]

CATEGORIES: Landforms

An ice sheet is a large mass of glacier ice that covers an area of more than 50000. It may also be called a continental glacier. There are two ice sheets in the world at the moment: in Antarctica and Greenland.

Ice sheets are larger than ice shelves or alpine glaciers. Masses of ice covering less than 50,000 km2 are called ice caps. The ice in an ice cap usually comes from a series of glaciers that drain into it.

The Antarctic ice sheet is the largest single mass of ice on Earth. It covers an area of almost 14 million km2 and contains 30 million km3 of ice. Around 90% of the fresh water on the Earth's surface is held in this ice sheet. If all of it were to melt, it would cause sea levels to rise by 58 metres. The ice sheet first formed in the early Oligocene. It retreated and advanced many times until the Pliocene, when it came to occupy almost all of Antarctica.

The Greenland ice sheet covers about 82% of the surface of Greenland. Satellite images from NASA show that it is melting at a rate of about 239 cubic kilometres (57.3 cubic miles) each year. If all of it melted, it would cause sea levels to rise by 7.2 metres. The ice sheet did not develop at all until the late Pliocene, but apparently developed very quickly. This had the unusual effect of allowing fossils of plants that once grew on present-day Greenland to be much better preserved than with the slowly forming Antarctic ice sheet.

[[John Davis (sealer)]]

CATEGORIES: American explorers, 1784 births, People from Surrey, English explorers, People from Connecticut, Antarctica, Year of death unknown

John Davis (born in 1784 in Surrey) was an American ship captain from New Haven, Connecticut. He is thought to have been the first to land on mainland Antarctica. He is one of four explorers who share this claim. In February 1821 he may have landed a boat at Hughes Bay. The Davis Strait which separates Baffin Bay from the Labrador Sea was named by William Baffin in 1916. He probably named it after John Davis. 

On March 20, 1820, Davis left New Haven, Connecticut for a trip to the Pacific Ocean. He had received news of the discovery of the South Shetland Islands while he was anchored at the Falkland Islands. Learning there were large numbers of seals there, he and another ship captain sailed their vessels to Greenwich Island. But it was too late in the season and other sealers were there before them. So Davis took his ship, named Cecilia, in search of seals further south. Finding many seals at Low Island he continued southwards. He probably came upon Hughes Bay on the Antarctic Peninsula. His ship's log records he found "a large body of land." He sent a boat to shore to look for seals but found none. He also wrote "I think this southern land to be a continent". He also wrote in the log the latitude was 64°01'S (sixty-four degrees, one minute, south). Davis continued his journey back to Greenwich Island arriving there on 10 February, 1821. He wintered at the Falkland Islands and returned to seal hunting the following season. It remains impossible, however, to prove he was the first to reach Antarctica.

From there they could see the Allied trenches for miles in all directions. Several times the Allies tried to take it from the Germans without success. On 9 April, 1917 they attacked again. Four divisions of the Canadian Corps attacked nineteen divisions of the German 6th Army defending the ridge. The Battle was won by the Canadians on Easter Monday, 1917. It was the first time that Canadians had attacked as a national unit. However it cost the Canadians 10,602 casualties.

[[Oarfish]]

CATEGORIES: Ray-finned fish

An oarfish is a kind of very long, flat fish. "Oarfish" is another word for fish in the Regalecidae family. There are four species of oarfish in the world. The giant oarfish (Regalecus glesne) is the longest bony fish alive in the world today. It can grow up to 17 long.

Oarfish live in the pelagic zone. This means that they live in water that is not near the shore and not near the bottom of the ocean. They live in all temperate and tropical oceans. Oarfish are also very rare. They are usually only seen when a dead one washes onto the shore. When oarfish are sick or dying, they swim up near the surface of the water. This behavior means that oarfish are probably the "sea serpents" in legends.

There are two ideas about why these fish are called "oarfish." One idea is that their bodies look like oars because they are very long and flat. The other idea is that some people used to think that oarfish swam by moving their fins like the oars of a row boat. We now know that this "rowing" idea wrong. The family name Regalecidae comes from a word in regalis, which means "royal".

[[Adagio for Strings]]

CATEGORIES: Compositions

Adagio for Strings is a work by Samuel Barber. It is his most well known work. It was made for string orchestra from the second movement of his String Quartet, Op. 11. Barber finished the Adagio for Strings in 1936. It was the same year that he wrote the quartet. It was conducted by Leonard Bernstein.

It was performed for the first time in 1938, in a radio broadcast from a New York City studio. It was attended by an invited audience, conducted by Arturo Toscanini. Toscanini also took the piece on tour to Europe and South America. 

Its reviews was generally positive, with Alexander J. Morin writing that Adagio for Strings is "full of pathos and cathartic passion" and that it "rarely leaves a dry eye." The music is the setting for Barber's 1967 choral arrangement of Agnus Dei. Adagio for Strings can be heard in many TV shows and movies.

In 2004, listeners of the BBC's Today programme voted Adagio for Strings the “saddest classical” work ever.

CATEGORIES: Monsters, Festivals

A zombie walk is a trek made by people costumed as zombies. These people may also act as starving zombies. They pretend to be looking for human brains to eat. Some people create characters for themselves such as zombie brides, clowns, or mad scientists.

These walks are community events. They are sometimes held near Halloween. There are day walks and night walks. People of all ages join the walk. Sometimes professional make up artists help walkers prepare their faces. Variants on the walk format include zombie pub crawls and zombie runs. 

A walk might be held to raise money for a community concern such as local hunger. Sometimes walkers bring packaged and canned foods for the local food bank.  Zombie Walks are held around the world. They may attract thousands of zombie walkers. 

In October 2013, the annual New Jersey Zombie Walk had the largest crowd of zombies ever at 9,592. This crowd walked along the Asbury Park boardwalk. This Zombie Walk is in the Guiness World Record.

[[Integron]]

CATEGORIES: Horizontal gene transfer, Bacteria

An integron is a type of transposon, a mobile genetic element. It is a two-part genetic system found in bacteria, and maybe more widely. It is the way antibiotic resistance is passed on so rapidly. It is found in plasmids and chromosomes. Although the first function discovered was antibiotic resistance, other bacterial functions (traits) can be transferred by integrons.

Transposons are the gene "capture and expression elements" which put  the small mobile elements known as gene cassettes in place and make them work. Usually,

each cassette has only a single gene and a specific

recombination site. The cassettes carry the DNA coding (= 'a gene') for antibiotic resistance (for example). Typically, the DNA would code for an enzyme which cleaves (cuts) the antibiotic molecule up.

The first part of an integron is a gene which codes for an enzyme which captures cassettes. The second is a site on the genome where the cassettes are inserted, and a promoter which drives expression of cassette-associated genes. "Integron" describes such structures both when no cassettes are present and when there are integrated cassettes. Cassettes can be inserted at the site, they can be cut out, and they can undergo horizontal gene transfer.

Nehemiah Grew (26 September 1641spaced ndash25 March 1712) was an English plant anatomist and physiologist,  the "Father of Plant Anatomy".

Grew graduated from Pembroke College, Cambridge in 1661, and ten years later took the degree of M.D. at Leiden University. 

He began work on the anatomy of plants in 1664, and in 1670 his essay, The Anatomy of Vegetables begun, was communicated to the Royal Society. The following year he was elected a Fellow. In 1672, when the essay was published, he settled in London, and soon acquired an extensive practice as a physician. 

In 1673 he published his Idea of a Phytological History, which consisted of papers he had communicated to the Royal Society in the preceding year, and in 1677 he succeeded Henry Oldenburg as Secretary of the Royal Society. He edited the Philosophical Transactions in 1678-1679, and in 1681 he published by request a descriptive catalogue of the rarities preserved at Gresham College.

In 1682 appeared his great work on the Anatomy of Plants, which also was largely a collection of previous publications. It was illustrated with eighty-two plates, with an appendix of seven papers mostly of a chemical character. The Anatomy is especially notable for its descriptions of plant structure. He described nearly all the key differences of morphology of stem and root, showed that the flowers of the Asteraceae are built of multiple units, and correctly said that stamens are male organs. Anatomy of Plants also contains the first known microscopic description of pollen.

Much of Grew's pioneering work with the microscope was done at the same time as that of Marcello Malpighi. The two reportedly borrowed freely from one another. Grew's work on pollen was more extensive than that of Malpighi. It led to the discovery that size and shape is different between species, whereas pollen grains within a species are all alike. This discovery is central to the field of micropaleontology.

[[Paradox of thrift]]

CATEGORIES: Economics

The paradox of thrift is the idea that during a recession, people will want to save more money. But if everyone saves money, then the economy can slow down even more, reducing peoples' income as a result. It is often linked with John Maynard Keynes. It is a main theory of Keynesian economics.

It is a kind of prisoner's dilemma: saving benefits each individual but damages the general population. This is a paradox because it is contrary to intuition. Someone might think that what seems to be good for an individual in the economy will be good for the entire population. However, exercising thrift may be good for an individual by enabling that individual to save for a "rainy day", and yet not be good for the economy as a whole.

There is little agreement as to how important this is in a modern economy. Modern economies are huge, and much affected by other national economies.
