[[Designated Player Rule]]

CATEGORIES: Major League Soccer

The Designated Player Rule, nicknamed the Beckham Rule, allows Major League Soccer franchises to sign up to three players that would be considered outside their salary cap (either by offering the player higher wages or by paying a transfer fee for the player). The rule was adopted ahead of the 2007 MLS season, and it enables teams to compete for star players in the international soccer market. The rule is one of two ways which MLS teams may exceed their salary cap, the other being allocation money. As of December 2019, there have been 209 Designated Players in league history.

The rule is named after David Beckham. Beckham was the first player signed under this rule, signing a five-year contract with the Los Angeles Galaxy with a guaranteed annual salary of $6.5 million.

She was not famous in her lifetime, but she has become more well known in recent years. This is because she was one of the few women at that time who wrote essays on politics and trade. Back then, people thought those were men's areas of interest. Because of sexism, most people thought Forman's essays were written by men.

Scholars say her essays show great knowledge and morality.

[[Aluminium-26]]

CATEGORIES: Isotopes, Aluminium

Aluminium-26 (26Al, Al-26) is a radioactive isotope of aluminium. It decays by either positron emission or electron capture to magnesium-26. The half-life of 26Al is 7.17×105 years. A small amount of aluminium-26 is made when atoms hit cosmic ray protons.

When aluminium-26 decays it also produces gamma rays and x-rays. Because it is radioactive, it is usually kept behind at least 5 centimetres (2 in) of lead. We use special tools to transfer, use, and store aluminium-26.

[[Stellar nucleosynthesis]]

CATEGORIES: Nucleosynthesis, Astrophysics

Stellar nucleosynthesis is the nucleosynthesis of chemical elements by nuclear fusion reactions in stars. The theory was proposed by Fred Hoyle in 1946. Stars evolve because of changes in what they are made up of throughout their life. However, this does not by itself change the amount of elements in the universe. Later in its life, a low-mass star will slowly release its atmosphere through solar wind, forming a planetary nebula. A high-mass star will release mass through a supernova.

[[Eye of the Tiger]]

CATEGORIES: Rock ballads, 1982 songs

"Eye of the Tiger" is a 1982 hard rock song under the American rock band Survivor. This rock ballad was from the hard rock studio album of the same name.

That happened when rock group Queen didn't give him permission to use the song "Another One Bites the Dust" in his movie. The movie version had tiger growls within it.

In the United States, "Eye of the Tiger" hit #1 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. It stayed at #1 for six weeks.

The song was nominated for a 1982 Academy Award for Best Original Song. This was the only nomination for Rocky III. It lost to "Up Where We Belong" from An Officer and a Gentleman. It was also nominated for a 1983 Grammy Award for Song of the Year. It lost, though, to Willie Nelson's hit "Always on My Mind".

[[Merge sort]]

CATEGORIES: Searching and sorting algorithms

Merge sort (or mergesort) is an divide and conquer algorithm for sorting a list of items. John von Neumann first presented it in 1945. It is similar to quicksort, developed in 1960. The difference is that with merge sort,  dividing the lists is trivial, and merging them together isn't. With quicksort, dividing the lists is more complex, but the merging step is trivial.

[[Stable sorting algorithm]]

CATEGORIES: Searching and sorting algorithms

A sorting algorithm is called stable if it preserves the order of elements with the same sorting key. Otherwise it is called unstable.

Merge sort is an example of a stable sorting algorithm, quicksort is an example of an unstable sorting algorithm. 

Note that being stable has nothing to do with how difficult it is to do the sorting (known as complexity). Bubble sort is very easy to implement, but takes a very long time. It is a stable sorting algorithm.

Heapsort is very efficient, but it is not stable.

[[Heapsort]]

CATEGORIES: Searching and sorting algorithms

Heap sort or heapsort is a sorting algorithm. It was presented in 1964, and helped make a data structure known as heap popular. Heapsort divides the input into a sorted and an unsorted region. It then takes the largest element from the unsorted region and inserts it into the sorted region. The unsorted region is kept as a heap, which allows finding the largest element quickly. Heapsort is not stable. It has a worst-case complexity of O(n*log(n)).

[[Reichsbürger movement]]

CATEGORIES: Political movements, History of Germany, Politics of Germany

There are several groups of people who think that the German state is not legitimate. These movements are generally known as Reichsbürgerbewegung (Reichsbürger movement in English). A single person with such views is called Reichsbürger. Since the German state is not legitimate, its laws do not apply to them, they think. Very often, these groups are very small. Often they have several of the properties of a religious cult or sect. The ideas these groups propagate are often against democracy, and instead want a monarchy or other state with a strong leader. Very often, they also think that the history they were taught in school did not happen that way. From their ideas, these groups are usually far-right in the political spectrum. Some are holocaust deniers. Their views are often anti-semitic.  

True Reichsbürger hold the opinion that the German Empire still exists in some form (in reality, it ceased to exist with the end of World War II at the latest). According to the groups, there is some commissioned government which holds most of the powers. The respective group is usually part of that government. These movements first arose in the 1980s. Since about 2013, they are more active. They usually have some militant groups that do not fear to use violence. In 2020, there were over 19,000 people with sympathies for the movements. At least 950 people are militant right-wing activists. There are estimates from 2018, that between 2015 and mid-2017, at least 10,500 crimes were committed by people who identify as "Reichsbürger".

[[Bytecode]]

CATEGORIES: Computer programming, Programming languages

Bytecode, also termed portable code or p-code, is a form of instruction set designed for efficient execution by a software interpreter. Unlike human-readable source code, bytecodes are compact numeric codes, constants, and references (normally numeric addresses) that encode the result of compiler parsing and performing semantic analysis of things like type, scope, and nesting depths of program objects.

The name bytecode stems from instruction sets that have one-byte opcodes followed by optional parameters. Intermediate representations such as bytecode may be output by programming language implementations to ease interpretation, or it may be used to reduce hardware and operating system dependence by allowing the same code to run cross-platform, on different devices. Bytecode may often be either directly executed on a virtual machine (a p-code machine i.e., interpreter), or it may be further compiled into machine code for better performance.

Since bytecode instructions are processed by software, they may be arbitrarily complex, but are nonetheless often akin to traditional hardware instructions: virtual stack machines are the most common, but virtual register machines have been built also. Different parts may often be stored in separate files, similar to object modules, but dynamically loaded during execution.

[[Lactic acid fermentation]]

CATEGORIES: Pages with unreviewed translations, Fermentation

Lactic acid fermentation is a metabolic process  by which glucose or other monosaccharide sugars are converted into lactic acid and energy. There may also be other by-products of this fermentation. The process also works with other sugars, such as  sucrose or lactose. Lactic acid bacteria use this process to get energy. Fungi, plants and animals will also use this process, if there is a lack of oxygen. As an example, it occurs in  muscle cells. With humans, it occurs if there's too little oxygen in the blood, known as Hypoxemia.

There are different types of lactic acid fermentation:

He made his first appearance in the movie Shrek 2 (2004), soon becoming Shrek's partner and helper (alongside Donkey). In the movie Shrek the Third (2007), Puss helps Shrek find the heir to the throne of the Far Far Away Kingdom. The movie Shrek Forever After (2010) is primarily set in an alternate universe, where Puss is Princess Fiona's pet and has gained weight after his retirement. In the spin-off and prequel Puss in Boots, his origins are described. Puss also appears in the Netflix television series centered on him, The Adventures of Puss in Boots (2015–2018).

Puss was inspired by the title character of the fairy tale "Puss in Boots". His design, created by Tom Hester, was based on real cats. Several characters were used as inspirations for Puss's characterization, such as Zorro and Indiana Jones. The idea of Puss as the protagonist of a film was explored after his debut appearance. Antonio Banderas voices Puss in the English, Spanish, and Italian dubs of the Shrek franchise. While he initially tried a high-pitched voice for the character, he and the Shrek 2 filmmakers decided on a tone that was deeper than his normal voice. Banderas said that voicing Puss was an important part of his career. Eric Bauza provides Puss's voice in The Adventures of Puss in Boots.

The character is well liked, with critics praising his depiction and considering him a source of comic relief. Reviewers have regarded Puss as a popular Shrek character. Banderas's voice acting has also been praised. Merchandise inspired by the character has been produced.

[[Hellboy]]

CATEGORIES: Fictional characters introduced in 1993, Fictional demons and devils, Injustice (franchise) guest characters

Hellboy is a fictional superhero created by writer-artist Mike Mignola. The character first appeared in San Diego Comic-Con Comics #2 (August 1993), and has since appeared in various eponymous miniseries, one-shots and intercompany crossovers. The character has been adapted into three live-action feature movies. Two starring Ron Perlman in 2004 and 2008 in the title role, and one in 2019 which starred David Harbour, as well as two straight-to-DVD animated movies, and three video games – Asylum Seeker, The Science of Evil, and as a playable character in Injustice 2.

A well-meaning half-Demon (or Cambion) whose true name is Anung Un Rama ("and upon his brow is set a crown of flame"), Hellboy was summoned from Hell to Earth as a baby by Nazi occultists (spawning his hatred for the Third Reich). He was discovered on a fictional Outer Hebrides Island by the Allied Forces; amongst them, Professor Trevor Bruttenholm, who formed the United States Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense (B.P.R.D.). In time, Hellboy grew to be a large, red-skinned adult with a tail, horns (which he files off, leaving behind circular stumps on his forehead), cloven hooves for feet, and an oversized right hand made of stone (the "Right Hand of Doom"). He has been described as smelling of dry-roasted peanuts.

Hellboy works for the B.P.R.D., an international non-governmental agency, and for himself against dark forces including Nazis and witches, in a series of tales that have their roots in folklore, pulp magazines, vintage adventure, Lovecraftian horror and horror fiction. In earlier stories, he is identified as the "World's Greatest Paranormal Investigator".

In 2011, Hellboy was ranked 25th of the Top 100 Comic Book Heroes by IGN.

[[Hyperbolic functions]]

CATEGORIES: Functions and mappings, Trigonometry

In mathematics, hyperbolic functions are analogues of the ordinary trigonometric functions, but defined for the unit hyperbola rather than on the unit circle: just as the points (cos t, sin t) form a circle with a unit radius, the points (cosh t, sinh t) form the right half of the hyperbola.

Hyperbolic functions occur in the calculations of angles and distances in hyperbolic geometry. They also occur in the solutions of many linear differential equations, cubic equations, and Laplace's equation in Cartesian coordinates. Laplace's equations are important in many areas of physics.

The basic hyperbolic functions are:

from which are derived:

corresponding to the derived trigonometric functions.

The inverse hyperbolic functions are:

The hyperbolic functions take a real argument called a hyperbolic angle. The size of a hyperbolic angle is twice the area of its hyperbolic sector. The hyperbolic functions may be defined in terms of the legs of a right triangle covering this sector.

Hyperbolic functions were introduced in the 1760s independently by Vincenzo Riccati and Johann Heinrich Lambert.

[[RGB color model]]

CATEGORIES: Color model, Photography

RGB (red, green, blue) is an additive color model. In this model red, green and blue colors are added together to form a new color.

An RGB color can be made by shining three colored lights of red, green, and blue onto a white wall in a dark room. Each light has a dimmer (to regulate its intensity.)

If only the red light is on, the wall will be red. If only the green light is on, the wall will look green. If the red and green lights are on together, the wall will look yellow. Dim the red light and the wall will become more of a yellow-green.

Each setting of the three dimmers will produce a different result, either in color or in brightness or both. The set of all possible results is the gamut. Swap the red lamp for one of a different brand that is slightly more orange, and there will be a slightly different gamut, since the set of all colors that can be produced with the three lights will be changed.

The murder of Samuel Paty was a terrorist attack that took place on 16 October 2020 in Conflans-Sainte-Honorine, near Paris. Paty was a French secondary school teacher, and he was killed and then beheaded by an Islamist terrorist, Abdoullakh Abouyedovich Anzorov. Anzorov killed Paty after a "hate campaign" on social media. A student at the school where Paty taught lied about Paty's teaching, and the student's father started the hate campaign.

Paty showed his students Charlie Hebdo's 2012 cartoons showing Muhammad in a class on freedom of speech. A girl who was not in the class lied about what the teacher taught, and her father made a complaint to the police. He also started the internet "hate campaign" against Paty that caused Anzorov to kill Paty. The murder happened during the trial of other terrorists who were part of the Charlie Hebdo shooting in 2015.

The killers in the 2015 shooting were against Charlie Hebdo's 2012 cartoons showing Muhammad. After Paty showed these cartoons in a class about freedom of speech, an Islamist imam wrote a fatwa (an opinion on Muslim law) against Paty which called for his punishment. Anzorov killed Paty and put a picture of his head on Twitter. Many of Paty's students saw the picture. Anzorov said that he had "executed" Paty and addressed his words and the picture of Paty's head to Emmanuel Macron, the president of the French Republic. The police shot Anzorov dead a few minutes after the murder.

President Macron said that the event was "a typical Islamist terrorist attack", and that "our compatriot was killed for teaching children freedom of speech".

CATEGORIES: 1762 births, 1806 deaths, French Revolution, French diplomats, French generals

Thomas-Alexandre Dumas became France’s first black general in 1793. This was the period of the French Revolutionary Wars, marked by political extremism and atrocities. Yet Dumas won a reputation as a humane commander, who allegedly once had a guillotine taken down and burnt, claiming his men were short of firewood. In 1796 he was sent to Italy to serve under Napoleon Bonaparte, but the two men did not get on.

Dumas objected to the looting of Italian towns, which Napoleon generally tolerated. But Dumas proved his skill as a military leader, defeating the Austrians several times, who nicknamed him ‘the Black Devil’. In 1797, while suffering intense grief at recent news of the death of his infant daughter, Dumas captured a crucial bridge, then single-handedly held it against an Austrian cavalry squadron, receiving two sabre wounds.

His aide-de-camp described the scene: “I managed to turn toward the general; he was standing at the head of the bridge of Clausen and holding it alone against the whole squadron; and as the bridge was narrow and the men could only get at him two or three abreast, he cut down as many as came at him.” Even Napoleon was won over, nicknaming Dumas ‘the Horatius of the Tyrol’, after the hero who saved Rome.

Napoleon promoted Dumas and rewarded him with a pair of pistols from the armoury at Versailles, to replace those he’d lost at the bridge.

The material returned is expected to enable scientists to learn more about the formation and evolution of the Solar System, its initial stages of planet formation, and the source of organic compounds that led to the formation of life on Earth. 

If successful, OSIRIS-REx will be the first United States spacecraft to return samples from an asteroid.

[[Launch on warning]]

CATEGORIES: Nuclear weapons

Launch on warning (LOW) is a strategy of using nuclear weapons that gained recognition during the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union. Launch on warning became an important part of mutually assured destruction (MAD) theory as a result of the invention of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). Under the LOW strategy, nuclear weapons are launched as retaliation upon receiving warning signs of an enemy nuclear attack, even while the incoming missiles are still in the air and before detonation occurs. U.S. land-based missiles can reportedly be launched

within five minutes of a presidential decision to do so, and submarine-based missiles can be launched within 15 minutes.

[[Code talker]]

CATEGORIES: World War II, Military tactics, Cryptography, Human communication

A code talker was a person who was hired by the United States military during wartime to use a little-known language as a means of secret communication. The term is now usually known with United States service members during the world wars who used their knowledge of Native American languages.

About 400 to 500 Native Americans in the United States Marine Corps whose primary job was to transmit secret tactical messages. 

The code talkers improved the speed of encryption and decryption of communications in front line operations during World War II.

Native soldiers developed two types of Native American Code Talking (NACT). First developed by Choctaw in World War I, Type one NACT contained coded vocabulary, collections of words or phrases that were assigned to military subjects, within their languages. Type two NACT simply used existing Native languages. Both forms worked as codes because they were based on languages unknown to the enemy and, as the new codes were not based on mathematical processes as found in most code and cipher systems, the enemy had nothing to which to compare them.

During World War II, Comanche soldiers created about 250 coded terms, while Navajo soldiers eventually developed more than 700 terms. Many terms were based on everyday things in the tribal communities such as animals, food, material items and descriptions. Examples of code terms include the Comanche terms for tank (“wakaree’e” or “turtle”) and telephone exchange (“puhihwi tekwapu kahni” or “metal talking house”); the Hopi terms for ship (“pa-a-ki-hu” or “houses on water”) and the M-1 rifle (mouth and one); and the Navajo term for grenade (“ni-ma-si” or “potatoes”). A 1941 edition of the journal “The Masterkey” reports that one of the tribes in the Chippewa and Oneida group developed terms based on the colors of military hat cords and other insignia, with the Native word for “blue” meaning infantry, “yellow” meaning cavalry and “red” for artillery. The Comanche even had a code name for Adolf Hitler—“Po’sa taiboo’” (Crazy White Man). Hopi, Meskwaki and Canadian Cree also had specially devised code terms, although the number is unknown.

Eight Hopi code talkers were in the 81st Division. Although Frank Chapella, Franklin Shupla and Warren Koopyaquaptewa were all from the village of Tewa, they were both Tewa and Hopi and so spoke both of these tribes’ languages. Frank Chapella’s wife, Elidia Chapella, and his son, Marshall Shupla, recall how these three individuals spoke to one another in Tewa (their matrilineal classification through their mothers) and in Hopi with the other five members of their unit.

Some Type one NACT groups like the Comanche and Navajo also developed alphabet systems, using the first letter of English words translated from Native words to spell out names of individuals and locations. For example, the translation of the Comanche words for pear, ant, rain, ice and snake could be combined to convey “Paris.” While the Comanche used an open system by using any word that translated to the desired letter, the Navajo developed a set vocabulary, such as “wol-la-chee” (ant) for the letter a, “shush” (bear) for b, “moasi” (cat) for c and so on. Later they developed three interchangeable words for each English letter. Both systems prevented repetition and inhibited breaking of the code.

One of the benefits of using these codes derived from Native language was open-air messages could be sent faster, often in one to two minutes compared to existing encryption methods requiring up to four hours to craft, communicate and decode. NACT messages were typically brief—usually less than three lines—to avoid creating radio congestion, drawing enemy attention, providing repetition or giving the enemy more transmissions to analyze. “Whenever we sent a message it was short, sweet and to the point,” Comanche code talker Roderick Red Elk noted.

Because of the speed of their communications, code talkers were especially important in relaying information and conveying orders that needed immediate implementation or response, such as troop movement, enemy resistance, evacuation of wounded and directing artillery, ammunition and other supplies. “It was in these defensive positions where you used it quite a bit,” Comanche code talker Forrest Kassanavoid said. “All critical information, something they felt was really top secret, was in Comanche.”

During 1943 and 1944, U.S. Army, Navy and Marine Corps representatives considered increasing their numbers of American Indian code talkers. However, Army and Navy leaders were skeptical the code talkers’ messages were secure and decided not to expand their units. The Marine Corps expressed optimism but kept silent about its growing program.

Despite these decisions, several Army and Army Air Forces units each had small groups of Native communicators. In the Pacific, seven Lakota soldiers in the 302nd Reconnaissance Troop became known as “MacArthur’s Boys,” while the 5th Bomb Command in the 5th Army Air Force had a radio net of 15 Native Americans who sent radio communications in Acoma-Laguna, Apache, Crow, Hopi, Lakota and other Native languages. In the Pacific, the Navajo, the largest group of code talkers, served in every major campaign, from the battle on Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands from August 1942 to February 1943 to the conflicts on Okinawa, which lasted from April to June 1945.

[[Acoustic foam]]

CATEGORIES: Materials

Acoustic foam is a type of foam used for acoustic treatment. It makes sound waves in the air weaker, thereby reducing their amplitude. It is used to reduce or control noise. Acoustic foams are typically softer and more lightweight than their sound blocking foams. The open and flexible cell structure of acoustic foam acts as a natural soundwave absorber and prevents noises from reverberating off hard surfaces like walls, floors and ceilings. It does this by converting existing sound energy to heat and reducing the ability of soundwaves to bounce back into the room. Depending on how it’s used, this type of foam can also enhance the acoustics within a room. Sound absorbing foam cut into pyramid or wedge shapes can be used to manipulate vibrations in a way that improves sound quality.

Acoustic foam can be attached to walls, ceilings, doors, and other places in a room to control noise levels, vibration, and echoes.

Many acoustic foam products are treated with dyes and/or fire retardants.

[[Aging in cats]]

CATEGORIES: Cats

Reliable information on the lifespans of house cats is hard to find. However, research has been done to get an estimate (an educated guess) on how long cats usually live. Cats usually live for 13 to 20 years. Sometimes cats can live for 22 to 30 years but there are claims of cats dying at ages of more than 30 years old.

The Guinness World Record for the oldest cat was for a cat named Creme Puff, who was 38 years old. Female cats seem to live longer than male cats. Neutered cats live longer than cats that have not been neutered. Mixed breed cats also appear to live longer than purebred cats. Researchers have also found that cats that weigh more have shorter lifespans.

People sometimes guess how long a cat will live by comparing it to how long a human usually lives. You can estimate a cat's age in "cat years" by multiplying the cat's age in normal years by 7. A better guess for cat years used by veterinarians is: the cat's age times 4, then plus 16. You can use this math for cats who are at least 2 years old.

This is an example of both ways of estimating cat years for a 5 year old cat:

The life expectancy of an indoor cat is around 17 years, but the life expectancy of outdoor cats is 5.6 years.

Diop kept doing activism back in Senegal. He, his brothers, and his friends wanted to have a revolution there, because they felt Leopold Senghor's government helped the French more than it helped Senegalese people and it was neocolonial. Diop started doing theatre in public to promote revolutionary ideas. They got ready to start a guerrilla war against Senegal's government, but they were arrested and sent to prison on an island called Gorée. Diop died in prison in 1973. Many people who knew him, including his family, think he was secretly killed by the government.

[[Non-Profit Industrial Complex]]

CATEGORIES: Activism, Non-profit organizations

Non-profit industrial complex, or "NPIC" for short, is a term which is used by social justice activists to describe the way non-profit organizations, governments, and businesses are related.

Many activists carry out their work as employees of or with the assistance of non-profit organizations. Many of their goals need money in order to be achieved, and nonprofits are registered with the government in order to be allowed to receive large amounts of money legally. These activist nonprofits usually get money from even bigger nonprofits, which are connected to big businesses and rich people who control industries. But because many activists criticize things in society that businesses and rich people support, they might not get the money if they are too critical. So in order to stay funded, they may have to change the ideas they have for improving society to be more acceptable to industry.

People who believe these kinds of relationships between activists and industries are harmful to activism use the term non-profit industrial complex as a faster way to discuss these relationships, instead of explaining the whole system each time. They have written many articles and books describing the effects of the NPIC by studying patterns of funding or discussing how the goals of some activists changed once their movements began to receive more money.

[[Timeline of the far future]]

CATEGORIES: Time, Science

The ultimate fate of our universe may be the heat death of the universe. Before that happens, it is possible to predict that the following will happen.

Some types of science can say what could happen far into the future. Before we go further, it is worth noting that our local group of galaxies are bound by gravitation, and its changes and aging can be discussed separate from the rest of the universe.

For example, astrophysics can say how planets and stars form, affect each other, and die; particle physics can say how atoms and other matter act over time; evolutionary biology can allow us to see how living things change over time; and plate tectonics can say how continents shift over time.  By observing the past and present, astrophysicists, particle physicists, evolutionary biologists and geologists can make guesses about what might happen in the future. 

The second law of thermodynamics is important to predictions about the future of Earth, of the Solar System, and the future of the expanding universe. The second law of thermodynamics says that entropy is always happening.  That means that the universe is slowly running out of the kind of energy that can do work. For example, stars will eventually run out of hydrogen fuel and burn out.

[[High roll]]

CATEGORIES: Hairstyles, Fashion

A high roll is a hairstyle that Western women wore in the late 1700s.

The style took hours to make.  Sometimes, a professional hairdresser would style the woman's hair.  That meant the woman had to be rich enough to pay a hairdresser and to spend hours sitting in a chair not working.  This made the high roll a status symbol.

The hairstyle could be very tall and make a person's head seem twice as high. First, the woman's hair would be combed.  Then the woman or her hairdresser would add pomatum to the hair so it could be shaped.  The pomatum would have treated fat, oil and perfumes or spices in it. This would make the hair smell good, kill headlice, and help hold the hair in place. Women would add extra hair collected from cows, horses, or other people. Or they would collect from their own hairbrushes over time and reuse it.  Women and hairdressers would use small pillows inside the hair to hold it up.  Some women would make curls along the sides or neck with curlers.  The hair was held in place with pins.  The hair could be natural color or colored gray, brown or white with powder. Some women, for example, Queen Marie Antoinette of France, would wear feathers, jewelry, or sculptures of plants and animals in their high hair. Some women said that it would itch.

[[Options Clearing Corporation]]

CATEGORIES: Finance, Companies based in Chicago, Illinois

Options Clearing Corporation (also called "OCC") is a United States clearing house based in Chicago.  Clearing houses are used to help traders, and they make sure each trade is correctly made, or "cleared". The OCC does this "clearing" with stocks, stock options, and many things that are very much like options (called equity derivatives).  "Clearing" for stocks is very much like clearing a bank check.  The OCC provides this service to at least 14 exchanges, where stocks, options, and contracts to buy or sell copper, gold, grain, oil, and other needed supplies.  They also provide services for people and companies that need to borrow stocks.  When someone borrows a stock, they have to pay OCC some money every day.  This is the same as people who pay a bank for a loan of money.

Like all clearing houses, the OCC makes sure that nobody cheats, and they check everything to be sure that it is working.  The OCC has about $100 billion US dollars of money deposited by big banks and trading companies (or "members").  Each day, the big banks and trading companies use the OCC to trade billions of dollars worth of stocks and other equity derivatives.  In 2015, they had 4.2 billion trades.  That was the third highest in their history.

In 2011, OCC was the largest clearing house in the USA.

[[Emancipation reform of 1861]]

CATEGORIES: History of Russia

The Emancipation Reform of 1861 in Russia, also known as the Emancipation Edict of Russia, (Krestyanskaya reforma 1861 goda – "peasants' reform of 1861") was the first and most important of the liberal reforms passed during the reign (1855–1881) of Emperor Alexander II of Russia. The reform effectively abolished serfdom throughout the Russian Empire.

The 1861 Emancipation Manifesto proclaimed the emancipation of the serfs on private estates and of the domestic (household) serfs. By this edict more than 23 million people received their liberty. Serfs gained the full rights of free citizens, including rights to marry without having to gain consent, to own property and to own a business. The Manifesto prescribed that peasants would be able to buy the land from the landlords. Household serfs were the least affected: they gained only their freedom and no land.

In Georgia the emancipation took place later, in 1864, and on much better terms for the nobles than in Russia. The serfs were emancipated in 1861, after a speech given by Tsar Alexander II on 30 March 1856. State owned serfs, i.e., those living on Imperial lands, were emancipated later, in 1866.

[[Hurricane Eta]]

CATEGORIES: 2020 disasters, 2020 in North America, Hurricanes, November 2020 events

Hurricane Eta was a Category 4 hurricane that caused a lot of damage for parts of Central America in early November 2020. Eta originated from a tropical wave in the eastern Caribbean Sea on October 31. The system organized very quickly as it moved west, and the cyclone peaked as a Category 4 hurricane on November 3. Some weakening took place as the system made landfall near Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua, late that same day. Eta quickly weakened to a tropical depression as it slowly moved across Central America before moving north into the Caribbean, also quickly moved toward Cuba on November 7. Over the next five days, the system moved very oddly, moving through the Florida Keys, before moving into the southern Gulf of Mexico. Reaching hurricane strength for a short time, it weakened once more and quickly moved across the Southeastern United States on November 12. It dissipated the next day.

Hurricane and tropical storm watches and warnings happened along the coast of Honduras and Northeastern Nicaragua as Eta approached. More than 10,000 people went to shelters in Puerto Cabezas and nearby villages. Eta knocked down power lines and trees while damaging roofs and causing flooding in Puerto Cabezas. At least 178 deaths across Central America have been related to the storm. Once the system began to reorganize in the Caribbean, tropical storm watches were in effect on November 5, in the Cayman Islands. In Cuba, the Bahamas, and South Florida, more areas were under watches. Eta brought heavy rainfall and gusty winds to the Cayman Islands and Cuba. Southern Florida had evacuations because of Eta and other floods. Eta's second landfall brought storm surge and gusty winds to the west coast of Central Florida and much needed rainfall to northern Florida. A cold front further to the north worsened this, bringing heavy rainfall and flash flooding to the Carolinas and Virginia, killing another five people in these states. 11 deaths were related to the storm in the U.S. Nearly $8 billion in damages have been reported across all affected areas by Eta as of December 2020.

Relief efforts for those affected by the storm were set up in several countries. About 2.5 million were affected by the storm, including 1.7 million in Honduras. Many Emergency Response Units were to help support affected people. About 100 tons of food and water were given to Nicaragua and Honduras from Panama. People left homeless were moved to many shelters after the storm had passed. Donations worth millions of USD had been given to affected countries to help recoveries. However, just two weeks later, all efforts were reversed by Hurricane Iota.

[[Force play]]

CATEGORIES: Baseball rules, Sports words

In baseball, any player from the team that is trying to score who is on one of the bases (a runner) can not be safe on that base anymore if there is another player from their team who has become unsafe at the previous base in the same way; the runner is then said to be forced to run. The batter can be considered as no longer being safe at home base (which can be thought of as the base that comes "before" first base) when he has hit the ball into the fair part of the field. A forceout occurs when a player on the fielding team touches a base while holding the ball and a runner at the previous base was made unsafe in this way; that runner is then out.

In other words, a runner is forced to run to the next base, with the risk of being out if an opponent holding the ball touches the next base before them, in only the following two situations:

If, during the play, a runner is gotten out, and there are other runners who are not out and currently forced to run, then any of those runners that reached a base that came after the base(s) touched by the runner that got out is no longer forced to run. This is called "removing the force".

[[Henet]]

CATEGORIES: Egyptian gods and goddesses, Mythology

Henet or the Pelican is an Ancient Egyptian goddess.  She has to do with pelicans. The Pyramid Texts talk about Henet.

The Pelican (Henet in Egyptian) is shown on the walls of tombs of people from the Pharaoh's court.  Henet is in scenes of farm animals. Henet is in royal funerary texts from the Pyramid Age as a protective symbol against snakes. The description of the Pelican falling into the Nile seems connected with the idea that dangerous things are disguised as fish, and the pelican will capture them in its large beak.  This is similar to the dragnets and bird nets used for trapping sinners in the Underworld. Scholars think that Henet is a goddess because she is called "mother of the king" in the Pyramid Texts. In ancient Egypt, that only meant a goddess.

In non-royal funerary papyri the Pelican can predict safe travel for a dead person in the Underworld. The open beak of the Pelican is also associated with the ability of the deceased to leave the burial chamber and go out into the rays of the sun, possibly an analogy made between the long cavernous beak of the pelican and the tomb shaft.

[[Amendment process]]

CATEGORIES: Amendments to the United States Constitution

The authority to amend the Constitution of the United States is derived from Article V of the Constitution. After Congress proposes an amendment, the Archivist of the United States, who heads the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), is charged with responsibility for administering the ratification process under the provisions of 1 U.S.C. 106b. The Archivist has delegated many of the ministerial duties associated with this function to the Director of the Federal Register. Neither Article V of the Constitution nor section 106b describe the ratification process in detail. The Archivist and the Director of the Federal Register follow procedures and customs established by the Secretary of State, who performed these duties until 1950, and the Administrator of General Services, who served in this capacity until NARA assumed responsibility as an independent agency in 1985.

The Constitution provides that an amendment may be proposed either by the Congress with a two-thirds majority vote in both the House of Representatives and the Senate or by a constitutional convention called for by two-thirds of the State legislatures. None of the 27 amendments to the Constitution have been proposed by constitutional convention. The Congress proposes an amendment in the form of a joint resolution. Since the President does not have a constitutional role in the amendment process, the joint resolution does not go to the White House for signature or approval. The original document is forwarded directly to NARA's Office of the Federal Register (OFR) for processing and publication. The OFR adds legislative history notes to the joint resolution and publishes it in slip law format. The OFR also assembles an information package for the States which includes formal "red-line" copies of the joint resolution, copies of the joint resolution in slip law format, and the statutory procedure for ratification under 1 U.S.C. 106b.

The Archivist submits the proposed amendment to the States for their consideration by sending a letter of notification to each Governor along with the informational material prepared by the OFR. The Governors then formally submit the amendment to their State legislatures or the state calls for a convention, depending on what Congress has specified. In the past, some State legislatures have not waited to receive official notice before taking action on a proposed amendment. When a State ratifies a proposed amendment, it sends the Archivist an original or certified copy of the State action, which is immediately conveyed to the Director of the Federal Register. The OFR examines ratification documents for facial legal sufficiency and an authenticating signature. If the documents are found to be in good order, the Director acknowledges receipt and maintains custody of them. The OFR retains these documents until an amendment is adopted or fails, and then transfers the records to the National Archives for preservation.

A proposed amendment becomes part of the Constitution as soon as it is ratified by three-fourths of the States (38 of 50 States). When the OFR verifies that it has received the required number of authenticated ratification documents, it drafts a formal proclamation for the Archivist to certify that the amendment is valid and has become part of the Constitution. This certification is published in the Federal Register and U.S. Statutes at Large and serves as official notice to the Congress and to the Nation that the amendment process has been completed.

In a few instances, States have sent official documents to NARA to record the rejection of an amendment or the rescission of a prior ratification.

[[Three-Fifths Compromise]]

CATEGORIES: History of the United States, United States Constitution

In 1878, the US constitutional convention looked at the problem of counting its population. The population of a state determines the influence a state can take in a presidential election. The convention also looked at the problem of counting slaves: If they were counted, the state would have more power in the election, the taxes the state would have to pay to the government would also be higher. The Three-Fifths Compromise was that three out of every five slaves would be counted.  The compromise of counting "all other persons" as only three-fifths of their actual numbers reduced the representation of the slave states relative to the original proposals, but improved it over the Northern position. An inducement for slave states to accept the Compromise was its tie to taxation in the same ratio, so that the burden of taxation on the slave states was also reduced.

A contentious issue at the 1787 Constitutional Convention was whether slaves would be counted as part of the population in determining representation of the states in the Congress or would instead be considered property and, as such, not be considered for purposes of representation. Delegates from states with a large population of slaves argued that slaves should be considered persons in determining representation, but as property if the new government were to levy taxes on the states on the basis of population. Delegates from states where slavery had become rare argued that slaves should be included in taxation, but not in determining representation.

The proposed ratio was, however, a ready solution to the problem that arose during the Constitutional Convention. In amending the Articles, the North wanted slaves to count for more than the South did because the objective was to determine taxes paid by the states to the federal government. In the Constitutional Convention, the more important issue was representation in Congress, so the South wanted slaves to count for more than the North did.397

[[Egoism]]

CATEGORIES: Ethics, Philosophical movements and positions

Egoism is a philosophy about people serving their own needs or wants. Some kinds of egoism say that everything people do is egoistic, meaning it is done to serve their own desires. Other kinds of egoism instead say that people should do whatever they want or whatever benefits themselves.

Egoism is often seen as the opposite of altruism, meaning the concern for others. "Altruism" is a word created by the French thinker Auguste Comte, who says that people must only serve each other and never be egoistic. The German thinker Friedrich Nietzsche instead says that altruism is not the opposite of egoism. He also says that even though people say altruism is good, they do not treat each other well very much at all. Other egoists also often criticise this kind of attitude against people who do what benefits themselves. But Nietzsche says that people should eventually leave both altruism and egoism behind.

The American researcher James Scanlan says that when people do whatever benefits themselves it is only a fake kind of egoism. And that real egoism is when people do whatever they want. Both are often seen as dangerous beliefs. Some egoists such as Max Stirner, Nikolay Chernyshevsky, and Dmitry Pisarev, are also thought of as nihilists. And the British egoist Aleister Crowley popularised the phrase "Do what thou will".

[[Life-affirming]]

CATEGORIES: Philosophical concepts

If something is life-affirming it means it has a positive and healthy attitude towards living. It is the opposite of being "life-denying". To affirm means to agree or to say something is good.

This is also called "Nietzschean affirmation" after the German thinker Friedrich Nietzsche. Nietzsche wrote that a person is life-affirming only if they affirm life the way it is. This means to love their life even when it hurts or isn't comfortable. Nietzsche wrote that the best people will say yes to living, even if they would have to live the exact same life on Earth over and over. He wrote that if anyone truly affirms even just one moment then they affirm everything in life. If someone "has trembled with happiness and sounded like a harp string just once, all eternity was needed to produce this one event—and in this single moment of affirmation all eternity was called good, redeemed, justified, and affirmed." According to Nietzsche, Christians are not life-affirming.

[[Snow in Florida]]

CATEGORIES: Florida, Snow

The U.S. state Florida does not get snow very often. Most of the time, major cities in Florida do not get snowfall that can be measured. Some areas in the far north are able to get snow more often. The National Weather Service says that the Florida Keys and Key West have not gotten a snow flurry in more than 300 years. In Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and Palm Beach, only one snow flurry was recorded. This happened in January 1977. Miami, Fort Lauderdale, or Palm Beach have not had a snow flurry before or after that.

Florida's climate is low latitude and subtropical. Temperatures that are cold enough to have snowfall do not happen long. Frost is more likely to happen than snow because it needs a temperature of 32°F or 0°C, less than 2 m or 7 ft above sea level, no clouds in the sky, and a relative humidity of 65% or more. For snow to happen in Florida, a polar jet stream must go south through Texas and the Gulf of Mexico. A cold front has to stop around the south part of Florida and curve northeast to add very cold air into clouds.

The earliest known time Florida got snow was in 1774. People in Florida thought it was "extraordinary white rain." The first White Christmas in the northeast part of Florida was on December 23, 1989.

CATEGORIES: November 2020 events, Hurricanes

Hurricane Iota was a devastating late-season Category 4 Atlantic hurricane which caused severe damage to areas of Central America already devastated by Hurricane Eta just less than two weeks prior. The 31st and final tropical cyclone, 30th named storm, 14th hurricane, and record-tying seventh major hurricane of the record-breaking 2020 Atlantic hurricane season, Iota originated as a tropical wave that moved into the Eastern Caribbean on November 10. Over the next few days, the wave began to become better organized and by November 13, it developed into a tropical depression north of Colombia. The depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Iota six hours later. The storm was initially impacted by some wind shear, but a center relocation and relaxed shear allowed Iota to quickly strengthen into a hurricane on November 15, after which it underwent explosive intensification, peaking at Category 5 with wind speeds of 160 mph (257 km/h), operationally. However, the peak was adjusted down to a 155 mph (249 km/h) high-end Category 4 in post-season analysis. After weakening slightly, Iota made landfall in northeastern Nicaragua as a high-end Category 4 hurricane, becoming the strongest recorded hurricane to make landfall in Nicaragua in November. Iota then rapidly weakened as it moved inland, dissipating on November 18, the storm killed 61 people and 41 were reported missing during the storm

[[Maria Reynolds]]

CATEGORIES: 1768 births, 18th century in the United States

Maria Reynolds was a woman who lived in the 1700s.  She is famous for having an affair with Alexander Hamilton.

In 1791, when Maria Reynolds was 23, she went to Alexander Hamilton's house in Philadelphia.  She said her husband had left and she wanted to go back to New York, where she was from.  He offered to lend her money so she could go.  Instead, the two of them began a sexual relationship.  Later, Maria Reynolds' husband, James Reynolds, blackmailed Alexander Hamilton: He told Hamilton to give him money or else he would tell Hamilton's wife that he had slept with Maria. Hamilton paid James Reynolds and continued to visit Maria Reynolds.

James Reynolds continued to write letters to Hamilton asking for money, and Hamilton paid.  When James Reynolds was arrested for forgery, he asked Hamilton for help.  Hamilton did not help.  James Reynolds told Hamilton's political enemies, Democratic Republicans James Monroe, Frederick Muhlenberg, and Abraham Venable about the affair.  He also said Hamilton had committed other crimes.  Monroe, Muhlenberg and Venable talked to Hamilton.  They believed he had had an affair but had not committed other crimes.  But Monroe made a copy of letters Hamilton's had written to Maria Reynolds and gave it to Thomas Jefferson.

In 1796, James Callendar wrote a book called The History of the United States for 1796.  In that book, he accused Hamilton of speculation and of the affair.  Hamilton wrote a pamphlet called Observations on Certain Documents in 1797.  He said in the pamphlet that he had had the affair but had not done any speculation.  The public believed him.

Later, Maria Reynolds sued her husband for divorce.  Aaron Burr was her lawyer.

A fictional Maria Reynolds appears in act II of the Broadway musical Hamilton.

[[Taihō Code]]

CATEGORIES: Government, History of Japan

The Taihō Code was a group of laws in Japan.  It was the law during the 700s c.e., which was the Nara period in Japan. Here, "code" means "set of rules."

The Taihō Code had two kinds of laws.  It had ritsu which were laws about crime and how to arrest people.  It had ryō, which were laws about how to run the government.  For example, the ryō said which areas were provinces and who would run them and what things the governors were and were not allowed to do.

The lawmakers who wrote the Taihō Code copied things from Chinese laws.  This was the Tang Dynasty in China.  But the Japanese lawmakers wrote the Taihō Code to give more government jobs to Japanese noblemen.  This was different from the Tang Dynasty laws, which said anyone from any family could work for the government if they took and passed the right tests.

Modern scholars do not have a copy of the entire Taihō Code, but they think it is about the same as the later Yōrō Code.

If the Taihō Code and the Yōrō Code count as the same thing, then they lasted from 702 c.e. until the start of the Tokugawa period in 1232 c.e.

[[Dashavatar]]

CATEGORIES: Hinduism

The Dashavatara refers to the ten Primary incarnations of Lord Vishnu, the god of preservation. Vishnu is said to descend in the form of an avatar to restore balance in the world.

The list of included avatars varies across sects and regions.  All avatars have appeared except Kalki, who will appear at the end of the Kali Yuga.

The order of the ancient concept of Dashavataras has been interpreted to be reflective of modern Darwinian evolution- it is the theory of evolution told as a story, written between 12-14,000 years ago. It describes the cycle of human evolution beginning in water as Matsya the fish, on to the amphibious phase (half land and water) as Koorma, the tortoise, on to begin firmly established on land as the wild boar Varaha, then Narsimha- half man- half animal, followed by Vamana, the Dwarf man, on to Parashurama, the emotionally volatile man, on to Rama, the peaceful man, then Krishna, a loving man followed by Buddha, the meditative man, who is said to be succeeded by the final incarnation of Vishnu, or the last stage of evolution as Kalki, the mystical man. This is thus also a description of the evolution of consciousness

[[Limba noastră]]

CATEGORIES: National anthems, Romanian culture

"Deșteaptă-te, române!" (deʃˈte̯aptəte roˈmɨne; variously translated as "Awaken thee, Romanian!", "Awaken, Romanian!", or "Wake up, Romanian!") is the national anthem of Romania.

The lyrics were composed by Andrei Mureșanu (1816–1863) and the music was popular (it was chosen for the poem by Gheorghe Ucenescu, as most sources say). It was written and published during the 1848 revolution, initially with the name "Un răsunet" ("An echo"). It was first sung in late June in the same year in the city of Brașov, on the streets of the Șcheii Brașovului neighborhood. It was immediately accepted as the revolutionary anthem and renamed "Deșteaptă-te, române!"

Since then, this song, which contains a message of liberty and patriotism, has been sung during all major Romanian conflicts, including during the 1989 anti-communist revolution. After the revolution, it became the national anthem on 24 January 1990, replacing the communist-era national anthem "Trei culori" ("Three colors").

July 29 is now the "National Anthem Day" (Ziua Imnului național), an annual observance in Romania.

The song was also used on various solemn occasions in the Moldavian Democratic Republic during its brief existence between 1917 and 1918. Furthemore, between 1991 and 1994, Deșteaptă-te, române! also was the national anthem of Moldova, but it was subsequently replaced by the current Moldovan anthem, "Limba noastră" ("Our language").

[[Romanian alphabet]]

CATEGORIES: Alphabets

The Romanian alphabet is a variant of the Latin alphabet used by the Romanian language. It is a modification of the classical Latin alphabet and consists of 31 letters. Five of the letters (Ă, Â, Î, Ș, and Ț) have been changed from their Latin originals for the phonetic requirements of the language:

The letters Q (chiu), W (dublu v), and Y (igrec or i grec) were formally introduced in the Romanian alphabet in 1982, although they had been used earlier. They occur only in foreign words and their Romanian derivatives, such as quasar, watt, and yacht. The letter K, although relatively older, is also rarely used and appears only in proper names and international neologisms such as kilogram, broker, karate. These four letters are still perceived as foreign, which explains their usage for stylistic purposes in words such as nomenklatură (normally nomenclatură, meaning "nomenclature", but sometimes spelled with k instead of c if referring to members of the Communist leadership in the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc countries, as Nomenklatura is used in English).

In cases where the word is a direct borrowing having diacritical marks not present in the above alphabet, official spelling tends to favor their use (München, Angoulême etc., as opposed to the use of Istanbul over İstanbul).

[[S-comma]]

CATEGORIES: Pterosaurs, Animals of Europe

Hatzegopteryx ("Hațeg basin wing") is a genus of azhdarchid pterosaur. It was found in Transylvania, Romania. It is known only from the type species, Hatzegopteryx thambema, named in 2002 based on parts of the skull and humerus. Additional fossils, including a neck vertebra, were included later. The largest of these remains shows that the Hatzegopteryx was one of the biggest pterosaurs, with an estimated wingspan of 10.

It is unusual because it had a very wide skull with large muscular attachments. The bones had a soft internal texture instead of being hollow. it had a short, robust, and heavily muscled neck 1.5 long. This short neck was about half the length of other azhdarchids. The neck could withstand strong bending forces. Hatzegopteryx lived on Hațeg Island, an island in the Cretaceous subtropics within the prehistoric Tethys Sea. It was probably the apex predator of Hațeg Island, tackling larger prey (including dwarf titanosaurs and iguanodontians) than other azhdarchids.

[[History of the Jews in Canada]]

CATEGORIES: Canadian Jews

The history of the Jews in Canada is the history of Canadian citizens who follow Judaism as their religion and/or are ethnically Jewish. Jewish Canadians are a part of the greater Jewish diaspora and form the fourth largest Jewish community in the world, exceeded only by those in Israel, the United States, and France.jppistudy As of 2011, Statistics Canada listed 329,500 followers of the Jewish religion in Canada and 309,650 who claimed Jewish as an ethnicity. One does not necessarily include the other and studies which have attempted to combine the two numbers have arrived at figures above 375,000 Jews in Canada. This total would be approximately 1.1% of the Canadian population.

The Jewish community in Canada is composed mainly of Ashkenazi Jews and their descendants. Several other major Jewish ethnic divisions are also represented. These include Sephardi Jews, Mizrahi Jews, and Bene Israel from India, besides converts to Judaism. The Canadian community has all four of the main modern denominations of Judaism. Many religious and cultural customs are observed.

Though they are a small minority of the total Canadian population, Jews have been present in the country since the first Jewish immigrants arrived with Governor Edward Cornwallis to establish Halifax, Nova Scotia (1749).

[[Elu (Portuguese pronoun)]]

CATEGORIES: Pronouns, Gender, Language

EluThe Elu'' system''' (sistema elu) is based on a set of linguistic proposals created with the purpose of preparing the Portuguese language with a neuter grammatical gender. The most prominent proposal is the personal neopronouns elu, delu, nelu, and daquelu', intended to be a proposal for how to refer to non-binary people (whose gender identity is not male or female) or whose gender is unknown, or irrelevant, as well as groups with different genders, without resorting to the "generic masculine". These proposals can be used by and for anyone, regardless of gender.

The pronoun elu tries to present the least number of problems in its use when trying to function smoothly in oral speech, listening, writing and visual identification, creating similarity between ela ("she"), ele ("he"), and elu (functionally similar to singular they).

Nouns in Portuguese all have grammatical gender, and this gender impacts some grammatical inflections. Grammatical gender is different from personal gender identity―rather, words referring to a generic individual with unknown gender identity still carries grammatical gender. For example, the word pessoa ("person") is grammatically feminine, but indicates no specific gender of the person referred to. The gender inflection appears explicitly when in the context of an inflectied adjective. With the feminine nouns such as cidade ("city"; plural cidades), the adjective meaning "beautiful" (currently written generically as belo in dictionaries) would become cidade bela, cidades belas ("beautiful city/cities"). Likewise, this works with a masculine noun such as carro ("car"; plural carros): carro belo, carros belos ("beautiful car/cars").

The Portuguese language as a rule determines that the plural of nouns, when covering individuals of the feminine and masculine gender, is made based on the generic masculine: a collective of vinte meninas ("twenty girls") and dez meninos ("ten boys"), is said as trinta meninos (literally, "thirty boys"). This form of plural formation is considered sexist by certain groups and individuals, resulting in proposals for a neutral gender to be adopted, such as "thirty children" (trinta menines).

A similar known neopronoun in Portuguese is ile, also called sistema ile ("ile system"), was popularized in 2020. The systems happen to be same when applying neolanguage beyond pronouns, they use ⟨-e⟩ suffixes.

[[Hydrogel]]

CATEGORIES: Polymers

Hydrogels are three-dimensional polymeric networks filled with water. The water content can reach as high as 90-99% depending on the polymer concentration. It contains polymers that are attracted to water, they swell and hold large amounts of water while maintaining their structure due to chemical or physical cross-linking of individual polymer chains. The physical cross-linked hydrogels are easily pulled and relaxed, like a rubber band. The chemically cross-linked hydrogels avoid deformation. The behaviour of hydrogels is typically viscoelastic which is associated with the water and the movement of polymer networks in fluids. Similar to other polymers, there are natural and man-made hydrogels. The man-made hydrogels are also known as synthetic, this allows the hydrogels to have a longer service life, hold more water, and have greater strength. 

There are many types of hydrogels. The most common ones are pH-sensitive hydrogels, which respond to pH changes in the environment. Temperature-sensitive hydrogels, which are affected by how hot or cold the environment is. Electro-sensitive hydrogels, which either shrink or expand when an electric field is applied. Lastly, the light-responsive hydrogels respond to light. 

In many ways hydrogels are similar to our bodies because the human body is made out of mainly water and matrix materials that are surrounded by cells. This is why hydrogels can be used in tissue engineering. Hydrogels are filled with water so they mimic tissue environments, this means they are optimal to deliver cells and repair damaged tissue.
