[[History of the creation–evolution controversy]]

CATEGORIES: CS1 maint: ref=harv, Creation myths, Evolution

The creation–evolution controversy has a long history. Scientists had some ideas how evolution works.  Because some of these theories contradict the literal intepretation of the creation myth in the Book of Genesis, religious people and organizations questioned these ideas. For a long time, only the priests could read the Bible, which was written in Latin or in Greek. It was only the priests who interpreted the texts in the Bible. The priests often said that the Book of Genesis shoild not be read literally and taught it as an allegory. With the advent of the printing press, the Bible was translated into other languagres.  More people were able to read and write, and more literal understandings of scripture flourished. This allowed some religious persons and groups to challenge scientists who supported evolution, such as biologists Thomas Henry Huxley and Ernst Haeckel.

[[Cheesman's big-eyed tree frog]]

CATEGORIES: Animals of Oceania, Frogs

Cheesman's big-eyed tree frog (Nyctimystes cheesmani)  is a tree frog from southeastern Papua New Guinea.

The adult male frog is 4.8 to 5.7 cm long, and the adult female frog is 5.5 to 6.5 cm long.  It can be light brown to dark brown or green-brown in color.  It has very dark eyes.  It has purple color on some parts of its body.  It has vomerine teeth in its upper jaw.

Scientists found this frog in streams in forests that were open enough for the sunlight to come through.

In 2020, the International Commission of Zoological Nomenclature considered calling the frog "cheesmanae" but decided not to.

[[Flat-headed cat]]

CATEGORIES: Mammals of Asia, Cats

The flat-headed cat (Prionailurus planiceps) is a wildcat that lives in Indonesia and Malaysia.  It used to live in Thailand but may be extinct there.

This cat is 45 to 52 cm long (18 to 20 inches) and its tail is another 12 to 17 cm long (4.7 to 7 inches).  It weights 1.5 to 2.5 kilograms (3.3 to 5.5 pounds).  It is about the size of a domestic cat but its legs and tail are shorter, its body is longer, its paws are rounder, and its head is flatter.  Its fur is red-brown and dark brown and it has white marks on its face and a white belly.  Unlike most cats' claws, the flat-headed cat's claws do not retract all the way.

The flat-headed cat lives in low rainforests, swamps, lakes, and forests with rivers in them.  It catches its food in the water, and its body helps: Its teeth point backwards in its mouth so fish cannot get away.  Its jaws are longer and narrower than other cats' jaws.  It has some webbing between its toes.

Some scientists think this cat likes water even more than the fishing cat does.  When some scientists studying apes caught a flat-headed cat by accident, they let it go between a forest and a river.  The cat ran to the river and dove in instead of running to the trees to hide.  The scientists thought that the cat felt safer in the water than in the trees.

Like other cats, the flat-headed cat sprays urine to mark its territory, but while other cats stand up and spray onto a tall object like a tree.  The flat-headed cat crouches down and sprays while it walks, leaving its urine on the ground.

The flat-headed cat is pregnant for 56 days.  Female cats have one to four kittens at a time.  In zoos, a flat-headed cat can live 14 years.

Flat-headed cats are endangered because of pollution and because humans catch too many fish but mostly because humans have cut down the forests to build farms.  Flat-headed cats like forests that are not too far above sea level, and this makes good farmland, so humans want it.  Some scientists think that flat-headed cats can live in forests that have grown back after being cut down.  Scientists do not think the flat-headed cat can hunt and live near farms the way the Iriomote cat does.

[[Ajuran Sultanate]]

CATEGORIES: 13th-century establishments in Africa, Empires

The Ajuran Empire (Dawladdii Ajuuraan, دولة الأجورانية), also spelled Ajuuraan Empire, and often simply as Ajuran, was a Somali empire in the medieval times that dominated the Indian ocean trade. They belonged to the Somali Muslim sultanate that ruled over large parts of the Horn of Africa in the Middle Ages. Because of their centralized administration and strong military, they were able to resist an attack by the Ottoman empire. This was called  Gaal Madow. The fought a number of wars with the Portugese, and were able to withstand them. After the war, trade routes were re-established or strengthened. In the coastal provinces, trade flourished. Ships sailed to and came from many kingdoms and empires in East Asia, South Asia, Europe, the Near East, North Africa and East Africa.

The empire was very important, and built many castles and fortresses. Some of them can still be seen, mostly in the southern part of Somalia. There are also a number of pillar tombs, necropolises, and cities built during that era, which are now in ruins, which are attributed to Ajuran engineers. During the Ajuran period, many regions and people in the southern part of the Horn of Africa converted to Islam because of the theocratic nature of the government. The royal family, the House of Garen, expanded its territories and established its hegemonic rule through a skillful combination of warfare, trade linkages and alliances.

The Ajuran also controlled the water resources. They built wells and cisterns on the rivers Shebelle and Jubba. Many of these wells are still working. The rulers also developed a new system of agriculture and taxation, which were used in parts of the Horn of Africa until the 19th century. The later rulers of the Ajuran were not as successful: There were rebellions, and by the late 17th century the empire had fallen apart into a number of smaller states. The most prominent of these was probably the Geledi Sultanate.

[[Sun and moon letters]]

CATEGORIES: Arabic language, Linguistics

In Arabic and Maltese, consonants are divided into two groups: the sun/solar letters (حروف شمسية ar, Maltese: konsonanti xemxin) and moon/lunar letters (حروف قمرية ar, Maltese: konsonanti qamrin).

In those languages, all nouns start with the word "al" (الـ) in Arabic or "il" in Maltese. Both words mean "the." If a sun letter comes after the consonant, the "l" sound in "al" or "il" is dropped and is replaced by whatever sound the letter makes. However, if a moon letter comes after, the "l" sound in those words stays.

In Arabic, the word for "the sun" is ash-shams because the "sh" sound is a sun letter. Meanwhile, the word for "the moon" is al-qamar because the "q" sound is a moon letter.

The Madang big-eyed tree frog  (Nyctimystes disruptus)  is a tree frog from Papua New Guinea.  It also used to be called Richard's big-eyed tree frog.  Scientists have seen it in mountain ranges in central and eastern New Guinea, though they think it could live in other places as well.  They found it 1500 to 2000 meters above sea level.

Scientists say this frog looks a lot like the Papua big-eyed tree frog but with more webbing on its feet and clearer lines on its lower eyelids.  This frog has short, broken lines on its lower eyelids.  This frog has pupils in its eyes that go up and down and open side to side.  It can be many different colors.  Scientists have found frogs that are brown with white spots, gray with purple marks and green with brown markings on the back.  The adult male frog is about 7.4 cm long and the adult female is about 8.0 cm long.

For a while, scientists thought another group of frogs, Nyctimystes oktediensis, was a separate species, but other scientists say these frogs are also Madang big-eyed tree frogs.

In the local Kaironk language, this frog is called kwyos and gepgep.

[[Flora (mythology)]]

CATEGORIES: Roman gods and goddesses

Flora is the goddess of flowers and spring in Roman mythology.

The name Flōra descends from Proto-Italic *flōsā ('goddess of flowers'), itself a derivation from Proto-Italic *flōs ('flower'; cf. Latin flōs, flōris 'blossom, flower'). It is cognate with the Oscan goddess of flowers Fluusa, demonstrating that the cult was known more widely among Italic peoples. The name ultimately derives from Proto-Indo-European *bʰleh₃ōs ('blossoming').

Her festival, the Floralia, was held between April 28 and May 3 and symbolized the renewal of the cycle of life, drinking, and flowers. The festival was first instituted in 240 B.C.E, and on the advice of the Sibylline books, she was also given a temple in 238 B.C.E. At the festival, with the men decked in flowers, and the women wearing normally forbidden gay costumes, five days of farces and mimes were enacted – ithyphallic, and including nudity when called for – followed by a sixth day of the hunting of goats and hares. On May 23 another (rose) festival was held in her honor.

Flora's Greek equivalent is Chloris, who was a nymph. Flora is married to Favonius, the wind god also known as Zephyr, and her companion was Hercules.

Flora achieved more prominence in the neo-pagan revival of Antiquity among Renaissance humanists than she had ever enjoyed in ancient Rome.

Alexiares and Anicetus (Ἀλεξιάρης Alexiarês and Ανικητος Anikêtos) are minor deities in Greek Mythology. They are the immortal twin sons of Heracles, the greatest of the Greek heroes and the strongest mortal to live. Their mother was Hebe, the goddess of youth the server of Ambrosia and nectar to the other Olympian gods. Along with their father Heracles, they were the guardians of Mount Olympus, and the pair may have been regarded as the gatekeepers of Olympus, a role which was often assigned to their immortal father. Additionally, they were responsible for the protection and fortification of towns and citadels, they were also the gods of defense and sports. They were born after Hercules's mortal death and ascent to Olympus, where he gained immortality and married the goddess Hebe. Callimachus makes a reference to Hebe receiving assistance from her sister during the birth of her sons, Eiliethyia the goddess of midwives and childbirth. Their names mean "he who wards off war" and "the unconquerable one" respectively.

The twins were worshipped the most in Thebes and Rhodes, their powers were said to be youth and sports. Little is known about them besides a mention of their birth in the Bibliotheca: "Heracles achieved immortality, and when Hera’s enmity changed to friendship, he married her daughter Hebe, who bore him twin sons Alexiares and Anicetus."

Six singles were released from the album. The most successful was Rope, which went straight to number one on Billboard's Rock Songs chart.

[[Incubation]]

CATEGORIES: Birds, Reptiles, Animal husbandry

Incubation or brooding, is when oviparous (egg-laying) animals sit on their  eggs to hatch them. It also refers to the development of the embryo in the egg under good environmental conditions. 

Since birds are warm-blooded, they sit on the eggs to keep them warm. Reptiles and invertebrates are cold-blooded, and so need to keep their eggs in warm places. Sometimes even birds need the help of the Sun.

Many factors may be vital to the incubation. In some reptiles for example, no fixed temperature is necessary. However, the actual temperature determines the sex ratio of the offspring. In birds, by contrast, the sex of offspring is genetically determined, but a constant and particular temperature may be necessary for successful incubation.

In poultry, the act of sitting on eggs to incubate them is called 'brooding'. The action or tendency to sit on a clutch of eggs is also called broodiness.

CATEGORIES: Socialism, Marxism

A class traitor is someone who is thought to be working against the interests of the particular social class.

However, some people think that anyone, including the bourgeois, can become class traitors.

The motives behind becoming a traitor to one's class can include: survival (taking up whatever wage is available), the belief that the person is of a higher class and so has political views that work against the working class, the pressure to follow rules and laws, or disagreeing with the view that society is divided up into classes that are fighting each other.

[[Majorana fermion]]

CATEGORIES: Physics

A Majorana fermion(m), also referred to as a Majorana particle, is a fermion that has the same properties as its antiparticle. Ettore Majorana, an Italian physicist, thought they would exist, in 1937.  Majorana disappeared in 1938, and the particles are named after him. As Majorana fermionns are thought to have the same properties as their antiparticles, they cannot have an electric charge. Today, atomic particles with an electric charge are called Dirac fermions. An example for Dirac fermions are electrons, and positrons; they have the same properties, but their electric charge is different. 

Neutrinos do not have an electric charge, and might be Majorana fermions, but their status is unclear

[[Numen]]

CATEGORIES: History of religion

Numen, pl. numina,  is a Latin term.  It is used  for "divinity", a "divine presence" or a "divine will." The Latin authors defined it as follows. Cicero writes of a "divine mind" (divina mens), a god "whose numen everything obeys," and a "divine power" (vis divina) "which pervades the lives of men." It causes the motions and cries of birds during augury. In his Aeneid, Virgil tells about the  how the one-eyed giant, Polyphemus, is blinded:  First, Odysseus and his men "ask for the assistance of the great numina" (magna precati numina). Reviewing public opinion of Augustus on the day of his funeral, the historian Tacitus reports that some thought "no honor was left to the gods" when he "established the cult of himself" (se ... coli vellet) "with temples and the effigies of numina" (effigie numinum). Pliny the younger in a letter to Paternus raves about the "power," the "dignity," and "the majesty;" in short, the "numen of history." Lucretius uses the expression numen mentis, or "bidding of the mind," where "bidding" is numen, not, however, the divine numen, unless the mind is to be considered divine, but as simply human will.

Since the early 20th century, numen has sometimes been treated in the history of religion as a pre-animistic phase. This is a belief system that comes from an earlier time. Sociologists also use the term Numen to refer to the idea of magical power coming from an object, particularly when writing about ideas in the western tradition. When used in this sense, numen means almost the same thing as mana. However, some authors only use the word mana for ideas about magic from Polynesia and Southeast Asia.

They were promised that they would have tino rangatiratanga forever in the treaty. However, this concept was not respected since the British colonizers took a lot of things from the Māori people.

[[Executive order]]

CATEGORIES: Law

An executive order or executive decree is a rule or order, or a law made by a head of state (president or monarch) who has this power given to him by the constitution of the country. The order tells ministries, agencies, the civil service and the military of a state the things that they must do.

Executive orders can be stopped by the courts in a process called judicial review. They may be stopped by the courts or the legislature if they are against laws or against the constitution. 

However, in countries where there is no real separation of powers and the head of state is actually a dictator, the executive order cannot be stopped by the courts or the legislature, which as a result have no powers and are controlled by him. In many cases, the head of state with dictatorial powers often rules the country by making executive orders rather than making laws in the legislature which he also controls.

Executive orders have a big effect on the internal affairs of the government and on the citizens. They decide how and to what degree legislation will be enforced. They also deal with emergencies and wars.

On 4 August 2020, an explosion happened in the city of Beirut, the capital of Lebanon.

The blast happened at the Port of Beirut and left at least 215 people dead (with the total expected to go higher), at least 7,500 injured, and many more missing. The Governor of Beirut, Marwan Abboud, said over 300,000 people lost their homes.

It is said that the explosion may have been caused by 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate. Ammonium nitrate is a chemical substance that can be used for fertilizer. It can also be used to make explosives. The government took the ammonium nitrate from a ship in the port of Damascus, the MV Rhosus. The MV Rhosus had been abandoned in the port, after the Lebanese government said it was no longer fit to travel by sea. The ammonium nitrate was then stored in the port, for at least six years. This may have been without the proper precautions. There are various regulations how ammonium nitrate should be stored, and handled.  In its pure form, ammonium nitrate does not burn; but it increases fires a great deal. It should therefore not be stored near flammable substances, and it should not be heated in a closed space. It is also very sensitive to temperature.

Before the big explosion, here seems to have been a fire in a part of the warehouse, where fireworks were stored. The ammonium nitrate was stored in the same building.

The explosion has been compared to three thousand tonnes of TNT.

Some countries offered medical aid, rescue teams and money to help deal with the aftermath of the disaster.

[[Overeating]]

CATEGORIES: Nutrition, Health problems, Lifestyles

Overeating (or over-eating) is eating food more than the body needs. There is a relationship between the energy that an organism uses and the amount eaten. Eating more leads to weight gaining and often obesity. It may be regarded as an eating disorder.

One consequence of overeating is weight gain, and excess weight may cause blood pressure to rise. In turn this makes illness and even death more likely.

The problem is very difficult to reverse: losing weight is often attempted, but rarely succeeds. Weight lost is usually rapidly replaced. Diets are famously unsuccessful. Obesity is the end product of overeating.

Some difficult facts are known. Poorer families tend to eat worse food than better-off families. Children learn from the experiences in their families. Once established, habits are hard to break. In 2013, several medical societies, including the American Medical Association and the American Heart Association, classified obesity as a disease.

[[Cassegrain telescope]]

CATEGORIES: Telescopes

Cassegrain telescopes are reflector telescopes that use two curved mirrors to make an image. The big primary mirror gathers and concentrates light. The small secondary mirror then reflects the light through the back of the mirror. The secondary mirror is also curved so that it the light path is longer than the tube.

A "true Cassegrain" uses a primary mirror with a parabola-shaped curve, and a secondary mirror with a hyperbola-shaped curve. This is hard to make. Sphere-shaped curves are easier to make, but the image would be blurry. Catadioptric (lens and mirror) telescopes fix this by putting a special lens in front of the telescope.

Cassegrains are useful both as amateur telescopes which normal people can buy, and for scientists for serious astronomy work.

[[Gregorian telescope]]

CATEGORIES: Telescopes

A Gregorian telescope was the first telescope to be designed that uses mirrors instead of lenses. It was invented by the English astronomer John Gregory. Even though it was designed in 1663, it wasn't the first reflecting telescope to be built. Newton's telescope, a different design, was built in 1668. The Gregorian telescope was first built in 1673 by Robert Hooke.

The telescope uses two curved mirrors. The large primary gathers light, and the small secondary reflects the light out the back of the primary mirror. Both mirrors are concave (bowl-shaped).

It is very similar to the Cassegrain telescope, which uses a large concave primary mirror and a small convex secondary mirror.

[[Herschelian telescope]]

CATEGORIES: Telescopes

A Herschelian telescope was invented in the 1780s by William Herschel. It is similar to a Newtonian telescope, except using only one mirror. 

In the 1780s, telescopes used metal mirrors which were not very reflective. Each mirror would absorb light and make the image dimmer. So Herschel invented a telescope with a tilted mirror that put the eyepiece in the front.

When mirrors became more reflective, Herschelian telescopes stopped being useful.

[[Lenticel]]

CATEGORIES: Trees, Plant physiology

A lenticel is  porous tissue in the bark of trees. Its cells make large intercellular spaces in the periderm of the bark. They are found in the woody stems and roots of dicotyledonous flowering plants. 

Lenticels are also found in other woody plants, starting in the Carboniferous period. The development and increase in these primitive lenticels gave a system  for aeration and gas exchange in these plants.

Lenticels work as pores for the direct exchange of gases. Otherwise the bark is impermeable to gases. The name 'lenticel' comes from its lenticular (lens-like) shape. The shape of lenticels is one of the characteristics used for tree identification.

The Pontcysyllte Aqueduct (Traphont Ddŵr Pontcysyllte) is a canal aqueduct in north east Wales. It took 10 years to design and build. It was completed in 1805. It is the longest aqueduct in Great Britain, and is the highest canal aqueduct in the world. The 18-arched stone and cast iron structure is designed for narrowboats.

The aqueduct was part of a grand plan which was never completed. It was part of the proposed Ellesmere Canal. It would have been an industrial waterway which made a  link between the River Severn at Shrewsbury and the port of Liverpool on the River Mersey. 

The westerly high-ground route across the Vale of Llangollen was chosen. A less expensive route was surveyed to the east, but the route chosen would have taken the canal through a mineral-rich area. It would have taken the canal through the coalfields of North-East Wales. However, only parts of the canal route were completed. The plan fell through because the money ran out. The capitalist system at the time was primitive and unreliable. Most major work on the canal stopped after the completion of the Pontcysyllte Aqueduct in 1805.

The structure is a Grade I listed building. It is recognised as a  UNESCO World Heritage Site.

CATEGORIES: Establishments in the United Kingdom, Observatories, World Heritage Sites in the United Kingdom, Radio receivers

The Jodrell Bank Observatory a radio telescope in Cheshire. It picks up radio waves from outer space. Jodrell Bank is mainly used for investigating radio waves from the planets and stars.

It was the idea of its first director, Bernard Lovell, to use radio signals to investigate cosmic rays. Lovell, Professor of Astronomy at Manchester University, had worked on radar in World War II. The observatory was set up in 1945.  

It has been used to research meteoroids, quasars, pulsars, masers and gravitational lenses. It was heavily involved in tracking space probes.

The main telescope at the observatory is the Lovell Telescope. It has diameter of 250, and is the third largest steerable radio telescope in the world. There are three other active telescopes at the observatory. 

The Jodrell Bank Observatory is the base of the Multi-Element Radio Linked Interferometer Network (MERLIN), a "National Facility" run by the University of Manchester. What this means is that radio telescopes can work together to form a long baseline to better collect data from an important phenomenon. There are three other active telescopes at the observatory; the Mark II, and 42 and 7 m diameter radio telescopes. 

The telescope discovered radio noise from the Great Nebula in Andromeda—the first definite detection of an extragalactic radio source—and the remains of Tycho's Supernova in the radio frequency. At that time, Tycho's Supervova had not been discovered by regular light telescopes.

[[Spanish naming customs]]

CATEGORIES: Spanish culture, Names

Spanish naming customs are traditions for naming children as used in Spain. 

A person's name consists of a given name (simple or composite) followed by two surnames. Historically, the first surname was the father's first surname, and the second the mother's first surname. 

In recent years, the order of the surnames in a family is done when registering the first child. However, the traditional order is still largely the choice. Often, the practice is to use one given name and the first surname most of the time (e.g. "Miguel de Unamuno" for Miguel de Unamuno y Jugo). The complete name being usually reserved for legal, formal, and documentary matters. 

Both surnames are sometimes used when the first surname is very common (e.g., Federico García Lorca, Pablo Ruiz Picasso or José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero) to get a more customized name. In these cases, it is even common to use only the second surname, as in "Lorca", "Picasso" or "Zapatero". This does not affect alphabetization: "Lorca", the Spanish poet, must be alphabetized in an index under "García Lorca" and not "Lorca".

Hahoe Folk Village is a village in South Korea.  It has buildings and other things that were built in the Joseon Dynasty or that have been rebuilt in the same style.  Hahoe Village hosts cultural events, including traditional mask dances.  It is in the city of Andong, in North Gyeongsang Province.  It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

The people who built the town used Confucian philosophy and the clan system to decide where to put each building and road.  The clan system was very important in Korea during the Joseon Dynasty.  Some of the houses are made of wood and some are made of mud.  Some of the houses have tile roofs and some have thatched roofs.  Some of the buildings are made of traditional materials and some have been rebuilt with modern materials.  There is a 600 year old zelkova tree in the village.  People have named the tree "Samsindang," and there is a shrine next to it.  Unlike many homes in South Korea, which face south, the houses in Hahoe Village face the tree.  The Byeongsanseowon Confucian Academy is 4 km east of the village.

People still live in Hahoe Folk Village.  Many of them are members of the Ryu clan who have lived there since the 1400s. There are about 127 households in Hahoe Folk Village.  Some of them still have a jongga or head of the family and practice ancestor worship in the Confucian way.

Hahoe Folk Village is known for its traditional outdoor mask performances.  Most traditional masks in Korea are made out of calabash and are used only once.  Masks in Hahoe are made from wood, usually alder wood, and are reused many times.

Hahoe Folk Village also hosts Seonyu Julbul Nori.  On the birthday of the spiritual leader Buddha, people ride down the Nakdong River in boats.  People read poetry.  There is also a display called line fire. This is a special way of lighting fireworks.  Mulberry tree charcoal is put in long pouches that are tied every few centimeters on their length.  The pouches are attached to a rope made of straw, one pouch every five meters.  The rope is long enough to go between two trees.  One end of one charcoal pouch is lit, and it takes a long time for all the charcoal to burn down the whole length of the rope.

The name "Hahoe" comes from "ha" for "river" and "hoe" for "turn around" in Korean.  The village is built right where the Nakdong River turns around.  

In 2020, the village added a traditional brushwood bridge near Hahoe Folk Village.

Queen Elizabeth II visited Hahoe Folk village in 2019.

[[Creswell Crags]]

CATEGORIES: Archaeological sites in England, Caves, Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire

Creswell Crags is a limestone gorge on the border between Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire, England. It is near the villages of Creswell and Whitwell. 

The cliffs in the ravine have several caves. The caves were occupied during the last ice age, between around 43,000 and 10,000 years ago. They have the northernmost cave art in Europe. The evidence of occupation is found in the rich series of sediments that accumulated over many thousands of years. It is internationally unique in showing  how prehistoric people lived at the extreme  northernmost limits of their territory in the later Pleistocene Ice Age.

The caves have layers with flint tools from the Mousterian, and later cultures. They were seasonally occupied by nomadic groups of people during the Upper Palaeolithic and Mesolithic periods. Evidence of Neolithic, Bronze Age, Roman and post-medieval activity has also been found there. There is evidence of Neanderthal occupation 50,000–60,000 years ago, a brief Gravettian occupation around 32,000 years ago and use of all the main caves during the Magdalenian around 14,000 years ago. The site is open to the public and has a visitor centre with a small museum of objects.

Creswell Crags has been designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). It has also been put forward as a potential World Heritage Site.

In 2006–07, the B6042 road was re-routed from its path through the gorge, by approximately 150 to the north, to minimise traffic impact on the site.

[[Roman Theatre of Orange]]

CATEGORIES: Theatres in France, Ancient Rome, World Heritage Sites in France

The Roman Theatre of Orange (French: Théâtre antique d'Orange) is a Roman theatre in Orange, Vaucluse, France. It was built early in the 1st century AD. The municipality of Orange owns the structure. The theatre is the home of the summer opera festival called the Chorégies d'Orange.

It is a very well preserved Roman theatres. It served the Roman colony of Arausio (more specifically, Colonia Julia Firma Secundanorum Arausio: "the Julian colony of Arausio started by the soldiers of the second legion"). This colony was founded in 40 BC. The theatre played an important role in the life of the citizens. They spent a large part of their free time there.The Roman authorities saw it as a way to spread spreading Roman culture to the colonies. They also saw it as a way to make them forget about political activities.

Mime, pantomime, poetry readings and the "attelana" (a kind of farce, similar to the commedia dell'arte) were the most important forms of entertainment. It often lasted all day. The common people liked spectacular effects and beautiful stage sets became very important. The use of stage machinery also became important. The entertainment was open to everyone. It was free of charge.

The Western Roman Empire declined during the 4th century. Christianity had become the official religion. An official edict closed the theatre in AD 391. This is because at that time the Church was against what it saw as uncivilised performances. The Visigoths probably pillaged it in 412. Like most Roman buildings, a lot of its better stone was used again for other buildings. It was used as a defensive post in the early Middle Ages. By the 12th century, the Church started to use it for religious plays. During the 16th-century there were religious wars. The theatre became a place to hide for the townspeople. In 1981 UNESCO declared the theatre as a World Heritage Site. In modern days, it is used mostly for opera. It is also a tourist attraction.

[[Yangdong Folk Village]]

CATEGORIES: Villages in Asia, Buildings and structures in South Korea, World Heritage Sites in South Korea

Yangdong Folk Village is a village in South Korea's North Gyeongsang Province.  It is inside the city of Gyeongju, which used to be the capital of Korea.  It has buildings and other things that were built in the Joseon Dynasty or that have been rebuilt in the same style.  It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Yangdong was built in the 1400s by two important clans, Yeogang Lee and Wolseong Son.  Many of the people who live in Yangdong now are from these families.  Many members of these families who do not live in Yangdong come back a few times a year for special occasions.

Yangdong Folk Village is a World Heritage Site as part of a pair with Hahoe Folk Village.  Both places were built during the Joseon Dynasty and many of the buildings are still intact.  Some of the buildings have been rebuilt with modern materials, though.  Like Hahoe, Yangdong's layout shows influences from the Confucian way of thinking and the importance of the clan system in Korea at the time.  There are timber houses with tiled roofs for high-ranking people and mud houses with thatched roofs that were originally for low-ranking people. The village is on the sides of hills.  The buildings were built in specific places so their rooftops would match and complement the hillsides around them.  The buildings belonging to nobler or richer people are higher up on the hills.  One home once had 99 rooms.

There are two Confucian schools, Oksanseowon and Donggangseowon, near Yangdong Folk Village.

There are about 149 houses in Yangdong Folk Village and people still live in them.  Yangdong Folk Village has modern, paved roads, some modern bridges, and a railway.

Before it was declared a World Heritage Site around 2010, few people visited Yangdong.  After it was declared a World Heritage Site, many more came.  People worried about whether the extra visitors would damage the site. Tourists, including schoolchildren on field trips, often visit Yangdong.

Famous people from Yangdong include the Joseon era philosopher Lee Eon-jeok (1491-1553), nicknamed "Hoejae." Hojae is called one of the "Five Great Sages of the East."

[[Complex of Koguryo tombs]]

CATEGORIES: Archaeological sites in Asia, World Heritage Sites in Asia, World Heritage Sites in North Korea, Buildings and structures in Korea

The complex of Koguryo tombs or Goguryeo tombs is a group of tombs, or places where human bodies are buried, in North Korea. The tombs were built during the Kingdom of Koguryo, which ruled parts of China and Korea from 37 b.c.e. to the 7th century c.e.  These tombs were declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2004.

The tombs are made of stonework and earthwork and some of them have large, detailed paintings inside them.  Historians have found about 10,000 tombs from the Koguryo kingdom in China and Korea.  Only about 100 of them have paintings on the inside.  80 of these painted tombs are in what we today call the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, or North Korea.  63 tombs are part of the World Heritage Site, and 16 of these tombs have paintings.  They were chosen because their paintings are so detailed and show daily life, because the way they were built shows good engineering, because modern people can use the tombs to tell what the people of the Kingdom of Koguryo thought about burying people, and because the burials in the Kingdom of Koguryo affected many later countries, including the modern Koreas and Japan.

The 63 tombs of the World Heritage Site are not all in the same place.  They are spread out across the city of Pyongyang and nearby provinces.  Historians think these tombs were made for kings and other royals and nobles.

Sometimes experts from North Korea and South Korea work together on the Koguryo tombs, but this depends on how well the two countries are getting along.

Thieves and other looters broke into some of the tombs, and only a few were completely untouched when scientists first saw them.

In 2018, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea began to allow more visitors from outside the country to see the tombs.  This was part of a plan to improve the economy.

In May 2020, the National Museum of Korea in Seoul, South Korea, produced a digital exhibit called Immersive Digital Galleries.  This exhibit included digital versions of some of the paintings from the Anak No. 3 tomb.

[[Crevasse]]

CATEGORIES: Geology

A crevasse is a deep crack, or fracture, found in an ice sheet or glacier. It is like a crevice that forms in rock. Crevasses form as a result of the movement caused by the shear stress between two semi-rigid pieces of ice.

Crevasses often have vertical or near-vertical walls, which can then melt and create seracs, arches, and other ice formations.

[[Baltimore Plot]]

CATEGORIES: 1861, Abraham Lincoln, Baltimore, Maryland

The Baltimore Plot was a plan by pro-slavery owners in late February 1861 to assassinate President-elect of the United States Abraham Lincoln. The plan was to kill Lincoln while he was on his way to his inauguration. 

Allan Pinkerton, founder of the Pinkerton National Detective Agency, played a key role by being in charge of Lincoln's security throughout the journey. Though scholars debate whether or not the threat was real, clearly Lincoln and his advisors believed that there was a threat and took actions to make sure he traveled safely through Baltimore, Maryland. This was where Lincoln's plotted assassination would have happened.

Lincoln arrived secretly in Washington, D.C. on February 23, 1861.   A planned train route through Bellaire, Ohio, to Wheeling, Virginia (West Virginia had yet to break off from Virginia) and eastward, was redirected up through the Pittsburgh through Pennsylvania, into  Maryland and eventually to Washington.

For the remainder of his presidency, Lincoln's many critics would call him a coward because he was in disguise while travelling secretly to Washington.

[[Ray tracing]]

CATEGORIES: Computer graphics

Ray tracing is a computer algorithm for drawing very realistic 3D images.

With ray tracing, objects in the scene are described with geometrical shapes like spheres or planes. The computer then sends rays (straight lines) forward from where the camera is. The objects that get hit by these rays are the objects that the camera can see. The computer then draws these objects. This is similar to how our eyes see but in the real world the rays (light) go the opposite way – from the world to our eyes. If we made rays go from the world to the camera, most of the rays would not hit the camera, and we would have to wait a long time until we see an image appear. That is why instead, we make rays go from the camera to the world, meaning we know all the rays we create will go to the camera.

[[Crinkle crankle wall]]

CATEGORIES: Walls

A crinkle crankle wall is a brick wall built in alternate convex and concave curves. It is sometimes described as a serpentine wall or a wavy wall. It is found most often in England, though the idea has been used elsewhere. The walls do look elegant, but the main object is practical. The format resists the usual pushes from the surrounding earth, and so needs fewer repairs than straight walls do.

Thomas Jefferson (1743–1826) incorporated serpentine walls into the architecture of the University of Virginia, which he founded. On both sides of its rotunda and down the length of the lawn are ten pavilions. Each has its own walled garden separated by crinkle crankle walls.

Many crinkle crankle walls are found in East Anglia, England. There the marshes of The Fens were drained by Dutch engineers, starting in the mid-1600s. They apparently introduced the idea.  The county of Suffolk has at least 50 examples, twice as many as in the rest of the country. The term "crinkle crankle" is said to derive from a Suffolk dialect. The crinkle crankle wall running from the former manor house to All Saints' Church in the estate village of Easton is believed to be the longest existing example.

The idea, which is never seen in cities, is not that uncommon in south-eastern England. The ancient village of Wheathampstead in Hertfordshire has a crinckle-crankle wall near its church. It has needed far less maintenance than the straight walls in the vicinity.

In Lymington, Hampshire, there are at least two examples of crinkle crankle walls. The older of the two is thought to have been constructed at the time of the Napoleonic Wars (1803–1815) by exiled Hanoverian soldiers living in a nearby house.

[[Chiappa Rhino]]

CATEGORIES: Revolvers

The Chiappa Rhino is a revolver. It fires bullets from the bottom of the cylinder. This is different from most other revolvers, which fire from the top of the cylinder.

The Rhino is named after the rhinoceros because it looks somewhat like a rhinoceros's head. Most models shoot the .357 Magnum (as well as the .38 Special), but there are also models that shoot the 9x19mm Parabellum or the S&W .40. Due to its futuristic look, it is often shown in science-fiction movies like the live-action Ghost in the Shell, Terminator: Dark Fate, and the remake of Total Recall.

[[Jongmyo]]

CATEGORIES: Buildings and structures in Seoul, World Heritage Sites in South Korea

Jongmyo Shrine is a religious building in Seoul, South Korea.  It is a Confucian royal shrine from the Joseon Dynasty.  It was built in the late 1300s, destroyed during a Japanese invasion in the 1500s, and rebuilt in the 1600s.  People still use it in modern times.

The Jongmyo Shrine holds spirit tablets, each dedicated to a specific king or queen from the Joseon Dynasty.  The Confucian way of life includes ancestor worship.  During the Joseon Dynasty, the king of Korea would go to Jongmyo to pray to earlier kings and queens.  There were also larger rites, with more people.  Some of them involved singing and dancing.  Some of these rites are still performed in modern times.

The layout of the shrine was planned very carefully to complement and work with the hills and other natural structures around it.  

Jongmyo has a main shrine, called Jeongjeon.  It has a smaller shrine called Yeongnyeongjeon, or "the Hall of Eternal Peace" in English.  It also has a place specifically for the king, a storage building for ritual items, and a waiting area.  There is also a specific shrine to King Kongmin from the earlier Koryo Dynasty.  That shrine was built by the Joseon-era King Taejo.

The Jongmyo-Daejae, or "Royal Shrine Ritual" in English, was the most important rite performed at the shrine.  During the Joseon Dynasty, it was performed five times each year.  During the Japanese occupation of Korea (1910-1945), it was not performed because the Japanese did not allow it.  Since 1969, the Royal Family Association has performed the Jongmyo-Daejae once each year.  The Jongmyo-Daejae itself and the music used in the Jongmyo-Daejae were both declared Intangible Cultural Heritage by UNESCO in 2001.

Jongmyo was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1995.

[[Jeju Volcanic Island and Lava Tubes]]

CATEGORIES: Volcanoes, World Heritage Sites in South Korea

Jeju Volcanic Island and lava tubes are located off the coast of South Korea.  They are in Jeju Province.  Jeju has Mount Halla, a shield volcano located over a volcanic hotspot with many parasitic volcanoes, called oreums, around it.  According to UNESCO, the Geomunoreum lava caves are "the finest lava tube system of caves anywhere." UNESCO named Jeju Volcanic Island a Biosphere Reserve in 2002, a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2007, and a Global Geopark in 2010. It is the only island in the world with three UNESCO designations.

Jeju Volcanic Island started to form 1.8 million years ago when the volcano was still active.

According to UNESCO, the three important things that make Jeju Volcanic Island and lava caves a World Heritage site are the Geomonoreum lava cages, Seongsang Ilchulbong, and Hallasan.

The Geomunoreum lava caves are covered in many-colored carbonate deposits on the roof and floor.  They formed about 300,000 years ago when magma from the Geomonoreum parasitic volcano cooled.

The Seongsan Ilchulbong tuff cone rises straight out of the ocean.  It formed between 50,000 and 120,000 years ago from underwater volcanic activity.  It is 180 meters tall.  Because it is surrounded by cliffs and sharp rocks, many people think it looks like a fortress.

Hallasan, or Mount Halla, also called Yeongjusan Mountain, is Korea's tallest mountain, 1950 meters.  It has not been an active volcano for 1000 years.  It has many rock formations, a crater lake full of islands, and many cliffs and waterfalls. Over 1800 types of plants live on the mountain and 4000 types of animals, including 3300 species of insects.

Other parts of Jeju Volcanic Island are considered important by the government of South Korea but not UNESCO.  For example, Bijarim Forest, which is on Mount Halla, is Natural Monument No. 374.

Jeju Volcanic Island is a popular tourist destination in South Korea, with 14.4 million visitors in 2019 alone.  Environmentalists say they make 20,000 tons of garbage each year.  Environmentalists and scientists have said that the government has cut down too much of Jeju's forests to make roads, buildings, resorts and golf courses for visitors.  In 2020, environmentalists protested plans to build a second airport on the island.  Among other problems, this airport would need a road through Bijarim Forest.  This is a forest of nutmeg trees, some of them 800 years old.  It is the only place in the world where nutmeg trees grow so closely together.

In 2008, Jeju Volcanic Island and Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park became sister parks.

The sixth named storm and fifth hurricane of the 2014 Atlantic hurricane season, Fay formed several hundred miles northeast of the Lesser Antilles on October 10. Initially a large subtropical cyclone, the storm gradually turned into a tropical cyclone on October 11 as it turned north. Despite being disrupted by wind shear for most of its duration, Fay steadily intensified. Turning east, Fay briefly achieved Category 1 hurricane status on October. Fay made landfall on Bermuda early on October 12 as a hurricane. Wind shear finally caused Fay to weaken to a tropical storm later that day. Fay weakened into an open trough early on October 13.

A few tropical cyclone warnings and watches were issued due to Fay on Bermuda. Despite its low strength, Fay caused much damage on Bermuda. Wind gusts over 100 mph (155 km/h) blocked roads with downed trees and poles. The winds also left a majority of the island's electric customers without power. The terminal building at L.F. Wade International Airport was flooded due to damage to its roof. Along the coast, the storm destroyed numerous boats and unmoored many others. Immediately after the hurricane, 200 Bermuda Regiment soldiers were called for cleanup and to help in damage repairs.

[[Ranoidea (genus)]]

Ranoidea is a genus of frogs in the subfamily Pelodryadinae. They live in Australia, New Guinea, the Maluku Islands, and the Louisiade Archipelago. Scientists still disagree with each other about whether Ranoidea should be its own genus or not and which frogs should be in it.  Many of the frogs in Ranoidea used to be in Litoria, Dryopsophus, or Hyla.  In 2016, one team of scientists wrote a paper saying Litoria should be divided up into other genuses. Many other amphibian scientists read it and agreed, but some did not. One reason for this was that not all of the frogs in Litoria had been studied on the DNA level.

[[Ranoidea (superfamily)]]

CATEGORIES: Ranoidea, Frogs, Taxonomy

The Ranoidea are a superfamily of frogs in the order Anura. These frogs have a fused pectoral girdle bone in their chests, no ribs, and the males hold on to the female with an axillary grip during mating. The tadpoles have a single spiracle on the left side and complex mouthparts. Some species do not have tadpoles, and small frogs grow straight from eggs. Scientists disagree about exactly which frogs should be placed in which family and on exactly where Ranoidea belongs among groups of amphibians.  Amphibian scientists often change their minds about exactly which frogs are related to each other and how closely, usually when someone finds new information (Glaw,Vences, 2001).

This superfamily contains seventeen different families, each containing at least 2 species (some contain over 300 different species).

[[MacGuffin]]

CATEGORIES: Fiction, Movie terminology, Narratology

In fiction, a MacGuffin is an object, detail, or event in the story that is important to the plot or the motivation of the story's characters. The term was first used by filmmaker Alfred Hitchcock. He was not the first to use or discover the trope, but he is given credit for coming up with the name. Other filmmakers like George Lucas used the term MacGuffin as well, but their definition was somewhat different from Hitchcock's. Nevertheless, details about MacGuffins below will describe Hitchcock's point of view.

According to Hitchcock, the MacGuffin has no importance other than moving the story forward, and it has no meaning by itself. It does not matter what the "thing" the characters want is, as long as it drives the character or moves the plot forward. In other words, any detail of a story is a MacGuffin if it can be replaced by something else without changing the rest of the story. If changing what the "thing" the characters want changes anything else in the story, then it is not a MacGuffin.

An example of a MacGuffin is Marsellus Wallace's briefcase in the movie Pulp Fiction. Getting the suitcase and giving it back to Marsellus Wallace is the reason why Wallace's hit men are willing to kill other people and risk their lives to keep it, but what is inside the briefcase is never shown or explained. According to the movie's writer and director Quentin Tarantino, he says that whatever is in the briefcase is whatever the audience wants it to be, because such knowledge of what is inside does not affect the story at all.

An example of a detail that is not a MacGuffin is the Ark of the Covenant in the movie Raiders of the Lost Ark. Even though the Ark is important to the motivation of the movie's hero, Indiana Jones, and the villains, the Nazis, the Ark's importance becomes more clear in the later half of the movie, and it cannot be replaced by anything else because the Nazis' misuse of the Ark was the direct cause of their death at the climax of the movie.

Ahlgrens was a Swedish confectionery company. It was started by Fredrik Ahlgren in the town of Gävle in 1885 as a store that sold paint and wallpaper. The business later started to also make and sell various types of chemicals, perfumes and other products. In 1908, the business introduced a brand of  mouthwash called Läkerol. The next year, pastille started to be sold under the same brand, and is still sold in multiple countries in several variants. 

In 1993, the Finnish company Huhtamäki bought Ahlgrens, then quickly rebranded all products by Ahlgrens to Leaf, except for Ahlgrens bilar.

Ahlgrens bilar (Swedish for "Ahlgren's Cars") is the best known product by Ahlgrens. They are small marshmallows in the shape of cars, which have been sold since 1953. They are marketed as 'Sveriges mest köpta bil' (Swedish for "Sweden's most bought car"), which might technically be correct because of the total number of marshmallows in the shape of cars that are sold. Ahlgrens bilar are so popular in Sweden that some stores that are designed to cater for tourists and residents from Sweden in other countries have started to also sell them.

Other car-related and road-related products are sold as Ahlgrens bilar, including liquorice car tyres, travel trailers and sour road signs. Out of the sour road signs, tourists from Germany specifically enjoy the elk warning signs.

[[Petunia Pig]]

CATEGORIES: Looney Tunes characters, Fictional pigs, Fictional characters introduced in 1937

Petunia Pig is an animated fictional character under the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series of cartoons from Warner Bros. She looks quite a bit like her significant other, the Porky Pig. But she wears braids and a dress.

Petunia was introduced by the animator Frank Tashlin in the 1937 short Porky's Romance. The movie is a parody of a 1932 Walt Disney cartoon called Mickey's Nightmare, except Mickey Mouse marries his long-time girlfriend Minnie Mouse in that movie. Porky's overtures toward Petunia bring him only the scornful laughs of his lover pig. 

Tashlin adopted Petunia as a regular member of Porky's crew. He (Tashlin) showed her in two more cartoons: The Case of the Stuttering Pig and Porky's Double Trouble.

As Porky's being popular was overshadowed in the late 1930s and 1940s by other characters, such as Daffy Duck and Bugs Bunny, he himself was reduced to a supporting player under new Merrie Melodies and Looney Tunes shorts. Petunia, only a bit player to Porky's lead, fared worse.

But later, Petunia made appearances in other specials, like Bugs Bunny's Christmas Carol.

The regular adult Petunia was a guest star under DC Comics' Looney Tunes' comic book and in the official Looney Tunes website.

Petunia also appears in Looney Tunes Cartoons. Her first showing in the series was presented in the piece Happy Birthday, Bugs Bunny.

[[Women who have sex with women]]

CATEGORIES: Human sexuality

Women who have sex with women (WSW) are women who engage in sexual activities with other women. They may be lesbian, heterosexual or bisexual. They may not at all have any sexual identity. The term WSW is used often in medical literature to describe such women in a clinical study.

Lesbians are less likely than heterosexual or bisexual women to get screened for cervical cancer. Some are refused medical screenings by medical professionals. 

The lower rate of lesbians tested by regular pap smears makes it more difficult to detect cervical cancer at early stages in these women. The risk factors for developing ovarian cancer rates are higher in lesbian women.

Many doctors find woman-to-woman sex to have negligible risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). The doctors fail to offer any information on prevention of STI transmission for sex between two females. Lesbians have a lower rate of getting STIs than heterosexual or bisexual women, although the risk still exists.

Dental dams, sex toys and cling wraps are often used as protection when one woman has sex with another woman.

Hurricane Laura was a deadly and destructive tropical cyclone that is tied with the 1856 Last Island hurricane for the strongest hurricane to make landfall in Louisiana in terms of maximum sustained winds, and the strongest to affect Louisiana since Hurricane Camille brought category 5 winds to the rural southeast portion of the state. The twelfth named storm, fourth hurricane, and first major storm on the record-breaking 2020 Atlantic hurricane season, Laura formed from a tropical wave that moved off the coast of West Africa on August 16, and formed into a tropical depression by August 20. On August 21, Laura strengthened into a tropical storm, becoming the earliest twelfth named storm, and breaking 1995's Hurricane Luis's record by eight days.

Laura first moved over the Lesser Antilles and brushing Puerto Rico as a tropical storm, before making landfall in the resort city of Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, killing four people in the Dominican Republic and 31 in Haiti. The storm then moved over the entire island of Cuba, forcing the evacuation of more than 260,000 people. Then, the outer rainbands of Laura moved over parts of the Florida Keys and Southern Florida. It then moved over the warm Gulf of Mexico, strengthening slowly at first, before undergoing rapid intensification by August 26. Later that day, Laura became a major hurricane, and soon reached a peak intensity of 150, making it a Category 4 hurricane.

Then, just a couple of hours after reaching peak intensity, at 6:00 UCT on August 27, Laura made landfall in Cameron, Louisiana just below peak intensity with 150 mph (240 km/h) and a pressure of 939 mbar, at the same wind speed of the 1856 Last Island hurricane. It was the 10th strongest tropical cyclone to ever hit the United States in terms of wind speed, killed 42 people in the U.S,  and caused $19 billion in damage on the Gulf Coast of the United States and inland areas. After landfall, Laura weakened, falling to tropical storm status later in the day, and tropical depression status over Arkansas the next day. On August 29, Laura weakened to a remnant low over Kentucky, before being absorbed by an extratropical cyclone over the East Coast. Overall, Laura caused $19.1 billion in damage and killed 81 people. Areas that were badly affected by Laura, mostly southeastern Texas and southwestern Louisiana, were badly affected by more flooding and strong winds during Hurricane Delta around six weeks later.

[[Sarah Emma Edmonds]]

CATEGORIES: 1841 births, 1898 deaths, Canadian people, Military personnel of the American Civil War, Spies

Sarah Emma Edmonds (December 1841 – September 5, 1898), was a Canadian-conceived lady who is referred to for filling in as a man with the Union Army during the American Civil War. In 1992, she was enlisted into the Michigan Women's Hall of Fame.Born in 1841 in New Brunswick, at that point a British settlement, Edmonds grew up with her sisters on their family's homestead close Magaguadavic Lake, not a long way from the outskirt with the State of Maine. Edmonds fled home at age fifteen to get away from a masterminded marriage and the maltreatment of her dad, who needed a child rather than a girl. Supported by her mom, who herself wedded youthful, Edmonds got away from the marriage and eventually embraced the appearance of Franklin Thompson to travel simpler. A male mask permitted Edmonds to eat, travel, and work freely. Intersection into the United States of America, Edmonds worked for an effective Bible book retailer and distributer in Hartford, Connecticut.

Sarah Emma Edmonds' enthusiasm for experience was started by a book she read in her childhood by Maturin Murray Ballou called Fanny Campbell, the Female Pirate Captain', recounting to the account of Fanny Campbell and her undertakings on a privateer transport during the American Revolution while dressed as a lady Fanny stayed dressed as a man so as to seek after different experiences, to which Edmonds credits her longing to dress in drag. During the Civil War, on May 25, 1861, she enrolled in Company F of the second Michigan Infantry, otherwise called the Flint Union Grays. On her subsequent attempt, she masked herself as a man named "Franklin Flint Thompson," the center name potentially after the city she chipped in, Flint, Michigan. She felt that it was her obligation to serve her nation and was genuinely energetic towards her new nation. She from the start filled in as a male field nurture, taking an interest in a few crusades under General McClellan, including the First and Second Battle of Bull Run, Antietam, the Peninsula Campaign, Vicksburg, Fredericksburg, and others. Be that as it may, a few history specialists guarantee that these reports place her in more than one area simultaneously.

Edmonds' profession took a turn during the war when a Union covert agent in Richmond, Virginia was found and went before a terminating crew, and a companion, James Vesey, was executed in a snare. She exploited the open spot and the chance to vindicate her companion's demise. She applied for, and won, the situation as Franklin Thompson. Despite the fact that there is no verification in her military records that she really filled in as a government agent, she expounded broadly on her encounters masked as a covert agent during the war.needed

Making a trip into hostile area to assemble data required Emma to think of numerous masks. One camouflage required Edmonds to utilize silver nitrate to color her skin dark, wear a dark hairpiece, and stroll into the Confederacy masked as an individual of color by the name of Cuff. Some other time she entered as an Irish vendor lady by the name of Bridget O'Shea, guaranteeing that she was offering apples and cleanser to the officers. Once more, she was "working for the Confederates" as a dark laundress when a bundle of authentic papers dropped out of an official's coat. At the point when Thompson came back to the Union with the papers, the commanders were enchanted. Some other time, she filled in as an investigator in Kentucky as Charles Mayberry, revealing a Confederacy operator.

Edmonds' profession as Frank Thompson reached a conclusion when she traveled to Berry's Brigade so as to convey mail to Union powers. While trying to take an easy route, she was tossed into a jettison by her donkey before arriving at the detachment; Edmonds continued serious wounds and couldn't complete the outing before the First Battle of Bull Run had initiated. She relinquished her obligation in the military, expecting that on the off chance that she went to a military emergency clinic she would be found. She took a look at herself into a private medical clinic, expecting to come back to military life once she had recovered. When she recouped, be that as it may, she saw banners posting Frank Thompson as a coward. As opposed to come back to the military under another false name or as Frank Thompson, gambling execution for abandonment, she chose to fill in as a female medical caretaker at a Washington, D.C. clinic for injured troopers run by the United States Christian Commission. There was hypothesis that Edmonds may have abandoned on account of John Reid having been released months sooner. There is proof in his journal that she had referenced leaving before she had contracted jungle fever. Her individual warriors praises her military help, and significantly after her camouflage was found, they thought of her as a decent fighter. She was alluded to as a courageous warrior and was dynamic in each fight her regiment confronted.

[[Decision problem]]

CATEGORIES: Mathematics

A decision problem is a problem that can be posed as a yes-no question of the input values. It is a type of problem in mathematics. An example of a decision problem is deciding whether a given natural number is prime. Another is the problem "given two numbers x and y, does x evenly divide y?". The answer is either 'yes' or 'no' depending upon the values of x and y. A method for solving a decision problem, given in the form of an algorithm, is called a decision procedure for that problem. A decision procedure for the decision problem "given two numbers x and y, does x evenly divide y?" would give the steps for determining whether x evenly divides y. One such algorithm is long division. If the remainder is zero the answer is 'yes', otherwise it is 'no'. A decision problem which can be solved by an algorithm is called decidable.

Decision problems typically appear in mathematical questions of decidability, that is, the question of the existence of an effective method to determine the existence of some object or its membership in a set; some of the most important problems in mathematics are undecidable.

[[Pseudorandom number generator]]

CATEGORIES: Algorithms, Theoretical computer science

A pseudorandom number generator is a way that computers generate numbers. Computers aren't good at creating random numbers. We use an "algorithm" to make a random number.

A good analogy is a jar of (numbered) marbles. Humans can reach into the jar and grab "random" marbles. However, to understand pseudo random numbers, we must understand that this process is not random. We decided to reach into the bag based off of our brain giving us a signal to reach in this way, and the marbles themselves being arranged in a certain way.

Pseudo-Random Number Generators tell the computer to position the marbles in some way, and tells the computer to reach in and pick out the "random" marbles.

The initial position of the marbles is called the "seed." The seed is used to create the randomness. To come up with the seed some programs use time of day, while others convert background noise into a number.

When you need to get the next random number ("marble") the generator calculates it with some algorithm. It is based on the previous generated number, in turn, depending on the initial "seed." The algorithm is strict, it will always produce the same sequence of random numbers ("marbles") given the same initial "seed".

He was shot dead point-blank (from a very close range) by special forces officers on August 10, 2020, in Minsk. The government-run media tried to present it as something that happened through his own carelessness (failure to take the care that a cautious person usually takes).

He was shot by the police on the evening of August 10, 2020, near Pushkinskaya metro station in Minsk (after that it was said by the chief of GUBOPiK (a special police unit in Belarus) Nikolai Karpenkov). On February 2, 2021, TUT.BY got the results of the audio test of the record made by BYPOL. Talks on the killing of Alexander Taraikovsky and more are on the record.

[[Olfactores]]

CATEGORIES: Chordates, Taxonomy

Olfactores is a group, called a clade, in taxonomy.  Taxonomy is the way scientists put living things in groups to show how they are related to each other.  Olfactores is part of the phylum Chordata, animals with notochords. These are rods of tissue that form inside the developing embryo.  In many organisms, the notochord helps the spine or nervous system grow, but some animals have only a notochord and no spinal bones.  Olfactores contains Vetulicolia, Tunicata (Urochordata) and Vertebrata (also named Craniata). Most animals in Chordata are also in Olfactores. Only the animals in Cephalochordata are in Chordata but not Olfactores.

Scientists started to think taxonomy needed a special name for this group of living things in 2006.  They studied large numbers of data and saw a pattern that said the organisms in Olfactores had a relationship with each other that they did not have with cephalochordates. The name olfactores comes from Latin word olfactus for "sense of smell."  Scientists named this clade "Olfactores" because the animals in it grow a pharynx as part of their respiratory system and use it to breathe.  Cephalochordates, for example the lancelet, do not have respiratory systems and they do not have any organs whose job is only to smell things.

Davies' tree frog tadpoles are different from other tadpoles.  Their mouths have no beaks or teeth.

There are fewer Davies' tree frogs than there were.  The IUCN Red List says they are a vulnerable species.  Scientists say there are fewer Davies' tree frogs because human beings have changed their places where they live from forests, because of predators, and because there are not enough Davies' tree frogs in one place for them to find unrelated partners and make healthy offspring.  They also think the fungus disease chytridiomycosis could kill Davies' tree frogs but no scientist had seen any frogs sick with it as of 2007.

[[INaturalist]]

CATEGORIES: Science websites, Scientific organizations based in the United States, Citizen science organizations

iNaturalist is an American website where people post scientific information about plants, animals and other living things.  Usually, they send photographs of which living things they saw and say where and when they saw them.

iNaturalist works by crowdsourcing, by asking many, many people to work on the project.  Some of the people who send information to iNaturalist are professional scientists and some are citizen scientists, ordinary people who want to help scientific projects.  iNaturalist sends information to International Union for the Conservation of Nature and other projects that watch endangered animals and other populations. iNaturalist users can help park rangers and other people who work in forests find and identify invasive species, for example kudzu.  According to one park ranger from the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in the United States, rangers usually already know an invasive plant is in their park, but iNaturalist and programs like it help them find out exactly where it is.  Then they can gather people to remove it.

Parks, conservation programs and research teams in many countries have used iNaturalist, for example the United States, Canada and New Zealand.

[[The Book of the City of Ladies]]

CATEGORIES: 15th century books, 1405, Non-fiction books

The Book of the City of Ladies or Le Livre de la Cité des Dames (published in 1405), is perhaps Christine de Pizan's most famous literary work. Pizan originally wrote Le Livre de la Cité des Dames in Middle French but it was later translated into English (1999). The book serves as her formal response to Jean de Meun's popular Roman de la Rose. Pizan combats Meun's statements about women by creating an allegorical city of ladies. She defends women by collecting a wide array of famous women throughout history. These women are "housed" in the City of Ladies, which is an imaginary city from the book. As Pizan builds her city, she uses each famous woman as a building block for the walls and houses of the city. Each woman added to the city adds to Pizan's argument towards women as valued participants in society. She also advocates in favour of education for woman.

[[Australian lace-lid]]

CATEGORIES: Frogs, Animals of Australia

The Australian lace-lid, Day's big-eyed tree frog or lace-eyed tree frog (Ranoidea dayi) is a tree frog from Australia.  It lives in northeastern Queensland.

The adult frog is 5.0 cm long.  Unlike other male frogs, which can sing in groups, male Australian lace-lids are always at least 1 metre apart from each other when they sing.  Scientists think that the males compete against each other for the females, that they are territorial animals.

This frog lives in rainforests, especially mountain rainforests.  It will eat almost anything it can catch, usually invertebrates, for example spiders and insects.  Its large eyes help it hunt at night.

The female frog lays eggs under rocks in streams where the water flows fast.  The eggs are clear and 3.3 to 3.5 mm in diameter.  The tadpoles have strong tails so they can swim in the fast water.  The tadpoles eat algae on the bottom of the stream.  Tadpoles that hatch early become frogs in 3-4 months.  Tadpoles that hatch in the fall may stay tadpoles through the winter and become frogs the next year.

Scientists are not sure why this frog is endangered.  One idea is that feral pigs have come to their rainforests and rip up the low plants that the frog likes to climb on and hide in.  Another idea is that the fugal disease chytridiomycosis could be killing these frogs.

[[Kolkhoz]]

CATEGORIES: Economics, Soviet Union

Kolkhoz (ru-kolkhoz.ogg, a contraction of коллективное хозяйство, "collective ownership", kollektivnoye khozaystvo) is the name given to large farms that existed in the Soviet Union, and that were organised as a cooperative.  A group of people would run these farms; they also owned the means of production (like the machines they needed), but not the land, which was owned by the state. 

The state also ran farms during that time, which were known as Sovkhoz. These farms existed from about 1917, the date of the October Revolution, to 1991, when the Soviet Union was disbanded. In a Sovkhoz, people were employed, and did not own any means of production. 

As a collective farm, a kolkhoz was legally organized as a production cooperative. The Standard Charter of a kolkhoz is a model of cooperative principles in print. It speaks of the kolkhoz as a "form of agricultural production cooperative of peasants that voluntarily unite for the purpose of joint agricultural production based on ... collective labor". It asserts that "the kolkhoz is managed according to the principles of socialist self-management, democracy, and openness, with active participation of the members in decisions concerning all aspects of internal life".

They imposed detailed work programs and nominated their preferred managerial candidates.  Since the mid-1930s, the kolkhozes had been in effect  an offshoot of the state sector (although notionally they continued to be owned by their members). Nevertheless, in locations with particularly good land or if it happened to have capable management, some kolkhozes accumulated substantial sums of money in their bank accounts. As a result, many kolkhozes were formally nationalized by changing their status to sovkhozes. The faint dividing lines between collective and state farms were obliterated almost totally in the late 1960s, when Khrushchev's administration authorized a guaranteed wage to kolkhoz members, similarly to sovkhoz employees.  Essentially, his administration recognized their status as hired hands rather than authentic cooperative members. The guaranteed wage provision was incorporated in the 1969 version of the Standard Charter.

[[Cohabitation]]

Cohabitation is an arrangement where people who are romantically or sexually attracted to each other live together, without being married.

In these countries, a percentage of children are born outside marriage.

[[Wyoming toad]]

CATEGORIES: Toads

The Wyoming toad or Baxter's toad (Anaxyrus baxteri) is a toad that has become rare. The only living Wyoming toads are in captivity. For example, the Mortenson Lake National Wildlife Refuge in Wyoming breeds these toads. It was listed as "endangered" in 1984, and as "extinct in the wild" in 1991.  There were suddenly far fewer Wyoming toads around 1975 and the toad extremely rare by 1980. To prevent extinction, a captive breeding program was started in 1989 at the Thorne Williams Unit. This program produced enough young toads in the first few years to send toads to seven different zoos. In 1998, the Saratoga National Fish Hatchery received toads to breed. Between 1995 and 2006, when the remaining captive toads were moved from the Thorne Williams Unit to the Red Buttes Environmental Biology Laboratory south of Laramie, nearly 46,000 offspring had been produced at the Thorne Williams Unit and released back into the wild. Before the sharp declines occurred, this toad was classified as a subspecies of the Canadian toad.

In nature, the female toad leaves her eggs in the shallow parts of ponds and lakes.  The tadpoles swim in the warmest parts of the water.

Adult frogs look for food during the day and hide at night.  Sometimes they go into burrows dug by rodents.  Adult frogs eat mostly ants but they also eat beetles and other animals without backbones.

Scientists are not sure why the Wyoming toad started to die out in the 1970s.  They think it might have been that people were using an insect-killing chemical called Baytex, that seagulls, pelicans and raccoons were eating the toads, or that irrigation for hay growing changed their living space.

[[Chalcid wasp]]

CATEGORIES: Wasps, Parasitoids

The chalcid wasps are formally called the Chalcidoidea. They are a superfamily of parasitoid wasps. They have a huge number of species, estimated as over 500,000 (half a million). The superfamily includes 22 families. The data included morphology and ribosomal 18S data. The researchers comment that only about 22,506 species of the half-million have been formally described.

Most of the species are parasitic on other kinds of insect. They attack the egg or larval stages of at least 12 different insect orders. When that insect is itself a parasitoid, then the chalcid is called a hyperparasitoid. Chalcids are sometimes used to control crop pests. A few chalcids  actually eat plants, and the most famous of these are the fig wasps.

There are 19 living families of chalcids.

Spaghetti Junction is a motorway interchange in Birmingham, England. It is junction 6 of the M6 motorway. 

The junction's official name is Gravelly Hill Interchange, but this name is not used very often. The junction links the M6 with the A38(M) motorway which passes through Birmingham. The interchange was opened in 24 May 1972, and was given its popular name by local journalists.

The junction covers 30 acres, serves 18 routes and includes 4 km (2.5 miles) of slip roads. There are five levels, and it flies over two railway lines, three canals and two rivers. It took nearly four years to build it, against an estimated three years. It cost £8 million, which is a deceptively small amount. It can only be understood by realising the extent of monetary inflation during the past half century.

The junction has had a lot of repair work done a number of times since it was built. There is very heavy traffic through the junction, and there were some alleged cost-saving measures during its construction.
