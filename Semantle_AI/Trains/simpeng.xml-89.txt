[[Dialectical materialism]]

CATEGORIES: Philosophy of science

Dialectical materialism is a philosophy of science, history, and nature. It was developed in Europe and  is based on the writings of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels.   Marxist dialectics say that  real-world condition such as  class, labor, and socioeconomic interactions are important. This is a contrast to Hegelian dialectic, which says that contradictions in material phenomena can be resolved by analyzing them and finding a solution. Marx thought that the most effective solution to the problems caused by such contradictory phenomena was to address and rearrange the systems of social organization at the root of the problems.

Dialectical materialism accepts that the natural world changes. New qualitiews of being will come to light with each change. . As Z. A. Jordan noted, "Engels made constant use of the metaphysical insight that the higher level of existence emerges from and has its roots in the lower; that the higher level constitutes a new order of being with its irreducible laws; and that this process of evolutionary advance is governed by laws of development which reflect basic properties of 'matter in motion as a whole'."

The formulation of the Soviet version of dialectical and historical materialism in the 1930s by Joseph Stalin and his associates (such as in Stalin's book Dialectical and Historical Materialism) became the official Soviet interpretation of Marxism.

The American Diabetes Association, however, recommends against eating more fiber than needed. That's because this may case digestive problems, like diarrhea, flatulence and bloating.

CATEGORIES: History of California

The California missions were made by Spain and were located in Alta California, now known as just California. The purpose of these missions were to bring Christianity to the natives. Many of the cities you see today in California are named after the missions. Spain sent priests and soldiers to build the missions. The leader of the priests was Junipero Serra. They often used violence to force the natives into helping to build their missions. Other times they would bribe the natives, promising to give them spices and money. The natives were forced to stay at the missions until their training was complete. As a result, many natives tried to escape. These natives were brought back to the mission, beaten, and punished. The soldiers would often beat the natives in public to show the natives what would be done if they didn't follow the rules. The end of the mission era in Alta California was after Mexico was finally free from Spain. Mexico decided that they would close down the missions. Today, the missions of California are used as wedding places, churches, and museums.

The 21 missions of California are listed in order by the date that they were made.

[[Corn smut]]

CATEGORIES: Diseases and disorders of plants, Fungi

Corn smut is a disease that affects corn, which is also called maize.  The fungus Ustilago maydis causes corn smut.

Lumps of growing tissue called galls grow on the corn.  They can grow on the ears, leaves or stalks.  Corn is more likely to have corn smut if it has been cut by machines or hailstones.

Farmers can stop corn smut by using corn that has been bred to be strong against the fungus.  Farmers can also stop corn smut by crop rotation.  This is because the fungus can wait in the soil over the winter for the next crop.  If the corn is not in the same field each year, it is harder for corn smut to reach new corn plants.

Corn smut is safe to eat, and chefs cook it.

[[Isomerization]]

CATEGORIES: Chemistry

Isomerization is a thing that happens to molecules and parts of molecules.

Isomerization is when a molecule or part of a molecule changes shape but still has the same number of each kind of atom.  The atoms change places, but they do not go away.  No new atoms come.

For example, when a ketose group changes to an aldose group, that is isomerization because both groups are -C2H3O2.  They have two carbon atoms, three hydrogen atoms, and two oxygen atoms.  In the ketose group, the first carbon has a double bond to an oxygen and a single bond to the other carbon.  In the aldose group, the second carbon has the double bond to the oxygen, and the hydrogen atoms are in different places.  But they both have the same number of each kind of atom.

[[Meitei wedding]]

CATEGORIES: Meitei culture, Meitei religion

Meitei marriage or Manipuri wedding customs ("Luhongba" or "Yum-Paanba") are the traditions and practices that relate to wedding ceremonies and marriage rituals prevailing within the Meitei culture. The ceremonies and customs have changed greatly in the past 350 years. Original traditional Meitei weddings are supposed to be very similar to modern matrimonial practices of the Sanamahists and rural weddings (in Loi villages of Manipur). Notably, modern day Sanamahist matrimonial practices are in fact, the original true traditional Meitei wedding without the influence of foreign culture.

No matter what religion one follows, the Meiteis are not allowed to marry between the persons of the same salai (clan). Else, severe punishment or banishment from the society (colony) is the usual result in Meitei culture.

Generally, in urban areas, monogamy is common while in rural areas, polygamy is not rare.

The marriage process usually starts with the meeting between the couple's families and the consultation on the two's horoscopes. If everything is fine, the marriage day will be fixed and finally, the partners will be wedded.

Regarding the cultural diversity of the Meitei ethnicity, there are the adherents of Sanamahism, Hinduism, Christianity and Islam.

During early times, there were strong religious barriers between the castes inside the Meitei ethnicity. For instance, a general Meitei (either Hindu or Sanamahist) cannot marry a person who belongs to Meitei Pangal (Manipuri Muslim) or Meitei Bishnupriya (Bishnupriya Manipuri) communities.

In the end, Podolia got divided between Poland, who got western Podolia, and the Soviet Union, who got eastern Podolia. This situation existed until World War II, when the Soviet Union conquered all of Podolia.

A cadet branch is the part of a family that is descended from a younger son (or daughter). Cadet branches are important for royal succession since if the main royal branch runs out of people (or out of males, if females are not allowed to inherit the throne), then a cadet branch would inherit the throne. However, sometimes there were also cases where a cadet branch acquired a throne before the main royal branch actually ran out of males, such as when Louis-Philippe of France became French King after Charles X of France abdicated due to the Revolution of 1830 even though Charles X still had a surviving son and grandson of his own during this time.

Its life style is rather similar to the salmon. The adults live in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean, but come up rivers to breed. They have vanished from the dinner table because the Victorians build weirs in the Severn which stopped the fish getting to their breeding grounds  The Severn, in SW England, is vital to the fish. It is by far the largest river opening in that part of the Atlantic. Overfishing, pollution and habitat destruction have also helped the shad's decline.

[[Compression artifact]]

CATEGORIES: Data structures

A compression artifact (or artefact) is a deliberate visible change in media (including images, audio, and video). It is caused by lossy compression. Lossy data compression removes some of the media's data. This way the data becomes small enough to be stored in the desired disk or transmitted inside the available bandwidth. If the compressor cannot store enough data in the compressed form, the result is a loss of quality, or introduction of artifacts.

The most common digital compression artifacts are DCT blocks. This is caused by the discrete cosine transform (DCT) compression algorithm used in many digital media, such as JPEG image compression, MP3 digital audio, and MPEG video coding formats. 

These compression artifacts appear when heavy compression is applied. It occurs often in common digital media, such as DVDs, common computer file formats such as JPEG, MP3 and MPEG files. It also occurs in some other alternatives to the compact disc like the as Sony's MiniDisc format. Uncompressed media (such as on Laserdiscs and WAV files) or losslessly compressed media (such as FLAC or PNG) do not suffer from compression artifacts.

Shaggs' Own Thing is a 1982 compilation album with some music by The Shaggs from a recording session in 1975 on it. The music did not come out because Austin Wiggin (the band members' father and manager) died and the band ended after that.

The Shaggs' previous album, Philosophy of the World, from 1969, was released again in 1980, and was popular, which is why this album was made. Philosophy of the World only has original songs, which were played badly in a unique way. Shaggs' Own Thing has other original songs, covers of popular songs from the early 1970s and a new version of "My Pal Foot Foot", which was from Philosophy of the World, and sounds better because they practiced playing music, had learned the basics of popular music, had better singing voices and could play in pop music styles of the time better. Many people who like the band's music prefer the music of their earlier style, so they ignore this album.

The two male singers in Shaggs' Own Thing are Austin Wiggin Jr. and his adolescent son Robert.

[[Übermensch]]

CATEGORIES: Philosophy

Übermensch is a concept from philosophy. The concept is used to describe a human that has outgrown himself or herself, that is no longer burdened by the sorrows of ordinary people. Today, the concept is mainly known from the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche who, in his 1883 book Thus Spoke Zarathustra (German: Also sprach Zarathustra), Nietzsche has his character Zarathustra suggest the Übermensch as a goal for humanity to set for itself. Nietzsche thought that the moral values of the Catholic Church were outdated. For him, an Übermensch is one that is able to develop moral values which are not based on religion, but rather, rooted in Nihilism.  When Nietsche used the term, he took most of the ideas from the French philosopher Claude Adrien Helvétius. Helvetius used the term homme supérieur.

The idea itself  is much older: Dionysius of Halicarnassus talked about a "hyperanthropos" (hyper: above, anthropos: human) in the first century BC. He lived c. 60  – after 7 BC) and was a Greek historian and teacher of rhetoric.

Lucian used the term, to talk about noblemen, who would be "cut back to their real size" in the realm of the dead. In his Divine Comedy, Dante used the hapax legomenon transhumanar to refer to the Übermensch. Transhumanar is a verb.  The writings of Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite influenced Dante Pseudo-Dyonysius is an early Christian writer from Syria, who lived in the 6th century. He is not known by name, but used the pen name Dionysius Areopagita. Dionysius Areopagita lived in the 1st century, and was one of the bishops of Athens. Thomas Aquinas, Augustine of Hippo, and Matthew also had similar ideas.

[[Untermensch]]

CATEGORIES: Racism

Untermensch (plural: Untermenschen)  is a term many racist ideologiers use. It can be translated as sub-human or under-human. Nietzsche, and others developed the term Übermensch, to refer to someone who has outgrown himself, and who no longer has all the problems ordinary people have For the Nazis, the Übermensch was someone of Aryan descent. The Untermensch, on the other hand was used for all the people of the races seen as inferior, such as the Jews, the Slavic people, gypsies or black people. 

When the Nazis invaded the Soviet Union, Heinrich Himmler published a booklet, called "Der Untermensch". This brochure was distributed in Germany: it was made to increase the hatred towards the people of the Soviet Union (note: not the Slavic people, the term Slavic people never occurs in the brochure). The booklet was very popular, also with the German allies, such as the people in Croatia, Slovakia or Bulgaria. These people received copies in their own language. The booklet didn't provide much information about the Soviet union, it was mainly used to race hatred. Some people in the Nazi government were against the publication of the booklet: they thought they could convince the common people of the Soviet Union to fight against the Bolsheviks in power. During 1942, the publication of the booklet was stopped.

In 1924, Fritz Lang published his movie Die Nibelungen, where he shows that the smith Mime (also called Mimir) as an Untermensch. During the Wochenshau, the Nazis showed several movies with Russian people in simple wooden houses, travelling on badly maintained roads. This was done to show the German people how inferior the people of the Soviet Union were. Needless to say: these clips also were propaganda. 

Movies that were made after the second world war, also show the concept of Untermensch: Louis de Funès has a few of these movies: In his movies, the term is not used for people of other nations seen as inferior, but rather: for people of the own nations, who have character traits that are seen as bad.

During the Second World War, Japan expanded to China and in Southeast Asia. During that time, prisoners of war and civilians were used for experiments on humans. Unit 731 became known for experiments with chemiclal agents and pathogens, such as those causingthe plague, or smallpox. They also did experiments with poison gas. In Japanese, the people were called maruta, which can be translated as wood, or material. This a similar value judgement than that of Untermensch.

[[Mohammed Baqir al-Hakim]]

CATEGORIES: 1939 births, 2003 deaths

Ayatollah Sayed Mohammed Baqir (or Bakr) al-Hakim (1939 - August 29, 2003) was the foremost Shia Muslim leader in Iraq until his assassination in a terrorist bombing that killed him and 80 others as they were leaving a mosque in Najaf.  He was the son of Ayatollah Muhsin Al-Hakim, the worldwide leader of Shia Muslims from 1955 to 1970.

Al-Hakim co-founded the modern Islamist political movement in Iraq in the 1960s, along with Ayatollah Sayed Mohammed Baqir Al-Sadr, with whom he worked closely until the latter's death in 1980.  Though not among the most hard-line of Islamists, Al-Hakim was seen as dangerous by the ruling Baath regime, largely because of his agitation on behalf of Iraq's majority Shia population (the ruling regime was comprised mostly of Sunnis).  This led to his arrest in 1972, but he was released shortly thereafter.

He was partially blamed for the uprising in Najaf that occured in February 1977, and so was arrested again, and this time sentenced to life imprisonment. However, his sentence was commuted and he was released in July 1979. The subsequent eruption of war between Iraq and (largely Shia) Iran led to an ever-increasing distrust of Iraq's Shia population by the rulling Baath party; combined with his previous arrests, this convinced Al-Hakim that it was impossible to continue his Shia advocacy in Iraq, and in 1980 he fled to Iran.

Safely in Iran, Al-Hakim became an open enemy of the Baathists, forming the Supreme Council of the Islamic Resistance in Iraq (SCIRI), a revolutionary group dedicated to overthrowing Saddam Hussein's regime.  In 1983, Hussein responded by arresting 125 members of Al-Hakim's family who had remained in Iraq, and executing 18 of them.  This further embittered Al-Hakim's view of the Baathists in general and Hussein in particular.  With Iranian aid, SCIRI became an armed resistance group, periodically making cross-border attacks on Iraqi facilities, maintaining covert connections with resistance elements within the country, and generally being a perennial thorn in Hussein's side.

Al-Hakim returned to Iraq in May 2003 following the overthrow of Hussein's regime by the US-led invasion of Iraq.  There he emerged as one of the most influential Iraqi leaders, with his longtime opposition to Hussein gaining him immense credibility, especially among the majority Shia population.

Initially he was very critical of the US-led occupation of Iraq, saying "we do not put confidence in the Americans, they have always acted against the interests of the Iraqi people" and urging Iraqis not to follow the US's administration's dictates.  However, he did give the US credit for overthrowing the hated Baathist regime, and through the summer of 2003 indicated some willingness to work with the Americans in setting up a civilian government in Iraq.  By the time of his death, he remained distrustful, but urged Iraqis to abandon violence, at least for the time being, and give the interim government a chance to earn their trust.

It is unclear (as of late August 2003) who was behind the massive bomb attack that killed him.  A spokesman for SCIRI in London suggested that supporters of Saddam Hussein may have been behind the attack; others suggest it may have been orchestrated by Sunnis not necessarily connected to Hussein who are opposed to the increasing Shia influence in the country; a few suggest it may have been carried out by hard-line Shia groups critical of Al-Hakim's increasingly conciliatory line towards the United States.  However, as his assassination comes in the midst of a pattern of violence against Shia clerics in Najaf in recent weeks (Al-Hakim is the fourth to be assassinated), it is considered likely that the attack was motivated by anti-Shia sentiment rather than by a conflict between Shia moderates and hardliners.

CATEGORIES: 1873 births, 1960 deaths, Governors of Oregon

Jay Bowerman (August 15, 1876 – October 25, 1957) was an American politician, a Republican, who served most notably as the 13th Governor of Oregon.

Bowerman was born in Hesper, Iowa, the son of Daniel and Lydia (Battey) Bowerman. His siblings were named Ralph,  Martha and Mary.

He received his early education in public schools of Hesper, then moved to Salem, Oregon in 1893. He entered Willamette University that same year and graduated with a law degree in 1896 at the age of twenty. He was admitted to the Oregon Bar the following year, practicing law in Salem until 1899. He then moved to Condon, in Gilliam County, Oregon, where he lived for the next twelve years. There he became a law partner of H. H. Henricks. Bowerman's service in the Spanish-American War briefly interrupted his practice of the law. 

He married Elizabeth Hoover in 1903 and together they had three children: William, Daniel and Elizabeth. However, the couple divorced and Bowerman married Wayfe Hockett in 1914; this marriage produced two further children, Sally and Jayne. 

He was elected to the Oregon State Senate from Gilliam County in 1904 and was reelected four years later. He served as president of that body from 1909 to 1911. When Governor Frank W. Benson was incapacitated by ill health in June 1910, he asked Bowerman. as President of the Senate, to assume gubernatorial responsibilities. On June 16, 1910, at age thirty-three, Bowerman became Acting Governor. 

Mindful of bureaucratic economy, Bowerman advocated establishment of a Board of Control to administer the state institutions, which would permit fiscal savings by combined purchasing for state institutions through the office of a single purchasing agent. However, the Board of Control was not established until the administration of his successor. He acted to reduce the risk of loss through bank failure by prohibiting Oregon bankers from the use of speculative stock as assets if they had actively promoted that stock. In 1904 the citizens of Oregon adopted a direct primary law prohibiting party nominating conventions. But establishment Republicans, unwilling to relinquish party control over nominations, held an "assembly" in 1910 at which they nominated Bowerman as their candidate for governor. He was therefore cast in the role of opponent of the "Oregon System" of direct government by his Democratic gubernatorial rival, Oswald West. Bowerman campaigned on a platform supporting modernized highway systems, increased economies in the administration of government, and continued tight control of state land management. West defeated him, however, 54,853 votes to 48,751.

After leaving the office of governor on January 8, 1911, Bowerman moved to Portland, where he resumed the practice of law. He was reelected President of the State Senate but retired following the 1911 session. As a private citizen he actively supported Oregon's first statewide bond issue for highway construction, a $6,000,000 proposal. He also served as an active lobbyist for years at the State Legislature. He died in Portland in 1957.

West was born in Ontario, Canada but moved to Salem, Oregon with his family at the age of four where he attended school and eventually went into banking.  After several years as a banker in Salem and Astoria, Oregon and a six month stint searching for gold in Alaska West gained an appointment to the State Land Commission.  He proved effective in his position with the State Land Commission recovering almost 1 million acres of fraudulently held state land. After leaving the Land Commission he earned a term the Oregon Railroad Commission where he again found a great deal of success.

In 1910 he gained the Democratic nomination for Governor and went on to defeat his opponent and take the office.  While in office West defended what he called the "Oregon System" which included initiative and referendum systems still in use in many western American states today.  These systems led to women's suffrage, prohibition  and various workers rights laws being put in to action under his lead.  All pet issues of Governor West.

West's most notable work was in protecting the state's natural resources.  It was under his administration the beaches bordering the Pacific Ocean were protected for public use; the office of State Forester and the Bureau of Forestry were established; and the Fish Commission and Game Commission were created.

West served only one term, opting not to run for re-election in the 1914 election.  He instead moved his family to Portland, Oregon where he practiced law.  He died in Portland on August 22, 1960.

Oswald West State Park on the Oregon coast was named in his honor.

[[Memoir of Japanese Assassinations]]

Memoir of Japanese Assassinations (日本暗殺秘録, Nihon ansatsu hiroku) is a 1969 Japanese historical drama film written and directed by Sadao Nakajima. The movie was based on a 1958 novel Secret Assassination by historian Tadashi Suzuki. This anthology film consists of nine incidents in the late 19th and early 20th centuries when assassins changed the course of Japanese history.

Much like the more well-known movie Tora! Tora! Tora!, which would premiere a year later in 1970, Memoirs of Japanese Assassins in a docudrama, which some might find boring, but  have a certain love for these types of historical films. Unlike Tora Tora Tora, this movie has no overall plot or protagonist and is just a series of scenes.

Despite being a country with low crime, political assassination has a long history in Japan. Although not nearly as common before World War II, there have been assassinations post-1945, most notably when 17 year old nationalist Otoya Yamaguchi killed chairman of the Japan Socialist Party Inejiro Asanuma on live TV in 1960.

Japanese assassins occupied a special place in the Japanese psyche. Often times, the sincerity of their beliefs were given consideration, and if they were motivated by selfless causes, their punishments were often less severe than a nonpolitical murder. That being said, this was not the case of all assassinations, with Japanese society far more divided than some postwar historians have portrayed it as, i.e. a regimented military dictatorship.

The assassinations depicted alternate between cold detachment and a sympathetic biopic.

(! style="text-align:left; margin:auto; width:400px;"

The 2020 Iowa Democratic caucuses were the first votes to decide the nominee in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries for the 2020 United States presidential election, taking place on 3 February 2020. The winner was Pete Buttigieg, which made him the first openly gay person to win a presidential contest. The Iowa caucuses are closed caucuses, only allowing for people who are registered as a person in the Democratic Party to vote. Iowa gives 49 delegates to the 2020 Democratic National Convention, of which 41 are pledged delegates given to candidates based on the results of the caucuses.

After a three day delay in reporting the votes, the Iowa Democratic Party announced that Buttigieg had been awarded two more delegates than Sanders, but Sanders had won the popular vote in the state. Most of the media outlets would say that Buttigieg would be the winner, but the Associated Press declined to declare who would be the winner until all recount voting processes had been finished. The official result and calculation of pledged delegates was delayed again by a further six days after the election as they needed to correct the results from 3.1% (55) of the precincts. Both Buttigieg and Sanders then requested a recanvass for 8.1% of the official results, which narrowed Buttigieg's lead over Sanders to 0.08 SDEs.

The caucuses would be controversial because of the delays in the reporting of the results. Much of the delay was as a result of the mobile application used to report voting totals. More controversy started because of the errors and continued changing in the calculation and reporting of the SDEs. The Iowa Democratic Party chair would resign on the 12 February 2020 because of the criticism of the reporting.

[[Madlax]]

CATEGORIES: Light novels, 2004 anime television series

Madlax is an 26-episode Japanese anime television series produced in 2004 by the Bee Train animation studio. Kōichi Mashimo directed Madlax and the soundtrack was composed by Yuki Kajiura. 

The story turns to two young women named Margaret and Madlax, who apparently have little in common and do not know of the other's existence at the beginning. Madlax is a legendary mercenary and assassin in the fictional civil war-torn country of Gazth-Sonika, who cannot remember her past or indeed her real name before twelve years ago, when the war started. The other main character is Margaret Burton, the sole heir of a wealthy aristocratic family in the peaceful European country Nafrece. Twelve years before the story begins, an airliner Margaret and her mother were on crashed over Gazth-Sonika, and its passengers, as well as Margaret's father who led the rescuers, have been missing ever since. Margaret, however, mysteriously traveled back to Nafrece on her own, losing her memories prior to her return; the only thing she recalls is a single word, "Madlax". With this thread linking the two girls, they both independently start investigating the powerful crime syndicate Enfant after its enigmatic mastermind shows interest in both of them.

Madlax was produced as a spiritual successor to the studio's earlier project, Noir, and together with El Cazador de la Bruja, these series constitute a trilogy exploring the "girls-with-guns" genre. The production of Madlax began in 2002 but it didn't last until Yōsuke Kuroda joined the project that the series took its final form. While reviewers noted the resulting similarities between Noir and Madlax, they also acknowledged the differences, such as the latter's less episodic and more plot-driven style and, in particular contrast to the predominantly realistic Noir, incorporation of many supernatural elements, which the audience must often describe without further explanation.

[[Sea of Japan naming dispute]]

CATEGORIES: Geography of South Korea, Geography of Japan, Articles containing Japanese-language text, Geography of Russia

There is a body of water between the Japanese islands, Russia, North and South Korea. The countries affected have not been able to agree on a common name for this body of water. So far, most countries called it Sea of Japan. North and South Korea do not want this name, they suggested to call it East Sea, or East Sea of Korea. In 1992, both Koreas raised concerns about the name, at the Sixth United Nations Conference on the Standardization of Geographical Names.   The Japanese government says that only the name  "Sea of Japan" (日本海) should be used. South Korea supports the alternative name "East Sea" (Korean: 동해; Hanja: 東海). North Korea supports the name "East Sea of Korea" (Korean: 조선동해; Hanja: 朝鮮東海).  Currently, most international maps and documents use either the name Sea of Japan (or a translation) by itself, or include both the name Sea of Japan and East Sea. Very often, the name East Sea  is listed in parentheses or otherwise marked as an alternative.  The International Hydrographic Organization is responsible for naming bodies of water around the world. In 2012, it decided it was still unable to change the 1953 version of its publication S-23 – Limits of Oceans and Seas, which includes only the single name "Sea of Japan", to include "East Sea" together with "Sea of Japan".

The countries have given different arguments, for their naming proposition, but each name has its problems:

The International Hydrographic organisation made a resolution in 1974. In this resolution, it stated that in the case that the countries cannot agree on a common name for a body of water, all names should be accepted. However, Japan argues that the resolution only applies to the bays and straits which are shared by multiple countries, and in case of high seas such as the Sea of Japan, it is not applicable. Japan also cites the United Nations’ policy for using the Sea of Japan as an official name for their reasoning.

[[Planned obsolescence]]

CATEGORIES: Economics

Planned obsolescence (also called built-in obsolescence or premature obsolescence) is an idea in economics and product design. Planned obsolescence is when someone makes a product so that it will wear out after only a short time. It will either stop working, work much worse than before, or be unfashionable.  This way, the person who bought the product must buy a new one sooner than if the old product had lasted a long time. This is often called  "shortening the replacement cycle." 

Planned obsolescence works when company selling the product has few or no other companies making the same product, because the consumer has few choices. Before choosing this strategy, the producer has to make sure that the consumer will likely buy from them again and not from someone else. Usually, there is information asymmetry: the producer knows how long the product was designed to last, and the consumer does not. However, when many companies make the same product, they compete. Then product lifespans often increase.  In the 1960s and 1970s, the first Japanese cars were sold in America. Because they had longer lifespans than the American car models, American car manufacturers were forced to build cars that lasted longer.

[[Drug lord]]

CATEGORIES: Organized crime, Drug traffickers

A drug lord, also called a drug kingpin is a criminal boss who controls a sizable network of the people involved in the illegal drug trade. Such people are often hard to bring to justice, for they are not usually in possession of something illegal.

Examples of drug lords are Pablo Escobar, Griselda Blanco, Frank Lucas, Joaquín Guzmán and Manuel Noriega.

Drug lords have started breaking the larger drug cartels into much smaller groups. With newer technology, drug lords are able to manage their business better from behind the scenes. They usually keep themselves off the FBI and DEA lists. The smaller drug cartels are proving to be safer and make more money for those involved.

[[David's Sling]]

David's Sling (Kela David), formerly known as Magic Wand (Sharvit Ksamim), is an Israel Defense Forces military system being jointly developed by the Israeli defense contractor Rafael Advanced Defense Systems and the American defense contractor Raytheon, designed to block enemy planes, drones, tactical ballistic missiles, medium- to long-range rockets and cruise missiles, fired at ranges from 40 km (24.85 miles) to 300 km (186.41 miles). David's Sling is meant to replace the MIM-23 Hawk and MIM-104 Patriot in the Israeli arsenal.

The system's Stunner missile is designed to stop the newest generation of tactical ballistic missiles at low altitude, such as the Russian Iskander and the Chinese DF-15 using an on-board dual CCD/IR seekers to maqke out between decoys and the actual warhead of the missile, in addition to tracking by Elta EL/M-2084 Active electronically scanned array multi-mode radar. The multi-stage interceptor consists of a solid-fuel rocket motor booster, followed by an irregular kill vehicle with advanced steering for super-workability during the kill-stage. A three-pulse motor provides additional acceleration and maneuverability during the terminal phase. David's Sling became operational in April 2017.

David's Sling is meant to support the second tier of Israel's theater missile defense system.  The name David's Sling comes from the biblical story of David and Goliath. It will form one level of Israel's future multi-tiered missile defense system that Israel is developing, which will also include Arrow 2, Arrow 3, Iron Dome, and Barak 8 and Iron Beam from as early as 2020.

[[Economies of scale]]

CATEGORIES: Economics

In economics, economies of scale means that when more units of a product are made at the same time, the cost it takes to produce a single unit will go down. When making a product, there is a maximum capacity that can be made, at a given time. This capacity depends  on the ways in which the product is made. If it is made by machines, these machines have a maximum number they can produce. Wanting to produce more than this number means new machines (or a new way to make these products) are needed. Adam Smith first had this idea of economy of scale, which he obtained through division of labour. 

The opposite of economies of scale are diseconomies of scale.

[[2021 Texas power crisis]]

CATEGORIES: February 2021 events, 21st century in Houston, Texas

In February 2021, the state of Texas had a major power crisis, because of three winter storms in the United States on February 10–11, 13–17, and 15–20. The crisis was caused by a massive electricity generation failure in the state of Texas; and caused shortages of water, food, and heat. 

More than 4.5 million homes and businesses were left without power, some for several days. At least 151 people were killed. The total damage is estimated to be between $100 billion and $200 billion, making it as expensive as Hurricane Harvey and other major disasters.

The Texas crisis's proximate causes were two unanticipated shocks induced from the sub-zero temperatures (‑2˚ F in Dallas): a failure of conventional (thermal) generating supply, mostly from lack of natural gas, and a surge in electricity demand. Inadequate winterization caused freezing of the gas supply and many plants' control instruments. In a system with a winter peak of 66 GW, about 30 GW of thermal plants were unavailable. In its worst-case extreme-winter analysis, ERCOT had expected a loss of 14 GW of thermal resources. The February storm caused more than double the anticipated thermal outages.

Simultaneously, electric heaters created a powerful surge in demand. About 61% of Texans rely on electric heat, mostly low-efficiency resistance heat, in poorly insulated homes — a seemingly sensible choice in a warm climate with cheap electricity, where home heating is often unnecessary. The demand surge caused by the cold came to about 20 GW or one-third of the winter peak. ERCOT based its worst-case analysis on a 2011 winter storm, the most severe cold-weather event in Texas in twenty years. The 2021 storm was much worse than that of 2011. It created an unexpected and unsupportable demand surge.

[[RNA-Seq]]

CATEGORIES: RNA

[[file:Summary_of_RNA-Seq.svg|thumb|500px|Summary of RNA-Seq. In the organism, genes are transcribed and (in a eukaryotic organism) spliced to produce mature mRNA transcripts (red). The mRNA is got from the organism, fragmented and reverse-transcribed into stable double-stranded (ds) cDNA (blue). The ds-cDNA is sequenced using high-throughput, short-read sequencing methods. 

These sequences can then be compared to a reference genome sequence to see which genome regions were being transcribed. This data shows where expressed genes are, their relative expression levels, and any alternative splice variants.]]

RNA-Seq (short for "RNA sequencing") is a technique to get snapshots of the continuously changing RNA landscape in a cell.

RNA is a nucleic acid with roles in when, where, and by how much genes are turned on. Classically, sections of DNA are copied to RNA which are decoded into proteins that carry out cellular functions. 

RNAs also have many roles that fall outside this framework. RNA-Seq is typically used to analyze the amount of each gene's RNA in experimental samples. For example, in gene expression and changes made during RNA processing (alternative splicing, editing, mutations, or fusions between RNAs). RNA-Seq requires molecular biology and computational steps. 

Recent advances in RNA-Seq include the ability to study single cells and entire single RNA molecules. It has broad applications in the life sciences from agriculture to medicine.

The "Leva del Biberón" (also known as the "Quinta del Biberón ", baby bottle in Spanish) was the name given to the levies of 1938 and 1939 throughout the territory that republican Spain still controlled during the last years of the Spanish civil war . Mobilized by order of the President of the Second Spanish Republic, Manuel Azaña, at the end of April 1938. At that time, Franco's troops had attacked Lérida, Gandesa, Balaguer, Tremp and Camarasa and were taking control of the last points of republican resistance.

In total, some 30,000 young people were called up,  coming from all over the national territory on the Republican side: Murcia, Catalonia, Old Castilla and Valencia, among others. They were under the command of Lluís Companys, among whom would be counted future personalities such as Jesús Blasco. First, they had to cover auxiliary tasks, but on July 25, 1938, they were already participating in the Republican offensive of the Battle of the Ebro, the vast majority being minors, reaching, some as children, only 14 years old.

It is believed that it received this name when Federica Montseny referred to all of them in this way: “Seventeen years old? but they still are sucking the baby bottle!».

They were in the bloody battles of Merengue and Baladredo, both at the Segre front during the so-called offensive of Catalonia. They also took part in the Battle of the Ebro  and some were assigned to the Alpine battalion, in the Lleida Pyrenees .

After the war, very different fates ran. Some went into exile in France and ended up in the concentration camps of Argelès-Sur-Mer, Saint-Cyprien and Agda . Others, in the Francoist prisons and in the concentration camps of Vitoria and Miranda de Ebro and others went to battalions of workers distributed throughout Spain and did military service in Zaragoza, Barcelona and even in the Spanish Sahara. Another part of the young people was freed by the Franco regime in case of being captured since, as was normal throughout the conflict, most of the ideology of those called up was not reciprocal to the side that forced them to enlist under duress to a large extent. of the cases.

In 1983, some 307 survivors and 412 relatives founded the «Agrupación de Supervivientes de la Leva del Biberón-41».

[[Curlew]]

CATEGORIES: Charadriiformes

The curlew is Numenius, a bird with a long downcurved bill (beak). With its beak the bird probes mudflats for food. 

In pre-modern times the world had many more mudflats than it does today. Many have been eliminated by draining so as to give more land for farming. So, in England, the places suitable for the bird were in river estuaries and low-lying land. Originally, southern England had wide areas of mudflats suitable for the bird.

What changed was the draining of the "levels" to make for better farming. In England areas in East Anglia, Kent and Somerset were all drained and made productive farmland. A similar process happened in many countries. The consequence is that the curlews' numbers have dropped and the bird has become rare in places where it was once common.

Broadly speaking, curlews are waders, as are the godwits which look similar but have straight bills.

Most curlews migrate and so one or more species occur at different times of the year in Europe, Ireland, Britain, Iberia, Iceland, Africa, Southeast Asia, Siberia, North America, South America and Australasia. There are nine species of curlew.

[[Pollinator]]

CATEGORIES: Symbiosis, Insects, Beekeeping, Ecology, Plant physiology

A pollinator is an animal that does pollination. Pollination is almost entirely done by insects, though there are some exceptions. Some birds (such as hummingbirds) pollinate flowers as they take nectar. Overall, however, it is insects that pollinate. Bees, of course, pollinate flowers as they take nectar. But wasps, ants, flies, beetles, butterflies and moths all have many species which are pollinators. The plant which offers the pollen is called the pollenizer.

To be a pollinator, an insect has to move pollen from the male anther to the female stigma of a flower. The pollinator gets away with much of the pollen for its own use.

Although it is obvious that flowering plants are the plants which usually offer pollen, there is a pre-history of pollination in cycads.

Bees may not be the most numerous insects which take up the pollen. Hoverflies (Syrphidae) are very numerous visitors to flowers, and they may be more numerous than bees in many environments.

The list of pollinators is long. Bees, wasps, ants, flies, mosquitoes, lepidoptera and beetles all have some pollinators who take nectar, and also some vertebrates: bats, birds, monkeys, lemurs, possums, rodents.

Wild pollinators often visit many plant species, and plants are visited by many pollinator species. All these relations together form a network of interactions between plants and pollinators. Surprising similarities exist in the networks of interactions between plants and pollinators. This structure is similar in very different ecosystems on different continents, consisting of entirely different species.

Tonaki was born in late October 1884 in Sashiki (today Nanjō), Okinawa, as the second child and only boy of seven siblings, of whom one sister, who was eight years younger, was still living at the time of his death. In mid-1st decade of the 20th century, Tonaki fled to Hawaii to avoid the Russo-Japanese War and worked at a sugar refinery for about ten years before returning to Okinawa, working as a farmer until age 89. He married a woman named Kame (who was eight years younger and died at age 61 during the Battle of Okinawa) and had six children (of whom one died young of liver disease and four, all except his second son, died during the Battle of Okinawa).

Tonaki became the oldest living man in Japan just 40 days before his 107th birthday, on 20 September 1991, after 108-year-old Gihei Oka's death and also the oldest living Japanese man overall, later on 16 February 1992 after the 109 years, 13 days old Russo-Japanese War veteran Mamoru Eto's death, as Eto who was just 4 days younger than Oka emigrated to the United States, and later on 30 October 1994 only the second Japanese man who became a supercentenarian, after Eiju Tsuru who died on 11 January 1990, just 24 days before his 111th birthday, although Shigechiyo Izumi who died on 21 February 1986 was still believed to have been aged 120 years, 237 days and Denzo Ishizaki claimed to have been ten days older than Tonaki, as his birth register which showed a birth year of 1886 rather than 1884 was claimed to have been delayed by two years.

After 111-year-old Frenchman Émile Fourcade's death on 29 December 1995, Tonaki became the last living man born in 1884 as well as the second-oldest living man behind Danish-born Americanman Christian Mortensen, although Americanman Johnson Parks has been verified to have been 15 days older than Tonaki but recently become disputed after a study proving that he may have been born around ten years later than he claimed.

Wolfe started legal proceedings to have voters in the primary in his name allowed.  Eight other delegates who didn't announce who they'd vote for, known as superdelegates, also attended the convention and cast their votes as well.

The Chicago sisters Regina and Margaret DeFrancisco were two teenage girls. The sisters made national headlines for the high-profile murder of Regina's then boyfriend Oscar Velazquez in June 2000.

On June 6, 2000, Regina DeFrancisco called her boyfriend of three weeks, 22-year-old Oscar Velazquez, to her home. The DeFrancisco sisters' friend was at the home. The friend gave Margaret a .38 caliber semi-automatic pistol. Margaret then used the gun to shoot Oscar in the back of his head. Oscar was instantly killed.

After the murder, the DeFrancisco sisters robbed the victim of just over $600. They drove Oscar's body in his 2000 Chevrolet Camaro Z28. That was where the sisters used nail polish remover, then set Oscar's body on fire. A private caller dialed 911 to report the fire. Just after finding Velazquez' body in the fire, he dialed 911 a second time.

The sisters tried to sell the Camaro. They were not successful. Regina and Margaret later abandoned the Camaro and set it on fire. Shortly after, the sisters were questioned by police as suspects in the murder of Oscar Velazquez. The sisters' stories, though, did not match up. Before Margaret and Regina could be arrested for murder, they left the Chicago area and began evading police.

After just under two years evading police, Margaret was captured in Rockford, Illinois on March 24, 2002. An anonymous tip after a showing of America's Most Wanted led to her capture at an apartment complex where she was staying with relatives. Margaret was arrested for and charged with the murder of Oscar Velazquez. She was also charged with unlawful flight to avoid prosecution.

Seven months later on October 18, 2002, Regina was arrested in Dallas, Texas. The Chicago FBI reported that she was taken into custody after a traffic stop and high speed chase.

Regina DeFrancisco was found guilty of murder and armed robbery. She was sentenced to 35 years in prison. Margaret was sentenced to 46 years in prison.

[[Antiphon (music)]]

CATEGORIES: Music, Christianity

In Christian liturgy, an antiphon is the name of a short section, between the cleric, and usually the crowd. These sections are either spoken (the priest asks something, and the crowd gives a predefined answer, also spoken), or they are sung. When they are sung, the often use simple melodies. Antiphons are very old: In the 4th century they were used in what is called Ambrosian chant today.  In liturgy, antiphons are not used on their own: the priest or person of the clergy says or chants these, while performing a ritual. In many pieces of church music, the choir (who replaces the crowd)  starts singing as a response to an antiphon.  

In more modern forms of church music (such as Gospels, but also traditional African music), there's a tradition of call and response. A lead singer calls something, and the choir responds.

CATEGORIES: Evolution, Trees

Plants have a history even longer than animals, because animal life is based on eating plants. Plants evolved before animals. The first plants were cyanobacteria which formed stromatolites. However, this article deals with plants as understood by most people. Their history starts in the Silurian period, about 430 million years ago (mya).

Evidence of the earliest land plants is about 470mya, in Ordovician rocks from Saudi Arabia, and Gondwana.  

In the Devonian of ~370 mya, some spore plants such as Archaeopteris had secondary vascular tissue which produced wood and had formed forests of tall trees. Also by this time Elkinsia, an early seed fern, had evolved seeds.

The order in which tree-like land plants evolved is this:

[[Peer-to-peer file sharing]]

CATEGORIES: Internet, File sharing

Peer-to-peer file sharing is the sharing and distribution of digital media using peer-to-peer networking technology. P2P file sharing allows users to access files, like movies, books, music and games using a P2P software program. 

There is an ongoing discussion related to the economic impact of P2P file sharing. 

The economic effect of copyright infringement under peer-to-peer file sharing on music has been controversial and hard to determine. Some unofficial studies found that file sharing had a negative impact on overall record sales.

The United States' Motion Picture Association of America said that American studios lost just over $2.373 billion to Internet piracy in 2005. That was about one third of the total cost of movie piracy in the United States. The estimate from the MPAA was doubted by commentators. It was based under the assumption that one download was the equivalent of one lost sale. Downloaders might not buy the movie if downloading was an option.

[[Full employment]]

CATEGORIES: Economics

Full employment is an idea from economics. It means that every person that is able and willing to work can get a job. It does not mean that all people have a job: People who do not have the skills the employers want may still not have a job, because there simply is no role that fits them. This is called structural unemployment. Also, it is very likely that there will be people looking for jobs (called frictional unemployment).

In general, people say there is full employment, if the percentage of people who are able and willing to work, but who do not have a job is below a given rate. In 1945, William Henry Beveridge said there was full employment if there are more jobs than job seekers. He said that an unemployment rate of three percent of frictional (short term) unemployment can be considered full employment.

Many rulers performed by themselves the rites of singing it with an accompanying dance on the occasion of their conquests or coronation. According to the manuscript "Laisra Pham", a treatise on administration and social conduct, "Ougri" is refered to as sung at the coronation of Nongta Lailen Pakhangpa in 33 AD.

In some cases, it is also refered to as the actual war songs of the Meitei people.

[[Time crystal]]

CATEGORIES: Quantum mechanics, Time

A time crystal is a quantum system that has repeating periodic oscillations of one or more physical measurements  in its ground state when seen over time.

Just as an ordinary crystal is seen to have its atoms arranged in repeating patterns in space, so a time crystal has a repeating patterns that occur over time.  

In 2012, the American Nobel Prize winner Frank Wilczek proposed the concept of a time crystal.

In 2017 the atomic physicist Chris Monroe and his group found evidence of oscillations in optically excited chains of ytterbium ions with the behavior predicted for time crystals  but not in the same way theorized in 2012.

In terms of practical use, time crystals may one day be used as quantum memories.

[[Educational research]]

CATEGORIES: Education, Research methods

Educational research investigates how people learn. Literacy was the first starting-point. Before about 1470 all books were hand-written. Printing made the word visible. Before 1800 most ordinary people could not read or write. That was true for all countries. By 1900 most people in the most industrial countries could read. The Bible was one of the causes: people wanted to read the Bible in Christian countries. Just as important was industrialization. With industry grew a need for instruction, and there were printed rule books in key industries such as the railways. Church registers in England show increasing literacy as judged by the ability of men to sign their names. Previously, if a man signed with an X, a church clerk added his name.

An enormous amount of research has been done in the United States, and very much less elsewhere

Researching comes in many ways. Researches here focuses more on how people gather new things into their minds. These people could be learners or teachers. Both can interact in spaces of learning. These spaces are also known as classrooms. So researchers collect data inside classrooms, more or less. 

Educational researchers believe that the way they do research must be careful and well-ordered.  First is on the basis of comparison. Second is on principles to set that everyone follows. Third is on how researchers do their research. Also, they borrow concepts from other studies, may it be about minds, society, human beings, and reasoning. The same goes for how they do their research.

[[Jerky]]

CATEGORIES: Snack foods, Meat

Jerky is lean and trimmed meat that has been cut into strips and dried (dehydrated) so it will not spoil. Normally, the drying includes adding salt. It prevents the growth of bacteria before the meat has finished the dehydrating process. The word jerky is from the Quechua word ch'arki. The word means "dried, salted meat".

Store-bought jerky often has sweeteners, like brown sugar.

Jerky is ready-to-eat, does not need to be prepared further and can be stored for months without being chilled.

Most fat must be trimmed from the meat before drying. Fat increases the chance of spoilage. (Modern vacuum packing and preservatives have helped stop these risks.) The meat must be dried quickly during the critical period where the meat is not yet dry.

Lesbian and gay identification and bar culture increased with the migration and passing through of people in big cities during and after World War II. In the 1970s, lesbian feminism began. Bars became important community activist spaces.

[[Wow! signal]]

CATEGORIES: SETI

The Wow! signal was a strong narrowband radio signal received on August 15, 1977, by Ohio State University's Big Ear radio telescope in the United States, which was being used to support the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. The signal appeared to come from the direction of the constellation Sagittarius and met all the expectations of a signal of extraterrestrial origin.

Astronomer Jerry R. Ehman found the signal a few days after it was received while reviewing the data printout. He was so impressed by it that he circled the text that represented the signal on the computer printout, "6EQUJ5", and wrote the comment "Wow!" on its side, leading to the event's widely used name.

The entire signal was detected for the full 72-second window during which Big Ear was able to observe it, but has not been detected since, even though many, such as Ehman, have tried to. Many explanations have been given on where the signal comes from, including natural and human-made sources, but none of them are good enough to explain the signal.

Although the Wow! signal had no detectable changes which would have allowed the signal send information, it remains the strongest candidate for an alien radio transmission ever detected.
