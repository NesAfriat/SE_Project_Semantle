[[Wrought iron]]

CATEGORIES: Iron

Wrought iron is a type of iron. It has very little carbon in it. Most steels have much more carbon. It also has some slag in it. This gives it a fibrous look similar to how wood looks. It is tough, malleable, ductile, and can be welded easily. It was most common in the old days when cast iron was the only other type of iron. Now mild steel is used instead. If it contains too much sulfur, it becomes very brittle when heated. Wrought iron has a rough surface that can hold paint and zinc for galvanization much more easily.

Wrought iron was one of the most common types of iron in the medieval times. Its popularity has declined. It is needed to make historical items look historical.

[[Slag]]

CATEGORIES: Chemicals

Hamilton Othanel Smith (born August 23, 1931) is an American microbiologist and a Nobel prize winner. He was jointly awarded the 1978 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. He is a leader in the field of genomics.

Hamilton Smith was, with Craig Venter, a leader in the Celera corporation's bid to analyse and sell information about the human genome. The basic idea was to find ways to make DNA sequencing cheaper so that everyone could have their DNA analysed. Then the information could be used for medical purposes.

Smith's award was for the discovery of restriction enzymes. These are enzymes that cut DNA at specific places. Such enzymes, found in bacteria and archaea, probably evolved to provide a defense mechanism against invading viruses. Inside a bacterial host, the restriction enzymes selectively cut up foreign DNA. Host DNA is modified so it does not get cut up. Together, these two processes are called the restriction modification system. To cut the DNA, a restriction enzyme makes two cuts, once through each sugar-phosphate backbone (i.e. each strand) of the DNA double helix.

The Federalist Papers were a series of essays about the United States Constitution. In total, there were 85 articles, 77 of them appeared in newspapers between October of 1787 and August 1788. Many talked about how the Constitution would solve America's political problems.  Most of them were published in newspapers in New York and Virginia, states where it was not clear whether or not the Constitution would pass (it did).  Most were written by Alexander Hamilton or James Madison, though a few were written by John Jay.  

One of the most famous of the Papers is Federalist No. 10.  It was written by Madison and says that the Constitution would keep the United States from being run by small groups called "factions". The collection of all papers was also published as a book. 

The papers were published using a false name, Publius. This name was used in reference to Publius Valerius Publicola, a Roman Consul and one of the aristocrats who overthrew the Roman Kingdom in the 5th century BC. 

The papers are often thought of as one of the most important works of American political thought.  Sometimes they are used by Supreme Court justices to try to say what the founders were thinking.

[[Cerebral palsy]]

CATEGORIES: Disability, Neurology

Cerebral palsy (CP) is the name given to a number of motor problems (trouble moving the body).  CP is usually caused by damage done to the brain during early childhood. It is called "cerebral palsy" because the part of the brain that is damaged is the cerebrum. CP cannot be cured. It is treated with therapies. 

CP was first identified by an English surgeon called William Little in 1860.

There are several types of cerebral palsy. The most common type is spastic cerebral palsy. 

Today, 1 in every 400 children in the UK has cerebral palsy.

[[Polychlorinated biphenyl]]

CATEGORIES: Organic compounds

Polychlorinated biphenyls (often shortened to PCBs) are organic chemical compounds that contain chlorine atoms. They were used in industrial chemistry, and to make certain transformers, capacitors, and cooling fluids. The Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants declared them to be among the worst chemical pollutants. Their use has been banned worldwide, since 2001. The mode of action of these substances is similar to that of dioxin. 

Polychlorinated biphenyls were widely used, and they can be found in the atmosphere, the soil, and the bodies of water anywhere on the earth. In the short term, these substances are not very toxic, but they accumulate in the body. They are teratogens, and may cause cancer.

[[Mountain pass]]

CATEGORIES: Mountain passes

In a group of hills or mountains, a pass is a path for crossing a mountain. It is usually a saddle point between two higher areas. Many of the world's mountain ranges have always made travel difficult so passes have been important throughout history in trade, war and migration.

A pass has the general form of a saddle between two mountains. They are often found just above the source of a river, making a sort of "bridge" over to the headwaters of another river. Passes may be very short, with steep slopes to the top of the pass, or valleys of many kilometers.

Roads and railways have been built through passes. Some high and rugged passes may have tunnels dug underneath to let traffic move faster.

The top of a pass is often the only flat ground in the area so it is often a good site for buildings. For countries whose borders lie on a mountain range, the pass is often part of the border. As well as making travel easy between valleys, passes also provide a route between two mountain tops so it is common for tracks to meet at a pass; this often makes them good routes even when travelling between a summit and the valley floor.

Some of the best known passes are Great St. Bernard Pass at 2473 in the Alps, the Khyber Pass at 1027 between Afghanistan and Pakistan, and the Khardong La Pass at 5359 in Jammu and Kashmir, India.

[[Blast furnace]]

CATEGORIES: Ores, Chemical processes

A blast furnace is a special type of furnace for smelting iron from ore. Blast furnaces are very large. They can be up to 60 tall and 15 in diameter. The blast furnace is the biggest chemical reactor. Blast furnaces are also called high ovens.

A blast furnace is usually built with a steel case and bricks made of magnesium oxide or other refractory material inside the case. The hot furnace cannot melt these bricks. The furnace is cooled with water running inside part of the case and bricks.

The process of making iron is simple. Iron ore is basically iron oxide.  Iron is made by removing the oxygen. This leaves crude iron called pig iron. This process of removing oxygen is called smelting. Carbon is used in the reduction process, with the ore heated to a high temperature. Carbon easily takes the oxygen off the ore in high temperatures.

[[Ophthalmosauridae]]

CATEGORIES: Ichthyosaurs

Ophthalmosauridae were a family of Ichthyosaurs which lived from the Middle Jurassic to the Upper Cretaceous period.

Within Ophthalmosauridae there are two lineages, one including Aegirosaurus and Ophthalmosaurus, and the other including Brachypterygius, Caypullisaurus and Platypterygius.

Only three genera survived the end-Jurassic extinction event: Caypullisaurus, Maiaspondylus, and Platypterygius. They did, however, have a worldwide distribution. The last to survive was Platypterygius. This genus became extinct about 30 million years before the end of the Upper Cretaceous period. It happened when there was a deep ocean anoxic event, which wiped out all the animals below pelagic waters. Ichthyosaurs, being reptiles, came to the surface to breath, but the extinction event removed their prey species.

[[Anoxic event]]

CATEGORIES: Extinction events, Ecology, Oceanography

An anoxic event (AE) is an event in which parts of the ocean have become low in oxygen (O2) below the surface levels, or when all the oxygen has gone. They may be called oceanic anoxic events or deep ocean anoxic events.

Major anoxic events have happened, though not for millions of years. The geological record of organic-rich sediment (black shales) shows that they happened in the past. However, only "in rare, extreme cases, did euxinia lead to biotic crises. The hypothesis  is best supported by evidence from the end-Permian mass extinction".

Anoxic events may have caused mass extinctions. These mass extinctions were so characteristic that they have been used by geologists as markers in biostratigraphic dating. Typically, oceanic anoxic events last for under half a million years, before a full recovery.

There are several places on earth today that show the features of anoxic events on a localized level. 'Dead zones' exist off the East Coast of the United States in the Chesapeake Bay, in the Scandinavian strait Kattegat, the Black Sea, in the northern Adriatic and off the coast of Louisiana.

[[Metriacanthosaurus]]

CATEGORIES: Carnosaurs

Metriacanthosaurus is a genus of theropod dinosaur that lived in Europe during the Middle Jurassic period, about 160 million years ago. Its name means "Moderate-spined lizard", because its back vertebrae are taller than other meat-eating dinosaurs such as Allosaurus, but shorter than those of other meat-eating dinosaurs, such as Acrocanthosaurus. Like most theropods, Metriacanthosaurus was a meat-eater. It had three fingers on each hand. Each finger ended in a sharp, hook-like claw that was used to grab prey before giving the killing bite with its jaws. It probably preyed on the large, long-necked sauropods, such as Pelorosaurus, that lived in the same time and place as it. It was originally classified as a megalosaurid, but recent studies show that it belongs to its own family, the Metriacanthosauridae

[[Acrocanthosaurus]]

CATEGORIES: Carnosaurs, Cretaceous dinosaurs

Acrocanthosaurus was a genus of theropod dinosaur that lived in North America during the Lower Cretaceous period. Its name means "high-spined lizard". This refers to the spines on its vertebrae which formed a sail or hump when the animal was alive.

Its classification is uncertain. It was originally classified as a spinosaur, because the spines on its back looked like those of Spinosaurus. However, Acrocanthosaurus is now classified as a carnosaur. Most paleontologists believe that it was a carcharodontosaurid.

Acrocanthosaurus was 39 feet long, almost as large as Tyrannosaurus rex, and weighed about 6 or 7 short tons. It was the largest theropod in North America before the evolution of the tyrannosaurs.

Long, low ridges start at the nasal bones. They run along each side of the snout from the nostril back to the eye, and they continued onto the lacrimal bones. This is a characteristic feature of all allosaurids.

There is a famous trackway in Paluxy, Texas, which shows tracks of what might be an Acrocanthosaurus and its prey. While interesting and plausible, this hypothesis is difficult to prove and there are other explanations.

[[Flood basalt]]

CATEGORIES: Volcanology, Plateaus, Flood basalts

A flood basalt or trap basalt is the result of a giant volcanic eruption or series of eruptions that coats large stretches of land or the ocean floor with basalt lava.

Flood basalts have covered areas as large as a continent in prehistory, creating great plateaus and mountain ranges.  Flood basalts have erupted at various times throughout Earth history. They are clear evidence that the Earth has periods of higher activity rather than being in a uniform steady state.

One explanation for flood basalts is that they are caused by the combination of continental rifting and its associated melting. Then a mantle plume produces vast quantities of a basaltic magma. These have a low viscosity, which is why they 'flood' rather than form taller volcanoes.

Flood basalts start at between 100 and 400 km depth, in the asthenosphere. To get a partial melting as large as that of the traps, expelling huge quantities of lava, it is necessary to have a large heat input. Such melting can take place near a hotspot, resulting in a mixture of magma from the depths of the hotspot with superficial magma produced by a mantle plume.

[[Siberian Traps]]

CATEGORIES: Extinction events, Flood basalts, Volcanic landforms, Volcanoes of Asia, Mountains of Russia, Siberia

The Siberian Traps form a large region of volcanic rock, known as a large igneous province, in the Russian region of Siberia. 

The large eruptions which formed the traps were one of the largest known volcanic events of the last 500 million years of Earth history. They continued for a million years and spanned the Permian-Triassic boundary, about 251 to 250 million years ago. It was the same time as the Permian–Triassic extinction event, which is estimated to have killed 90% of species existing at the time. The eruption of the Siberian Traps is a possible cause of this "Great Dying".

The term "traps" is derived from the Swedish word for stairs (trappa, or sometimes trapp), referring to the step-like hills forming the landscape of the region, which is typical of flood basalts.

[[Quadrilateral]]

CATEGORIES: Polygons

The origin of the word quadrilateral is the two Latin words quadri, a variant of four, and latus, meaning "side".

Quadrilaterals can be either complex, also called crossed (self-intersecting), or simple (not self-intersecting). Simple quadrilaterals are either convex or concave.

All the sides of a quadrilateral are straight, and the interior angles of a quadrilateral add up to 360°.

This is a special case of the n-gon interior angle sum formula: (n − 2) × 180°.

All non-self-crossing quadrilaterals tile the plane, by repeated rotation around the midpoints of their edges.

There are 6 special kinds of quadrilaterals; square, rectangle, rhombus, parallelogram, kite, and trapezoid. Technically, squares, rectangles, and rhombuses are types of parallelograms.

[[Yangchuanosaurus]]

CATEGORIES: Carnosaurs, Jurassic dinosaurs

Yangchuanosaurus was a genus of theropod dinosaur from the Jurassic of China. It was a fairly typical carnosaur, with a large head, sharp, serrated teeth, and relatively short arms (though not as short as those of Tyrannosaurus). It was the largest predator in its part of the world. Yangchuanosaurus probably preyed on sauropods, such as Mamenchisaurus, or stegosaurs, such as Tuojiangosaurus.

There are two species. Y. zigongensis is from the Middle Jurassic, and Y. shangyouensis is from the Upper Jurassic. Specimens were collected from the Dashanpu Dinosaur Quarry of Zigong, Sichuan.

The Middle Jurassic Y. zigongensis is known from four incomplete specimens. There are two specimens of the Upper Jurassic Y. shangyouensis, which were at first put into separate species. Later analysis showed they were probably different ages or variations of the same species.

The first skull is 82 cm (2.7 ft) long, and its total body length about 8 m (26 ft). The other specimen was even larger. It had a skull length of 1.11 m (3.6 ft). It may have been up to 10.8 m (35.4 ft) long, and weighed as much as 3.4 metric tons (3.7 short tons). There was a bony knob on its nose and multiple hornlets and ridges, similar to Ceratosaurus. It had a massive tail that was about half its length.

[[Pelorosaurus]]

CATEGORIES: Brachiosaurs

Pelorosaurus conybeari is the name given to a few sauropod dinosaur bones from the Lower Cretaceous period, about 138–112 million years ago. 

Bones of Pelorosaurus have been found in England and Portugal. It was a Brachiosaur, with front legs that were longer than its hind legs. 

The name has been challenged, and has been the subject of long-lasting dispute. Some palaeontologists prefer the name Cetiosaurus brevis.

The taxonomic status of Pelorosaurus is as a result very problematic. Technically, Cetiosaurus brevis is its type species. The position of Pelorosaurus is further undermined by the fact that several researchers hold that the genus is a nomen dubium ('doubtful name').

Pelorosaurus was one of the first dinosaurs described, and the naming procedures were not so well-developed at the time. Its life-style is assumed to be similar to other brachiosaurs, eating from the higher branches of tall conifer trees.

[[Homology]]

CATEGORIES: Biology

A homologous trait is any characteristic which is derived by evolution from a common ancestor. This is contrasted to analogous traits: similarities between organisms that were evolved separately. 

The term existed before 1859, but got its modern meaning after Darwin established the idea of common descent.p45

The pre-Darwinian naturalists Cuvier, Geoffroy and Richard Owen, also used the idea.

A homologous trait is often called a homologue (also spelled homolog). In genetics, the term "homologue" is used both to refer to a homologous protein, and to the gene (DNA sequence) encoding it.

[[Charonosaurus]]

CATEGORIES: Hadrosauridae, Cretaceous dinosaurs

Charonosaurus was a genus of hadrosaur that lived at the very end of the Upper Cretaceous, about 65 million years ago. Its remains were found in China. 

The partial skull resembles that of Parasaurolophus from North America. This does not suggest a Bering land bridge existed during the Cretaceous period, since at that time North America was far away from Eastern Asia. Instead, it is likely that this group of hadrosaurs all had a similar long, backward-projecting hollow crest. It may have been used for trumpeting their calls. In other words, their skull shape was a basal feature.

Charonosaurus was a very large lambeosaurine hadrosaur (estimated around 13 m (42.5 ft) long), known from a partial skull found in Heilongjiang Province, northeastern China. Adult and juvenile hadrosaur remains were found in the same area. They give information on the rest of the skeleton; the femur length was up to 1.35 m. (4.5 ft).

[[Electrical resistivity]]

CATEGORIES: Electricity

Electrical resistivity is a concept in electrical engineering. It is a measure of how much a material stops the flow of electric current through it. Most metals have very low electrical resistivity.

More precisely, "the resistivity of a material of conductor is the resistance of its unit area of cross section and per unit of its length" The International System of Units uses the ohm metre for measuring how much electrical resistivity there is. Electrical resistivity is the inverse of electrical conductivity. This term is more used for semiconductors and insulators.

The resistivity of a substance is equal to the resistance of a rod of that substance which is 1 metre long and 1 square metre in cross-section.  This can be a 1 cubic Metre cube.  So we can also say that the resistivity of a substance is equal to he resistance between the opposite faces of a 1 metre cube of the substance.  The resistivity of a substance does not depend on its length or thickness.  It depends on the nature of the substance and temperature.science-stub

[[Lay clerk]]

CATEGORIES: Singers, Christian religious occupations

A lay clerk, also known as a lay vicar, is a term used in the United Kingdom to describe a male singer who sings in a cathedral choir or a choir belonging to a college of one of the large traditional universities.  A lay clerk is usually paid for the job.  When he is called "lay vicar" the term "vicar" comes from the Latin word "vice" (meaning "deputy").  A lay vicar is not in holy orders (he is not a priest).  Today there are a few female lay clerks, e.g. in Dublin.

The term "layman" was used in the Middle Ages for a chorister who sings some of the music that was too difficult for the priests to sing.  Today many of the lay clerks in places such as Oxford or Cambridge combine their work as layclerk with studying at University.  It is similar to a scholarship for studying.

Sir Richard Owen KCB (Lancaster, 20 July 1804–18 December 1892) was an English biologist, comparative anatomist and palaeontologist.

Owen is probably best remembered today for coining the word Dinosauria (meaning 'Terrible Reptile'), and for his outspoken opposition to Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection.

Owen was the driving force behind the establishment, in 1881, of the British Museum (Natural History) in London.

Owen's technical descriptions of vertebrates were important. His Comparative Anatomy and Physiology of Vertebrates (3 vols. London 1866–1868) was a standard reference work for many years.

His career was tainted by accusations that he failed to give credit to the work of others and even tried to appropriate it under his own name.

[[Adasaurus]]

CATEGORIES: Dromaeosauridae, Cretaceous dinosaurs

Adasaurus is a Dromaeosaur theropod dinosaur from the Upper Cretaceous. It lived in what is now Central Asia. It was a small carnivore, with a large, sickle-shaped claw on the second toe of each hind foot. An adult was probably about 6.2 feet (2 meters) long.

Two specimens of Adasaurus have been found, both from the Gobi Desert of southern Mongolia. One is an incomplete skeleton with partial skull, including the vertebral column except the back of the tail, all three bones of the pelvis, the shoulder girdle and the hindlimbs. The second specimen includes the back end of another skeleton, including the hindlimbs. Both specimens are in the collection of the Mongolian Geological Institute in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia.

The age of the strata, like most of Mongolia's later Cretaceous sediments, is not known for certain. It is thought to be somewhere between 74 and 65 million years ago. Other dinosaurs found in this formation include Tarbosaurus, Anserimimus, and Saurolophus.

[[French ban on face covering]]

CATEGORIES: Politics of France, Islamic dress, Legislation, Islamophobia

On 14 September 2010, the Senate of France (fr) passed a law that forbids the wearing of clothing that covers the face of a person in public, so that the person cannot be identified. The law talks about clothing that covers the face, so it includes burqas and niqabs, but does not include the chador. 

The main arguments for the ban are that people wearing such types of clothing cannot be identified by police forces, and that such veils are not compatible with the values of France as a state. In addition, there was a discussion about women's rights. President Nicolas Sarkozy said that a reason for the ban is to protect women from being forced to cover their faces.

The bill which was introduced, was protested by some women as a violation of women's rights. But many people in France supported the bill, and it was passed in the Senate and the National Assembly of the French Parliament, and it became law.

[[Collective names of groups of like elements]]

CATEGORIES: Chemical nomenclature

There are areas on the periodic table where elements have similar properties. Such areas include Groups, especially columns. 

For example, all of the first column elements (alkali metals) are light, very soft, react with water rapidly, make hydroxides that are strong bases, and react with the halogens to make colorless ionic compounds. 

The second column elements (alkaline earth metals) are a little heavier, a little harder, react with water a little less rapidly, made hydroxides that are strong bases, and react with the halogens to make colorless ionic compounds.

The other categories are: transition metals, pnictogens, chalcogens, halogens, and noble gases. There are also inner transition metals that are divided into lanthanides and actinides.

[[Flamsteed designation]]

CATEGORIES: Astronomical catalogues

Flamsteed designations are for stars that are similar to Bayer designations. However, they use numbers instead of Greek letters. Flamsteed designation contained 2554 stars.

The numbers are usually assigned in the order of increasing right ascension within each constellation. However, because of the effects of precession, they are now slightly out of order in some parts. This method first appeared in  John Flamsteed's Historia Coelestis Britannica, a book that was published by Edmond Halley and Isaac Newton together in 1712.

[[Inner transition metal]]

CATEGORIES: Chemical elements, Periodic table

Inner transition metals (ITM) are chemical elements on the periodic table. They are normally shown in two rows below all the other elements. They include elements 57-71, or lanthanides, and 89-103, or actinides. The lanthanides are very similar, and the actinides are all radioactive. 

ITMs have three incomplete outermost nucelus shells and are all metals. In some cases they are quite malleable and ductile. Many lanthanides such as Lutetium are used in the lighting industry. Actinides don't occur in nature (except for thorium and uranium), and are highly unstable. 

These elements belong to f-block and are known as the anti-penultimate shell.

Its general configuration is (n-2)f^0-14(n-1)d^0-2np^6ns^2 where n= 6-7.

[[Molar mass]]

CATEGORIES: Periodic table

Molar mass is the mass of a substance that has 6.022 × 1023 atoms (Avogadro's number). The mass number of an element is equal to the molar mass of the element . The molar mass of a chemical compound is the mass when the compound has 6.022 × 1023 molecules. Molar mass of Chlorine is 35.45 due to consideration of avg molar mass by including mass of its all isotopes.

It can be found by adding the molar masses of all of its elements. Sodium hydroxide's (NaOH) molar mass can be found by adding the molar mass of sodium, oxygen, and hydrogen, which would be 39.997 g/mo

[[Absolute hot]]

CATEGORIES: Physics, Temperature

It is the opposite of Absolute zero which is -273.15°C on the Celsius scale or 0 K on the Kelvin scale. When something reaches this temperature, normal physics completely changes.

[[D-block]]

CATEGORIES: Periodic table

The D-block is a group of elements on the periodic table. They include the transition metals. The Group 12 elements are normally called post-transition metals because they are different from the transition metals. The Group 12 elements are still in the d-block though. The d-block can hold up to ten (10) electrons at most.

[[Group 12 element]]

CATEGORIES: Periodic table

A group 12 element is a group in the periodic table of chemical elements. It includes zinc, cadmium, mercury, and copernicium. Copernicium is not stable so its properties are not clear. They all have low melting and boiling points. Mercury is even a liquid. Zinc is the least electronegative and most reactive of the Group 12 elements.

[[Period 4 element]]

CATEGORIES: Periodic table

A period 4 element is an element in the fourth period (row) of the periodic table. It begins at potassium and ends at krypton. Period 4 has 18 elements.

Period 4 elements have electrons in the first four electron shells. All period 4 elements have one or more electrons in the fourth electron shell (valence electrons). When atomic number increases by one, another electron is added. Two electrons join the 4s orbital, ten electrons join the 3d orbital, and six electrons join the 4p orbitals.

[[Kilojoule per mole]]

CATEGORIES: Physics, Units of measurement

A kilojoule per mole is a way of measuring the amount of heat needed for something. It is the number of kilojoules needed to make the reaction in one mole of substance.

[[Enthalpy of fusion]]

CATEGORIES: Physics

Enthalpy of fusion is the measure of the energy needed to change a substance from a solid to a liquid. Extra energy is needed, more than what is obvious by the temperature scale. For example, ice at 0°C needs to absorb heat before it converts (changes) to water at 0°C. The temperature does not change, but energy is absorbed to change from solid to liquid.

[[Ionization energy]]

CATEGORIES: Chemistry

Ionization energy is the energy needed to remove the most loosely attached electron from an atom. The atom is not connected to any other atoms. The chemical elements to the left of the periodic table have a much lower ionization energy. The ones to the right have a much higher ionization energy. The chemical elements down the periodic table have a much lower ionization energy (due to electrons being farther away from the atom with increasing atomic radius). The ionization energy increases as each electron is removed.

Ionization energies are dependent upon the atomic radius. Since going from right to left on the periodic table, the atomic radius increases, and the ionization energy increases from left to right in the periods and up the groups. Exceptions to this trend is observed for alkaline earth metals (group 2) and nitrogen group elements (group 15). Typically, group 2 elements have ionization energy greater than group 13 elements and group 15 elements have greater ionization energy than group 16 elements. Groups 2 and 15 have completely and half-filled electronic configuration respectively, thus, it requires more energy to remove an electron from completely filled orbitals than incompletely filled orbitals.

Alkali metals (IA group) have small ionization energies, especially when compared to halogens or VII A group. In addition to the radius (distance between nucleus and the electrons in outermost orbital), the number of electrons between the nucleus and the electron(s) you're looking at in the outermost shell have an effect on the ionization energy as well. This effect, where the full positive charge of the nucleus is not felt by outer electrons due to the negative charges of inner electrons partially canceling out the positive charge, is called shielding. The more electrons shielding the outer electron shell from the nucleus, the less energy required to expel an electron from said atom. The higher the shielding effect the lower the ionization energy. It is because of the shielding effect that the ionization energy decreases from top to bottom within a group. From this trend, Cesium is said to have the lowest ionization energy and Fluorine is said to have the highest ionization energy (with the exception of Helium and Neon).

[[Picometer]]

CATEGORIES: Units of length

A picometer is a measurement. It is one millionth of a billionth of a meter. It is also one trillionth of a millimeter. This is very small. Many atoms are larger than this.

CATEGORIES: Chemistry, Chemical bonding, Physics

The Van der Waals radius is the radius of an atom that is seen as a hard sphere. It is named after someone who realized that atoms were not points, but actual objects. It can be found by the critical point and the physical properties of a gas. It also can be found by a molecular crystal. 

[[Diamagnetism]]

CATEGORIES: Magnetism

Diamagnetism is a type of magnetism. They very weakly repel magnets. Most substances are diamagnetic. It was discovered in 1778 when someone saw that bismuth and antimony repelled a magnet. Diamagnetic things can be levitated. A frog was levitated in a very strong magnet. Water can be repelled by a magnet because it is diamagnetic. It is too weak to be noticed normally, though.

[[Young's modulus]]

CATEGORIES: Physics

Young's modulus is the measure of how much force is needed to stretch or compress a substance. Its most basic form is stress/strain. Stress is the measure of the force applied to a certain area. Strain is the amount by which the substance is deformed.

[[Shear modulus]]

CATEGORIES: Physics

Shear modulus is a measure of the amount of force that will shear or twist an object. It is normally the letter G. It is the measure of the force needed to shear an object that is attached to a solid object. It can also measure the amount of force needed to twist an object.

[[Bulk modulus]]

CATEGORIES: Physics

The bulk modulus (letter K) is a measure of the resistance of a substance to compression on all sides. Gases are easily compressed, while solids and liquid are only compressed with difficulty. It is measured by a measuring instrument when another object is placed under pressure. Its unit is psi.

[[Poisson's ratio]]

CATEGORIES: Physics

Poisson's ratio (letter v) is a measure of the contraction that happens when an object is stretched. It is named after Siméon Denis Poisson. This contraction is perpendicular to the stretching force. It can also expand as the object is compressed in a perpendicular direction.

For example, if a block is being stretched as shown in the image to the right, the equation for the poisson's ratio will be: 

Poisson's ratio ranges from 0.0-0.5 for common materials, though for materials with certain structures, can be as low as -1. A material with a Poisson's ratio close to 0 (like cork) can be stretched a lot in the axial direction without changing much at all in the transverse, where as pulling on a material with a high Poisson's ratio (like rubber) will cause it to become much more narrow. A material with a negative Poisson's ratio will expand in all directions as it is stretched.

[[Brinell scale]]

CATEGORIES: Tests, Physics

The Brinell scale is a measure of hardness in materials.  It is measured by making a dent in the material and seeing how deep the dent goes with a known amount of force. It is similar to the Mohs' hardness scale, which scratches the material. It is used to test the hardness of metals. Normally, a steel ball is pressed into an object and the dent made is measured.

[[CAS registry number]]

CATEGORIES: Chemical nomenclature, Numbers

A CAS registry number is a unique number given to every chemical substance by the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS). It is also called  CASRN or CAS number. CAS registry number is also given to organic, inorganic compounds, minerals, isotopes, alloys. They are numbers ending with a check digit. They do not contain any structure information of the chemical.

It now identifies more than 164 million organic and inorganic substances. 68 million protein and DNA sequences are identified also. It is updated with around 15,000 new substances everyday.

Usually once a year, the board of directors invite shareholders to a meeting to talk about the company.

[[Clinical thermometer]]

CATEGORIES: Temperature, Medical equipment, Thermometers

A clinical thermometer is a thermometer used to measure human body temperature. Most made in the 20th century are mercury-in-glass thermometers. They are accurate and sensitive, having a narrow place where the mercury level rises very fast. A kink in the tube stops the mercury level from falling on its own.

These thermometers are used in clinics by doctors,  it is a clinical thermometers they are also called a doctor's thermometers or medical thermometers.  Most show both Celsius scale and Fahrenheit temperature scales, and run from 35 degree Celsius to 42 degree Celsius. 

Medical thermometers are cleaned before and after each use, with alcohol.

For centuries medical thermometers were large, and took many minutes to register a temperature.  In the 1860s smaller, better ones were made, and thus thermometers were more often used.  An ear thermometer was invented in the 1960s, which works quickly and easily.  Digital thermometers became widespread in the late 20th century.

The Sugar Act (1764) was a tax passed by the British to pay for the Seven Years War, called the French and Indian War in America. 

It taxed sugar and decreased taxes on molasses in British colonies in America and the West Indies. This restricted smuggling. It was also a use of mercantilism. It was one of the first taxes that led to protests in the Thirteen Colonies. The Sugar and Stamp Acts were done away with in 1766.

[[Townshend Duties]]

CATEGORIES: 18th century in the United States, Taxation

The Townshend Duties, formally known as the Townshend Acts, was a tax passed by the British. It was named for Charles Townshend, who was the British Prime Minister at the time. He spearheaded the acts, but he died before the detrimental effects were clear. In 1776, he was hanged in effigy, which means a doll was made to represent him and it was hanged in the town square in Boston. It taxed all imported goods. E.g tea, food, anything that was imported. Townshend wanted the duties to make sure the colonists knew that they were under British rule. The acts were resisted in the Thirteen Colonies.

[[Tea Act]]

CATEGORIES: Legislation, Kingdom of Great Britain

Tea Act of 1773 was a law made by the Parliament of Great Britain. The law was made to help the East India Company which had massive amounts of tea stored in London which they could not sell. The law would make the company's tea cheaper than other tea which was being smuggled into Britain's North American colonies.  This was supposed to make people buy East India Company tea on which the Townshend duties were paid, thus implicitly agreeing to accept Parliament's right of taxation.

The law gave the Company the right to directly ship its tea to North America and the right to the duty-free export of tea from Britain. The tax imposed by the Townshend Acts and collected in the colonies remained in force. It became law on May 10, 1773.

The Jay Treaty was a treaty between the United States and Britain in the years following the American Revolution. The main American involved in the treaty was John Jay, who was also Chief Justice of the United States. It was passed by the United States Congress in 1795. It allowed for increased trade with Britain in exchange for the British giving up their forts on the Great Lakes.  The Democratic-Republican Party thought that the Jay Treaty was good for the British and bad for the Americans, which led to them burning effigies of Jay.

[[Aegyptosaurus]]

CATEGORIES: Dinosaurs of Africa, Cretaceous dinosaurs, Titanosaurs

Aegyptosaurus, meaning "Egypt's Lizard", is a genus of sauropod dinosaur that lived in Africa around 95 million years ago during the Upper Cretaceous period. Like most sauropods, it had a long neck and a small skull. The animal's long tail probably acted as a counterweight to its body mass. Its tail also ended in a whip-like structure that it used to defend itself against predatory dinosaurs such as Carcharodontosaurus and Spinosaurus. 

Aegyptosaurus was a close relative of Argentinosaurus, a much larger dinosaur that lived in South America at about the same time. This suggests a possible land bridge between Africa and South America during the Cretaceous period. 

Aegyptosaurus was discovered and named by a German paleontologist named Ernst Stromer in 1932. Its fossils were found in Egypt, Niger, and in several different locations in the Sahara Desert. All known specimens were discovered before 1939. The fossils were stored together in Munich, but were destroyed when an Allied bombing raid hit the museum in 1944, during World War II.

The type species is Aegyptosaurus baharijensis, named after the Bahariya Formation in Egypt, where the first fossils were found.

Aegyptosaurus was much smaller and more common than its contemporary, Paralititan.

Thomas Gainsborough (14 May 1727 – 2 August 1788) was an 18th-century English portrait and landscape painter. He was born in Sudbury, Suffolk, England. He was the youngest son of John Gainsborough. When he was 13, he surprised his father by how well he drew with the pencil. Impressed, his father let him go to London to study art in 1740. In the 1740s, Gainsborough married Margaret Burr and began painting portraits more than landscapes. He had two daughters. In 1774, Gainsborough and his family moved to London. In 1780, he painted portraits of King George III. He died of cancer in London on 2 August 1788 at age 61 years.

In painting portraits he sometimes painted with brushes on sticks six feet long. This put him at the same distance from subject and canvas, set at right angles to each other.

[[Colonial Clash]]

The Colonial Clash is an annual American College Football rivalry game played between the University of Massachusetts and the University of New Hampshire. These are traditionally the two best programs in the championship subdivision of college football in New England.

The rivalry adopted the name "Colonial Clash" on August 18, 2010, just two months before becoming the first college football match-up ever at Gillette Stadium. Robert Kraft, owner of Gillette Stadium and its tenants, the New England Patriots and New England Revolution, called it "a fitting name for a border rivalry between schools who represent two of the original colonies." The game is scheduled to be held at the professional venue in both 2010 and 2011.

The two schools have played each other every year since 1952, with UMass holding a 43-26-3 advantage. UNH captured the 2008 game 52-21 while UMass won on homecoming in 2009, 23-17. In 2006, the schools played twice, meeting first on November 4th in Durham, NH (with UMass winning 28-20), then again on December 2nd in Amherst for the NCAA FCS Quarterfinals (UMass winning 24-17). After each regular season meeting, the Billy Knight Trophy is awarded to the MVP of the game.

Since the separation of Division I college football into two separate tiers in 1978, UMass has played for the National Championship three times (1978, 1999, 2006), winning in 1999. While New Hampshire has not yet reached a National Championship game, they were the #1 overall seed in the 2005 FCS playoffs.

[[Classical physics]]

CATEGORIES: Physics

Classical physics are the physics that were made before the 20th century. This part of physics studies things like movement, light, gravity, and electricity. 

Most of physics today uses ideas that are more complicated than the ideas of classical physics, because in the 20th century, physicists discovered two better ways to describe nature: the theory of relativity and quantum mechanics. 

Classical physics turned out not to work when the things being studied were very, very small (around the size of atoms or smaller), or were moving very, very fast (around the speed of light). So, around the beginning of the twentieth century, Albert Einstein worked out his Theory of Relativity and people like Neils Bohr, Werner Heisenberg. and Erwin Schrödinger created quantum mechanics. 

[[Huayangosaurus]]

CATEGORIES: Jurassic dinosaurs, Stegosaurs

Huayangosaurus is a genus of stegosaurian dinosaur from the Middle Jurassic of China. The name derives from "Huayang", an alternate name for Sichuan province. 

It lived about 165 million years ago, some 20 million years before its famous relative, Stegosaurus appeared in North America. At only 4.5 metres long, it was also much smaller than its famous cousin. Found in the Lower Shaximiao Formation, Huayangosaurus shared the local landscape with the sauropods Shunosaurus, Datousaurus, Omeisaurus and Protognathosaurus, the ornithopod Xiaosaurus and the carnivorous Gasosaurus.

[[Gas balloon]]

CATEGORIES: Aircraft

A gas balloon is a kind of balloon that uses a gas of low density to fly using buoyancy.  Gas balloons sometimes fly very high, very far, and for a very long time.

A gas balloon is different from a hot air balloon.  A hot air balloon uses a fire to lower

the density of air.  A gas balloon does not use fire.

The most common use for gas balloons are to measure the atmosphere.  These are called weather balloons.

Some gas balloons carry people.

[[Art Nouveau]]

CATEGORIES: Art movements, Architectural styles

Art Nouveau  is an international art movement and style based on organic forms. It was seen in modern art, graphic design, architecture and applied arts such as decoration, jewellery, ceramics and glass.p7 It peaked in popularity at the fin de siècle of the late 19th century (1890–1905), and continued until the First World War.

A reaction to academic art of the 19th century, Art Nouveau is organic in style. It has floral and plant-inspired motifs, and stylized, flowing curvilinear forms.p3-36 Art Nouveau is an approach to design according to which artists should work on everything from architecture to furniture, making art part of everyday life.

The movement was strongly influenced by Czech artist Alphonse Mucha. Mucha produced a lithographed poster as an advertisement for the play Gismonda by Victorien Sardou, starring Sarah Bernhardt. The poster appeared on 1 January 1895 in the streets of Paris. It was an overnight sensation, and announced the new artistic style and its creator to the citizens of Paris. Initially called the Style Mucha, this soon became known as Art Nouveau.

Art Nouveau's fifteen-year life was most strongly felt throughout Europe—from Glasgow to Moscow to Madrid—but its influence was global. In France, Hector Guimard's Paris Metro entrances shaped the landscape of Paris and Emile Gallé was at the center of the school of thought in Nancy. Victor Horta had a decisive impact on architecture in Belgium.p37

Magazines like Jugend helped spread the style in Germany, especially as a graphic design form, while the Vienna Secessionists influenced art and architecture throughout Austria-Hungary. Art Nouveau was also a movement of distinct individuals such as Gustav Klimt, Charles Rennie Mackintosh, Alphonse Mucha, René Lalique, Antoni Gaudí and Louis Comfort Tiffany, each of whom interpreted it in their own individual manner.p34

Although Art Nouveau fell out of favour with the arrival of 20th-century modernist styles, it is seen today as an important bridge between Neoclassicism and modernism.

Art Nouveau monuments are now recognized by UNESCO on their World Heritage Sites list as significant contributions to cultural heritage. The historic center of Riga, Latvia, with "the finest collection of art nouveau buildings in Europe", was inscribed on the list in 1997 in part because of the "quality and the quantity of its Art Nouveau/Jugendstil architecture". Four Brussels town houses by Victor Horta were included in 2000 as "works of human creative genius" that are "outstanding examples of Art Nouveau architecture brilliantly illustrating the transition from the 19th to the 20th century in art, thought, and society".

[[Wheat flour]]

CATEGORIES: Flour, Wheat

Wheat flour is a type of flour made from wheat kernels. There are two main types of wheat flour: whole wheat flour and white flour. Whole wheat flour has the whole grain of wheat, making it more nutritious. White flour only has the endosperm of the wheat grain, making it less nutritious. White flour is preferred by many people. White flours are normally enriched. Wheat flour can be sifted to make it finer and smoother.

[[Dysgraphia]]

CATEGORIES: Disability

Dysgraphia or agraphia is the learning disability to write texts, even though the person has the necessary motoric skills. People with dysgraphia can move their hand enough, and are also capable of understanding how to write. Dysgraphias  occur because of damage done to the brain. They often occur with other illnesses, such as speech problems. Many people who suffered a stroke may have lost the ability to move parts of their body. There are different forms of dysgraphia:

[[List of African dinosaurs]]

CATEGORIES: Dinosaurs of Africa, Lists of Dinosaurs

This is a list of dinosaurs whose remains have been recovered from Africa. 

Africa has a rich fossil record, but it is patchy and incomplete. Prosauropods dating from the late Triassic period, about 230 million years ago, have been discovered in Madagascar. 

Africa is rich in Triassic and Lower Jurassic dinosaurs. African dinosaurs from these time periods include Syntarsus, Dracovenator, Melanorosaurus, Massospondylus, Euskelosaurus, Heterodontosaurus, Abrictosaurus, and Lesothosaurus. The Middle Jurassic is poorly represented in Africa. Only the three sauropods Cetiosaurus, Lapparentosaurus, and Archaeodontosaurus  have been discovered dating from this time period. 

The Upper Jurassic, however, is well represented in Africa, mainly thanks to the spectacular Tendaguru Formation, a Lagerstätte in southeastern Tanzania. Allosaurus, Ceratosaurus, Elaphrosaurus, Giraffatitan, Dicraeosaurus, Janenschia, Tornieria, Tendaguria, Kentrosaurus, and Dryosaurus are among the dinosaurs whose remains have been recovered from Tendaguru. This fauna seems to show strong similarities to that of the Morrison Formation in the United States and the Lourinha Formation in Portugal. For example, Allosaurus, Ceratosaurus, and Dryosaurus have been found in both the Tendaguru and the Morrison. This has important biogeographical implications. This means the animals could travel between most continents at that time (Pangaea).

The Lower Cretaceous in Africa is known primarily from the northern part of the continent, particularly Niger. 

Suchomimus, Elrhazosaurus, Spinostropheus, Rebbachisaurus, Nigersaurus,  Kryptops, Nqwebasaurus, and Paranthodon are some of the early Cretaceous dinosaurs known from Africa. The early Cretaceous was an important time for the dinosaurs of Africa because it was when Africa finally separated from South America, forming the South Atlantic Ocean. This was an important event because now the dinosaurs of Africa started developing endemism because of isolation.

The Upper Cretaceous of Africa is known mainly from North Africa. During the early part of the Upper Cretaceous, North Africa was home to a rich dinosaur fauna. It includes Spinosaurus, Carcharodontosaurus, Rugops, Bahariasaurus, Deltadromeus, Paralititan, Aegyptosaurus, and Ouranosaurus. During the latest Cretaceous, at the end of the Age of Dinosaurs, Majungasaurus, Masiakasaurus, Rapetosaurus, and the flying dromaeosaurid Rahonavis lived in Africa.

[[Second Great Awakening]]

CATEGORIES: 19th century in the United States, Christianity in the United States

The Second Great Awakening was a Protestant religious movement in the United States.(important) The Second Great Awakening, which spread religion through revival meetings and emotional preaching, sparked a number of reform movements. 

It was led by people such as Charles Grandison Finney, Henry Ward Beecher, Lyman Beecher, Edward Everett and Joseph Smith. It started in upstate New York in the 1790s, but spread to New England and the Midwest.  During the Second Great Awakening, thousands of people gathered at large religious meetings called revivals.  The people of the Second Great Awakening thought they could bring about a Golden Age in America through religion.  The Second Great Awakening led to new religious movements such as the Holiness Movement and the Mormons, and helped groups like the Methodist Church grow.  

The Second Great Awakening led to two movements in reform, that is, changing laws and behaviors to make society better.  One of these was the Temperance Movement, which believed that drinking alcohol was not good for society.  The other was abolitionism, which wanted to end slavery. People such as Harriet Beecher Stowe and William Lloyd Garrison wrote books and newspapers about how slavery should stop. They formed political movements, including the Liberty Party, the Free Soil Party and the Republican Party (United States).

[[Fauvism]]

CATEGORIES: Art movements

Les Fauves (French for The Wild Beasts) was the name of a modern art movement in the early 20th century, led by the painters Henri Matisse and André Derain. The Fauves were a group of French painters who were influenced by the bright colours used by the Post-Impressionists Vincent van Gogh and Paul Gauguin.

The bright colourful style of painting that they used began around 1900 and continued beyond 1910, but the group was only together for three years, 1905–1907. In that time they had three exhibitions together. Their influence has continued  until the present day, and was adopted or influenced many artists who are not usually thought of as fauvists. Aristarkh Lentulov is one good example.

CATEGORIES: Ankylosauria

Nodosaurus (meaning "knobbed lizard") was a large, armored, quadrupedal (it walked on four legs), tank-like dinosaur. It lived in the first part of the Upper Cretaceous about 113–98 million years ago. Three very incomplete Nodosaurus fossils have been found in Wyoming and Kansas; no skulls have been found yet. It was named by paleontologist Othniel C. Marsh in 1889.

Nodosaurus was about 13 to 20 ft (4-6 m) long. It was an ornithischian (bird-hipped) dinosaur with bony dermal plates covering the top of its body. It had four short legs, five-toed feet, a short neck, and a long, clubless tail. The nodosaurids had no tail club; it is not known how they defended themselves.

[[Patriot Act]]

CATEGORIES: United States federal legislation

The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001, also known as the USA Patriot Act is an anti-terrorism law. It was proposed by the Bush Administration soon after the September 11 attacks.  At that time, President Bush had very high approval ratings and it was clear that most Americans wanted him to do something to stop more terrorism.  The bill passed quickly in Congress, mostly before it had even been fully read.  The act made it much easier to control money terrorists had in bank accounts.  It also made it easier for the government to access people's library and phone records.  The act was criticized by many organizations, particularly the American Civil Liberties Union, for being a threat to Americans' civil liberties and rights.

Sir Jacob Epstein KBE (10 November 1880 – 19 August 1959) was an American-born British sculptor, a pioneer of modern sculpture. He was born in the United States, and moved to Europe in 1902, becoming a British citizen in 1911. He often produced controversial works which challenged taboos on what was appropriate subject matter. His portrait heads were traditional, but much of his other work was modernist. He also made paintings and drawings, and often exhibited his work.

The sculptures Ecce Homo (Old Coventry Cathedral) and Rock Drill (1913–1914, Museum of Modern Art, New York City), are famous and important, but we have no images of them. On view in the Strand, London near Trafalgar Square, are his sculptures for Zimbabwe House. There are a number of his busts (sculptures of heads) in the National Portrait Gallery, also near Trafalgar Square.

[[Galvanizing]]

CATEGORIES: Physical chemistry, Metallurgy

Galvanizing is the coating of a metal with a more reactive metal to stop corrosion. Normally zinc is used to coat iron. The zinc coating corrodes instead of the iron, stopping the iron from corroding. Even if the zinc is scratched, it does not corrode. Metal corrodes after the paint is scratched. The zinc eventually corrodes all the way and then the iron starts corroding.

Galvanizing can happen in two ways. There is hot dip galvanising, where the object is dipped in a pool of liquid zinc. This makes a thicker coating that lasts a long time. It does not have a shiny clean surface, though, so some people would not like it as much.

There is also electro-galvanizing. This is the electroplating of zinc onto an object. It is shiny but thinner, so it does not last as long.

 Henry Spencer Moore OM CH FBA (30 July 1898 – 31 August 1986) was an English sculptor and artist in the modern art genre. He was best known for his abstract monumental sculptures, which are public works of art in many places around the world.

His forms are usually abstractions of the human figure, typically mother-and-child or reclining figures. Moore's works usually suggest the female body, apart from a phase in the 1950s when he did family groups. His forms are generally pierced or have hollow spaces. Some think the undulating form of his reclining figures reflect the landscape and hills of his birthplace, Yorkshire.

Moore was born in Castleford, the son of a mining engineer. He became known for his larger-scale abstract cast bronze and carved marble sculptures. His large-scale commissions made him exceptionally rich. Yet he lived carefully and most of the money he earned went towards endowing the Henry Moore Foundation. This supports education and promotion of the arts.

He did some work in architecture. in 1955 Moore did his only work in carved brick, "Wall Relief" at the Bouwcentrum in Rotterdam. The brick relief was sculpted with 16,000 bricks by two Dutch bricklayers under Moore's supervision.

[[Flotation]]

CATEGORIES: Minerals, Chemistry

Flotation is a process where gas bubbles are injected at the bottom of a tank containing a mixture of a liquid and solid particles to separate the solid particles from the liquid. When the gas bubbles move along the liquid mixture, the solids particles stick to the surface of the bubbles. The bubbles form a foam at the surface of the liquid: this foam contains the solid particles, so after the flotation process the solids can be removed just cleaning the liquid from this foam.

[[Gangue]]

CATEGORIES: Minerals

Gangue is the worthless substance that is left behind when minerals are processed. 

When minerals are collected, the ore that is wanted is found only in small amounts. Flotation is used to concentrate the ore. The ore floats while the gangue sinks to the bottom. Sometimes minerals thought of as gangue are later recovered and used.

[[Abstract art]]

CATEGORIES: Art movements

Abstract art is modern art which does not represent images of our everyday world. It has colour, lines and shapes (form), but they are not intended to represent objects or living things. Often the artists were influenced by ideas and philosophies of abstraction.

Abstract art is found in painting and in sculpture. There are also many works of art which are partly abstract, and partly representational. Many artists worked in abstract and other types of modern art.

Purely abstract art is a 20th-century invention. It grew out of the earlier forms of modern art, but it is perhaps the one movement which is absolutely modern. It has no roots in earlier art (as we use the term today).

[[Myelin]]

CATEGORIES: Anatomy of the nervous system

Myelin is a substance that forms the coating of axons in the brain and the rest of the central nervous system. This coating is also known as the myelin sheath. It is a substance made of about 80% lipid and 20% protein. Its main function is to speed the relay of electricity messages in the nervous system. It is milky white and slippery in appearance and texture, giving rise to the term white matter in the brain.

Myelin is an important part of proper neural function. In later life, a process called demyelination can occur, causing poor neural function. Demyelination may be a cause of Alzheimer's disease. Multiple sclerosis happens when myelin is damaged.

[[Chemical composition]]

CATEGORIES: Analytical chemistry

Chemical composition is the arrangement, type, and ratio of atoms in molecules of chemical substances. Chemical composition varies when chemicals are added or subtracted from a substance, when the ratio of substances changes, or when other chemical changes occur in chemicals. Chemical formulas show this information.

The chemical composition of a substance determines the intramolecular forces and properties of the substance.  This means that the way atoms are put together in something determines the color, density, strength, texture and other properties of the thing.  Chemists can use tests to learn the chemical composition of a substance, including a pH test, flammability test, heavy metal test etc. 

A particular chemical has a particular ratio of its atoms, allowed by their valence (chemistry). An example is Hydrogen Fluoride, or HF, which has 1 Hydrogen atom in ratio to every 1 Fluorine atom.  This substance has strong intramolecular forces of attraction because it is a hydrogen bond. chem-stub

The London Zoo is the world's oldest scientific zoo. It was opened in London on 27 April 1828, and was originally intended to be used as a collection for scientific study. It was eventually opened to the public in 1847. Today it has a collection of 673 species of animals, with 19,289 individuals, making it one of the largest collections in the United Kingdom.

It is managed by the Zoological Society of London (ZSL), established in 1826. It is at the northern edge of Regent's Park, on the boundary line between City of Westminster and Camden (the Regent's Canal runs through it). The Society also has a larger site at ZSL Whipsnade Zoo in Bedfordshire to which the larger animals such as elephants and rhinos have been moved.

As well as being the first scientific zoo, ZSL London Zoo also opened the first Reptile house (1849), first public Aquarium (1853), first insect house (1881) and the first children's zoo (1938).

ZSL receives no state funding and relies on 'Fellows', 'Friends', 'Members', entrance fees and sponsorship to get income.

However, the ZSL's nearby Institute of Zoology may get public grants as a scientific institution. It has an international reputation in bioconservation.

[[Icelandic name]]

CATEGORIES: Iceland

frame|right|The Icelandic patronymic naming system.Icelandic names are different from most other naming systems used in the West, in that the names follow a patronymic (sometimes matronymic) surname pattern. 

This means that when a person is named, their last name is the name of their father, plus -son. So if a man called Eric had a son called Leif, Leif's name would be Leif Ericsson. 

The same is true for females, although sometimes women take the name of their father for their last name, or the name of their mother. Also, the suffix -dottír is added to the end of the parent's name. So, if a girl called Astrid's parents were Leif and Inga, then their daughter could be called either Astrid Leifsdóttir, or Astrid Ingasdóttir. 

Changes were announced to the laws about names in 2019. Given names are not limited by gender anymore. People that are registered officially with a non-binary gender will be able to use the suffix -bur ("child of") instead of -son or -dóttir.

This naming system is the same naming system that was used by the Vikings. Iceland has kept this naming system because Iceland is an island, and had little contact with the outside world for quite some time, so there was not much change in things like customs, language and naming systems.

Fruitadens is a small ornithischian dinosaur, with young adults estimated at 65 to 75 cm (26 to 30 in) in length and 0.5 to 0.75 kg (1.1 to 1.7 lb) in weight. 

The lower jaws had an enlarged canine-like tooth, opposite a gap in the upper jaw (a 'diastema'). Unlike Echinodon, there wasn't an enlarged tooth in the upper jaw. A small peg-like tooth was present in front of the canine-like tooth. Replacement teeth were present in the jaws, unlike most other heterodontosaurids. Fruitadens was an omnivore.

[[Mechanical wave]]

CATEGORIES: Physics

A mechanical wave requires a medium. Sound waves, waves in a Slinky, and pressure waves are all examples of this phenomenon. Sound waves need a physical medium in order to exist; the Slinky waves need the Slinky, and the waves in the ocean need the water. Like all waves, they have a frequency, period, wavelength and amplitude.

Mechanical waves are a local oscillation of material. Only the energy propagates; the oscillating material does not move far from its initial equilibrium position; the wave travels by jumping from one particle of the transmission medium to another. Therefore, mechanical waves transport energy and not material.

The white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), also known as the whitetail or Virginia deer, is a type of deer that is found throughout most of North America, and only some in South America. The white-tailed deer were also brought over to Europe and New Zealand.

The white-tailed deer is normally between around 57 and 137 kilograms (125 to 301 pounds) in weight.  Its body is between 160 and 220 centimeters (63 to 86 inches) long.  It is mostly colored brown, but can also be greyish or reddish in winter and summer.  Male white-tailed deer have large antlers. These fall off in the winter.  The white-tailed deer mostly lives between two and three years long.  Sometimes, though, they will live for more than ten years.

This type of deer is quite shy.  When they are scared, they run very fast, and wave their tails.  They mostly stay alone and in the same location throughout the year.  During the autumn, the deer engage in mating.

They mostly eat vegetation like tree leaves or smaller plants.  The deer feed mostly during the morning and evening.

Predators of the white-tailed deer include wolves, coyotes, bears and mountain lions, as well as humans.

CATEGORIES: Architectural styles

Googie is the term given to a type of architecture and art in the United States in the 20th century.  It is also called Doo Wop, Atomic age, or populuxe.   It was very futuristic, echoing themes of the 1950s as a whole.  Some of Googie architecture was based on what spaceships look like.  It started in California soon after World War II and spread to the rest of the United States in the 1950s.  Many of the buildings built in the Googie style were coffee shops, bowling alleys and motels.  

Here are a few famous Googie buildings:

[[Sharecropping]]

CATEGORIES: History of the United States, Labor, Agriculture, Property

Sharecropping is a term for when one person farms another person's land, and then the two share what is produced.  Sharecroppers are almost always poor, and are often in debt to landowners or other people.  Sharecropping was very common in the Southern United States after the Civil War and the end of slavery. At that time, many African-Americans sharecropped on the land that they had once farmed as slaves.  Sharecropping was part of the system of "Jim Crow", which kept blacks poor and not really citizens.

Sharecropping became more common in the Southern United States when slavery was abolished. During the 20th century it became rare there.

[[Grade (education)]]

CATEGORIES: Education

Grades are a teacher's evaluation of a student's performance. They are often letters (e.g. A, B, C, D, F,) or numbers (e.g. 1-10.), although in some countries they do not use either of these systems.

Letter grades are most commonly used in the United States and some others. The grades D or C are usually enough to pass.

Grades can also be on a number scale. Typically a midpoint score is a pass. Sometimes the numbers can go in descending order to indicate better performance.

A Grade Point Average, or GPA, takes the grade(s) of a student and assigns point values to them. These points are added up and divided to calculate the GPA.

Simple grades can be found with this formula:

The grade is the answer to that formula turned into a percent.

This is the type of grading the United States uses the most:

[[Elaphrosaurus]]

CATEGORIES: Dinosaurs of Africa, Ceratosaurs, Jurassic dinosaurs

Elaphrosaurus is a genus of theropod dinosaur that lived during the Upper Jurassic period, about 150 million years ago. It was 15 feet long, and weighed 450 pounds. 

Elaphrosaurus was a slender, fast, and agile predator that probably preyed on small ornithopods, such as Dryosaurus. 

The type specimen was found in the Tendaguru Formation in Tanzania. It was a nearly complete skeleton, but unfortunately, it lacked a skull. Since its body was similar to ornithomimids, it was originally thought to be the earliest ornithomimid. However, later studies showed that it is actually a ceratosaur. There is one named species, Elaphrosaurus bambergi. Remains very similar to it have also been found in the Morrison Formation in the western United States. These may possibly belong to Elaphrosaurus, indicating that this dinosaur had a wider range than previously thought.

[[United States Numbered Highways]]

CATEGORIES: U.S. Highways

The United States Numbered Highways is a national system of roads in the United States. These roads connect to places across the country. Some of the roads are freeways, which means cars must use ramps in order to get on or off the road, but others are surface roads. Many U.S. Highways, such as U.S. Route 66, have had their numbers removed because of the creation  of the Interstate Highway System.

[[Indentured servant]]

CATEGORIES: Occupations, Human rights abuses, Slavery

An indentured servant was a worker in a contract with an employer for a certain length of time. Usually a laborer or craftsman would have to work three to seven years in exchange for the cost of transportation across the ocean, food, clothing, land, a place to live and other things they needed to live or work during their contract. This kind of contract was called "indenture."  Indentures were quite common in Colonial America in the 17th and 18th centuries.

[[Toxicofera]]

CATEGORIES: scaled reptiles

Toxicofera (Greek or Latin for "those who carry toxins"), is a hypothetical clade of living Squamata (lizards and snakes). It includes about 4600 living species. This is all venomous reptile species, plus related non-venomous species.

The clade was identified when research showed that the evolution of venom was very ancient, and that it might have occurred only once.

[[Balaur]]

CATEGORIES: Dromaeosauridae, Cretaceous dinosaurs

Balaur is a genus of dromaeosaurid theropod dinosaur that lived in southern Europe during the Upper Cretaceous, about 70 million years ago. 

The specimen is unique: unlike most other dromaeosaurs, it had two sickle claws on each foot, not just one. It had a reduced and presumably nonfunctional third finger, consisting of only one rudimentary phalanx.

The specimen was discovered in 2010. Balaur lived on a large prehistoric island called Hateg Island. Seventy million years ago, sea levels were much higher than they are today. Europe was an archipelago of islands. 

Possibly because it was relatively isolated from other dinosaurs, Balaur developed unique features. It was a small 1.8. This is an example of island dwarfism.

There is one known species, Balaur bondoc. Balaur was a velociraptorine. Studies have shown that it is most closely related to the famous Asian dromaeosaurid Velociraptor.

[[Book of Optics]]

CATEGORIES: Science books

The Book of Optics is a book that was written by Ibn al Haytham (965–1040 CE), an Arabic scientist and polymath. It was a seven-volume treatise on optics, physics, mathematics, anatomy and psychology, from 1011 to 1021. It was originally written in Arabic and was later translated into Persian, Latin and Italian within the next several centuries. The book had an important influence on the development of optics and on science in general because it introduced the experimental scientific method. Ibn al-Haytham has been called the "father of modern optics". Ibn al-Haytham wrote more than 200 works on a wide range of subjects, of which at least 96 of his scientific works are known.

the book of optics is also written en part by Ibn al-Haythams nephew at four years old

Princess Helen of Serbia (4 November 1884 – 16 October 1962) was the daughter of King Peter I of Yugoslavia and his wife Princess Zorka of Montenegro. She was the older sister of George, Crown Prince of Serbia and Alexander I of Yugoslavia. Helen was also a niece of Anastasia of Montenegro, or Stana, wife of Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich of Russia, and of Milica of Montenegro. They were the women who introduced Grigori Rasputin to Tsarina Alexandra. She was born as Princess Jelena of Serbia. Her mother died when she was younger, so she was brought up mostly by her aunts. After she was married, she was known as Elena Petrovna, Jelena Petrovna, Hélène Petrovna or Ellen Petrovna. Grand Duchess Olga Nikolaevna of Russia liked her very much. After the Imperial family died, she was questioned about Anastasia Nikolaevna. When she was put in prison for a short time at Perm in 1918, she said that a guard took a girl who called herself Anastasia Romanova to her cell and asked her if the girl was the Tsar's daughter. When she did not recognize the girl, the guard took her away.

[[Sulla]]

CATEGORIES: 2nd century BC births, 78 BC deaths, Former dictators, Roman generals

Lucius Cornelius Sulla  (c. 138 BC – 78 BC), usually called Sulla, was a Roman general and statesman. He was a praetor (a commander of an army) in 97 BC, and held the office of Consul twice. He was the only man in history to have attacked and kept both Athens and Rome.

Sulla unconstitutionally marched his armies into Rome and defeated his enemy Gaius Marius in battle. After his second march on Rome, he revived the office of dictator. Sulla was made Dictator in 81 or 82 BC. He had the Senate draw up a list of those he considered enemies of the state and published the list in the Roman Forum. Plutarch states in his Life of Sulla (XXXI): "Sulla now began to make blood flow, and he filled the city with deaths without number or limit".

This was remembered when Caesar became Dictator.

[[Shortening]]

CATEGORIES: Cooking fats, Baking

Shortening is a semisolid fat used in baking. It makes foods crumbly. Shortening doesn't smoke as easily as butter or oil, and it is 100% fat. Butter is 80% fat. It works by stopping long gluten polymers from forming in the food. It does not need to be refrigerated. It also is cheaper than butter. It can make foods last longer. 

Shortening is mostly made from hydrogenated oils, which have trans fats in them. Trans fats can cause heart attacks. People making shortening try to take out the trans fats.

[[Semisolid]]

CATEGORIES: Chemistry

A semisolid is a substance that is in between a solid and a liquid. Another name for a semi-solid is a quasi-solid. Mayonnaise is an example of a semi-solid. Mayonnaise does not hold its shape like a solid but does not flow like a liquid. A substance like gel or cream is another example of a semi-solid. Normally semi-solids are covalent things. Covalent substances get softer and softer until they melt. Ionic substances melt at one temperature and do not get softer. Butter can be a semisolid when it is warm. Butter does not hold its shape but it does not flow like a liquid. Paint is also a semisolid, since it is highly viscous.

[[Hydrogenation]]

CATEGORIES: Chemistry

Hydrogenation is the process of adding hydrogen to organic compounds. It is done to alkenes. 

Vegetable oils have alkenes in them. Alkenes are liquid and spoil easily. People making shortening add hydrogen to the alkene, turning it into an alkane. The alkanes are more solid and stable. A catalyst is used to react the hydrogen with the oil. This makes trans fats, though. Margarine is an example of a hydrogenated spread.

Other things can be hydrogenated, too. Hot nitrogen is reacted with hydrogen under high pressure with a catalyst, usually nickel to make ammonia gas.

[[Quiche]]

[[Bradyon]]

CATEGORIES: Subatomic particles

Bradyons, also known as tardyons or ittyons, are very small particles that travel below the speed of light, as opposed to hypothetical tachyons (which travel above the speed of light). All known subatomic particles which have mass are bradyons.

[[Higgs field]]

CATEGORIES: Quantum mechanics

The Higgs field is a field of energy that is thought to exist in every region of the universe. The field is accompanied by a fundamental particle known as the Higgs boson, which is used by the field to continuously interact with other particles, such as the electron. Particles that interact with the field are "given" mass and, in a similar fashion to an object passing through a treacle (or molasses), will become slower as they pass through it. The result of a particle "gaining" mass from the field is the prevention of its ability to travel at the speed of light.

Mass itself is not generated by the Higgs field; the act of creating matter or energy from nothing would violate the laws of conservation. Mass is, however, gained by particles via their Higgs field interactions with the Higgs Boson. Higgs bosons contain the relative mass in the form of energy and once the field has endowed a formerly massless particle, the particle in question will slow down as it has now become "heavy". 

If the Higgs field did not exist, particles would not have the mass required to attract one another, and would float around freely at light speed. Also, gravity would not exist because mass would not be there to attract other mass.

Giving mass to an object is referred to as the Higgs effect. This effect will transfer mass or energy to any particle that passes through it. Light that passes through it gains energy, not mass, because its wave form doesn't have mass, while its particle form constantly travels at light speed.

[[Equal Rights Amendment]]

CATEGORIES: Proposed amendments to the United States Constitution, Feminism, Human rights

The Equal Rights Amendment is a proposed amendment to the United States Constitution in the 1970s and 1980s.  It would give men and women full equality under the law.  Alice Paul first wrote the ERA. In 1923, it was introduced in the Congress for the first time. It passed both houses of Congress in 1972 after the National Organization for Women protested outside the United States Senate.  Some people opposed it because women were already becoming equal in most areas, and women did not want to be drafted into the Vietnam War.  Though 35 states ratified it, the amendment did not pass (38 were needed).  Most of the states that did not ratify it were in the Southern United States, which is the most conservative and religious part of the country.

Twenty-one states have a version of the ERA in their state constitutions. Sixteen of those states ratified the federal ERA. Five did not.

The ERA was introduced into Congress each year from 1923 to 1972.  It has been reintroduced in every session of Congress since 1982. In 2011, it was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives by 159 House cosponsors and several senators.

Arabidopsis is a popular tool for understanding the molecular biology of many plant traits, including flower development and light sensing.

[[Dracovenator]]

CATEGORIES: Dinosaurs of Africa, Ceratosaurs, Jurassic dinosaurs

Dracovenator  was a genus of theropod dinosaur that lived in southern Africa during the Lower Jurassic period. That was about 185 million years ago. It is closely related to Dilophosaurus. It might have had a pair of crests like Dilophosaurus.

Its name means "Dragon hunter". It was given this name because dinosaurs are similar to the dragons of mythology, and it was a carnivore, so it was probably a hunter. 

Dracovenator was a large carnivore, about 23 feet long. It is the first large meat-eating dinosaur from the Lower Jurassic of Africa to be discovered. Dracovenator was described and named in 2006, based on a hand claw, an upper jaw with teeth, back bones, hip bones, ribs, and foot bones. There is one named species, Dracovenator regenti. Dracovenator was discovered in the upper Elliot Formation in South Africa.

[[Alphonse Mucha]]

CATEGORIES: 1860 births, 1939 deaths, Czech artists, Czech painters

Alphonse Mucha (24 July 1860 – 14 July 1939) was a Czech Art Nouveau painter and decorative artist, best known for his distinct style and his images of women. He produced many paintings, illustrations, advertisements, and designs.

Mucha moved to Paris in 1887, continued his studies, and worked at producing magazine and advertising illustrations.

Around Christmas 1894, Mucha happened to drop into a print shop where there was a sudden and unexpected need for a new advertising poster for a play starring Sarah Bernhardt, the most famous actress in Paris. Mucha volunteered to produce a lithographed poster within two weeks, and on 1 January 1895, the advertisement for the play Gismonda by Victorien Sardou appeared on the streets of the city. It was an overnight sensation and announced the new artistic style and its creator to the citizens of Paris. Bernhardt was so satisfied with the success of this first poster that she entered into a 6-year contract with Mucha.

Mucha produced a flurry of paintings, posters, advertisements, and book illustrations, as well as designs for jewellery, carpets, wallpaper, and theatre sets in what was initially called the Mucha Style but became known as Art Nouveau (French for 'new art'). Mucha's works frequently featured beautiful, strong young women in flowing vaguely Neoclassical looking robes, often surrounded by lush flowers which sometimes formed halos behind the women's heads.

In contrast with contemporary poster makers he used pale pastel colours.

The 1900 Paris Exhibition spread the "Mucha style" abroad, of which Mucha said "I think Exposition Universelle made some contribution toward bringing aesthetic values into arts and crafts."

He decorated the Bosnia and Herzegovina Pavilion and collaborated in the Austrian Pavilion.

Mucha's Art Nouveau style was often imitated. The Art Nouveau style however, was one that Mucha attempted to distance himself from. He always insisted that his paintings came purely from within and from Czech art. He declared that art existed only to communicate a spiritual message, and nothing more. He was frustrated at the fame he gained through commercial art, when he most wanted to concentrate on more lofty projects that would ennoble art and his birthplace.

[[Baldness]]

CATEGORIES: Hair, Health

Baldness (also known as alopecia) is when someone has no hair on his or her head. Sometimes this is inherited from parents or grandparents, or it can be done on purpose if somebody cuts off all their hair off. Some monks or South Korean soldiers in the army do this.

Baldness is most often caused by a medical condition known as androgenic alopecia. This is found in humans, as well as in some animals. When it occurs, it will mean that those affected will permanently lose some (or all) of their hair. Since some of the factors are linked to the genes on the chromosome, the condition can be seen more often with men, than with women.

Alopecia totalis is the loss of all head hair. Its cause is believed to be autoimmune, but many with the disorder lead relatively low stress lives.

Alopecia areata (AA) is a condition in which hair is lost from some or all areas of the body, usually from the scalp.12 Because it causes bald spots on the scalp, especially in the first stages, it is sometimes called spot baldness.

There were several species of Deinotherium that inhabited parts of Africa, Asia and Europe. The Deinotherium was larger than today’s elephants.

The way Deinotherium used its curious tusks has been much debated. It may have rooted in soil for underground plant parts like roots and tubers, pulled down branches to snap them and reach leaves, or stripped soft bark from tree trunks. Deinotherium fossils have been uncovered at several of the African sites where remains of prehistoric hominid relatives of modern humans have also been found.

[[Regular expression]]

CATEGORIES: Theoretical computer science

A regular expression (abbreviated regexp or regex) is a way to describe sets of characters using syntactic rules. Many programming languages use or support regular expressions. A regular expression is then used by a special program or part of a programming language. This program will either generate a parser that can be used to match expressions or it will match such expressions itself. 

A regular expression processor is used for processing a regular expression statement in terms of a grammar in a given formal language, and with that examines a text string. 

A few examples of what can be matched with regular expressions:

Regular expressions can be much more complex than these examples. Many regular expression languages also support "wildcard" characters.

[[1985 Pacific hurricane season]]

CATEGORIES: Pacific hurricane seasons, 1985

The 1985 Pacific hurricane season was an  event in tropical cyclone meteorology. It officially started on May 15, 1985 in the eastern Pacific, and on June 1, 1985 in the central Pacific, and lasted until November 30, 1985. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean.

At the time, the 1985 season was the most active on record in the eastern north Pacific (breaking a short-lived record set in 1983), with 25 tropical cyclones forming. Of those, 22 attained tropical storm intensity, 12 reaching hurricane intensity and 8 becoming major hurricanes by reaching Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson Scale. In addition, three additional systems formed in the central north Pacific, of which one became a hurricane and another became a typhoon before re-crossing the international dateline.

Despite the activity, there were few notable systems this year. The only cyclone to make landfall was Hurricane Waldo, which caused damage in Mexico. Elsewhere, surf from Hurricane Pauline caused damage in Hawaii and either Pauline or the following system sank a sailing vessel.

[[Coordination geometry]]

[[Triclinic]]

CATEGORIES: Chemistry, Minerals

A triclinic crystal is shaped almost like a rectangle. It is slightly bent, though. Copper sulfate makes triclinic crystals. It is the least symmetric (meaning that both sides are not very similar). 

. In the triclinic system, the crystal is described by vectors of unequal length, as in the orthorhombic system. 

[[Crystal structure]]

CATEGORIES: Analytical chemistry, Minerals

In crystallography, the crystal structure is how the atoms (or ions or molecules) are arranged in a crystalline material. Crystals occur naturally from the way the chemical bonds of the atoms connect. Symmetric repeating patterns occur in 3-D space in the crystal.

The crystal structure and symmetry cause many physical properties, such as cleavage (how the crystal splits) how it conducts electricity, and its optical properties..

The crystal structure of a chemical is the shape of the crystal at the molecular level. There are several shapes of crystals. Sodium chloride is a cube. Copper sulfate is triclinic. Most things, even metals, have crystal structures. Some crystals fit more atoms in them than others, and these crystals usually weigh more.

The term 'hazard' is used in driving instruction, and in some traffic-related laws. It simply means 'something a motorist should notice and drive accordingly'. For example, children playing on the pavement (U.S. = sidewalk; Austr. = footpath) are a potential hazard. If any go into the actual road, then they are a real hazard, and motorist should do whatever is safe.

CATEGORIES: Foods, Fungi, Medicinal plants, Vulnerable species

Fly agaric (Amanita muscaria) is a poisonous and psychoactive basidiomycete fungus, one of many in the genus Amanita. Native throughout the temperate and boreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere, Amanita muscaria has been unintentionally introduced to many countries in the southern hemisphere, generally as a symbiont with pine plantations, and is now a true cosmopolitan species. The quintessential toadstool, it is a large white-gilled, white-spotted, usually deep red mushroom, one of the most recognizable and widely encountered in popular culture. Although it is generally considered poisonous, deaths from its consumption are extremely rare, and it is eaten as a food in parts of Europe, Asia, and North America after parboiling. Amanita muscaria is noted for its hallucinogenic properties, with its main psychoactive constituent being the compound muscimol. It was used as an intoxicant and entheogen by the peoples of Siberia and has a religious significance in these cultures. There has been much speculation on traditional use of this mushroom as an intoxicant in places other than Siberia; however, such traditions are far less well documented.

[[MicroSD]]

CATEGORIES: 2005, Storage devices

microSD is a type of removable flash memory card used for storing information.  SD is an abbreviation of Secure Digital, and microSD cards are sometimes referred to as µSD or uSD.   The cards are used in mobile phones and other mobile devices.

It is the smallest memory card that can be bought; at 15 mm × 11 mm × 1 mm (about the size of a fingernail), it is about a quarter of the size of a normal-sized SD card.  There are adapters that make the small microSD able to fit in devices that have slots for standard SD, miniSD, Memory Stick Duo card, and even USB. But, not all of the different cards can work together. Many microSD cards are sold with a standard SD adapter, so that people can use them in devices that take standard SD but not microSD cards.

TransFlash and microSD cards are the same (they can be used in place of each other), but microSD has support for SDIO mode. This lets microSD slots support non-memory jobs like Bluetooth, GPS, and Near Field Communication by attaching a device in place of a memory card.

MicroSDHC format is a newer version of the MicroSD which is not backwards compatible.  Some older devices cannot use the newer format, although third party firmware is available for some devices.

TransFlash cards are sold in 16MB and 32MB sizes. microSD cards are sold in many sizes, from 64 MB to 32 GB, while microSDHC cards are sold in sizes between 4 GB to 64 GB.  Larger ones are microSDXC memory cards, sold in sizes between 8 GB and 1 TB.

He had a great influence on his cousin-in-law Vincent van Gogh.

Mauve mostly painted people and animals shown outdoors. The paining Morning Ride shows well-dressed riders at the coast of the sea, as they ride away from the viewer. One detail which is uncommon, but shows his realism are the horse droppings shown in the foreground of the picture. His best-known paintings show peasants working in the fields, and sheep-herding scenes.

[[Vespasian]]

CATEGORIES: 9 births, 79 deaths, Roman Emperors

Vespasian (Titus Flavius Vespasianus, 17 November 9 AD – 23 June 79), was Roman Emperor from 69 AD to 79.

Vespasian was the founder of the Flavian dynasty which ruled the empire for a quarter century. Although he held the consulship in 51 AD, Vespasian became more highly regarded as a successful military commander. He took part in the Roman invasion of Britain in 43 AD,p16 and the Jewish rebellion of 66 AD.p29–38

While Vespasian was preparing to besiege Jerusalem during the latter campaign, emperor Nero committed suicide, plunging the empire into a year of civil war known as the Year of the Four Emperors. After the emperors Galba and Otho died in quick succession, Vitellius became emperor in April 69 AD.

In response, the armies in Egypt and Judaea declared Vespasian emperor on July 1.p43 In his bid for imperial power, Vespasian joined forces with Mucianus, the governor of Syria, and Primus, a general in Pannonia. Primus and Mucianus led the Flavian forces against Vitellius, while Vespasian gained control of Egypt. On 20 December, Vitellius was defeated, and the following day Vespasian was declared emperor by the Roman Senate.

Little factual information survives about Vespasian's government during the ten years he was emperor. His reign is best known for financial reforms, the successful campaign against Judaea, and several ambitious construction projects such as the Colosseum. Upon his death in 79, he was succeeded by his eldest son Titus.

[[Nerva]]

CATEGORIES: 30 births, 98 deaths, Roman Emperors

Nerva (Marcus Cocceius Nerva, 8 November 30 – 25 January 98) was Roman Emperor from 96 to 98.

Nerva became emperor at the age of sixty-five, after a lifetime of imperial service under Nero and the rulers of the Flavian dynasty. Under Nero, he was a member of the imperial team, and played a vital part in exposing the Pisonian conspiracy of 65.

Later, as a loyalist to the Flavians, he attained consulships in 71 and 90 during the reigns of Vespasian and Domitian respectively.

On 18 September 96, Domitian was assassinated in a palace conspiracy. On the same day, Nerva was declared emperor by the Roman Senate. As the new ruler of the Roman Empire, he vowed to restore liberties which had been cut during the autocratic government of Domitian.

Nerva's brief reign was marred by financial difficulties and his inability to assert his authority over the Roman army.

A revolt by the Praetorian Guard in October 97 caused him to adopt an heir. After some deliberation Nerva adopted Trajan, a young and popular general, as his successor. After barely fifteen months in office, Nerva died of natural causes.

Although much of his life remains obscure, Nerva was considered a wise and moderate emperor by ancient historians. Recent historians have revised this assessment, characterizing Nerva as a well-intentioned but ultimately weak ruler, whose reign brought the Roman Empire to the brink of civil war.

Nerva's greatest success was his choice of Trajan. This led to a peaceful transition after his death, thus founding the Nerva-Antonine dynasty.

Aliens is an American science fiction-action horror movie released in 1986. It is a science fiction movie because it takes place in outer space and there are alien creatures. It was directed by James Cameron and stars Sigourney Weaver, Michael Biehn and Lance Henriksen. Aliens is a sequel to Alien (1979) and was followed by two more sequels; Alien³ (1992) and Alien: Resurrection (1997).

This one is different than the original movie because instead of it being just a horror movie, it has more action in it and there is more than one alien in it, as said in the title of the movie.

[[Evolutionary suicide]]

CATEGORIES: Evolutionary biology

Evolutionary suicide is not a standard term in evolutionary biology. It is not used in any standard textbook on evolution.

It is the incorrect idea that the adaptation of an individual animal works in such a way that an entire species dies out. The idea is that evolution makes plants and animals pass on their genes to the next generation more efficiently, but it does not guarantee the survival of the population or the species. Obviously, that is true, and extinction occurs often. Evolution cannot foresee the future. This is, however, nothing at all to do with suicide.

A candidate for a future evolutionary suicide might be cod. Cod is caught as fish by humans. The fish do not weigh as much as they used to, mostly because they do not survive long enough. They do, however, mature earlier. Although this means the number of eggs per female fish is reduced, its effect depends rather on the extent of overfishing. Data suggests that when fishing is controlled, cod numbers return to their former level. This was the lesson of World War II, when cod fishing in many areas was greatly reduced, and pre-war cod numbers recovered.

The Haitian Revolution (1791–1804) was a conflict in the French colony of Saint-Domingue, leading to the abolition of slavery in Haiti and the formation of Haiti as the first modern republic ruled by Africans.  It was the biggest slave rebellion since the Zanj rebellion in Iraq, which also lasted 14 years. Its leaders were former slaves who decided to fight for freedom, like Toussaint L'ouverture, Cécile Fatiman, Dutty Boukman, and Jean-Jacques Dessalines.  The Haitian Revolution led to Haiti being the second nation in the Americas (after the United States) formed from a European colony, and the first one to ban slavery.

CATEGORIES: Dinosaurs of Africa, Titanosaurs

Janenschia (named after Werner Janensch) was a huge, plant-eating dinosaur with an elongated neck and tail. It was a sauropod from the late Jurassic period, about 156 million to 150 million years ago. Janenschia had a small head, blunt teeth, and a short, thick tail; it was about 80 feet (24 m) long. This titanosaurid back may have been covered with bony, armored plates. Fossils have been found in Tanzania, Africa. It is said that this dinosaur was a secondary prey for T-rex.

[[Hadrian]]

CATEGORIES: 76 births, 138 deaths, Roman Emperors

Hadrian (Publius Aelius Hadrianus, 24 January 76 – 10 July 138) was Roman Emperor from 117 to 138.

He is best known for building Hadrian's Wall, which marked the northern limit of Roman territory in Britain. In Rome, he built the Pantheon and the Temple of Venus and Roma.

In addition to being emperor, Hadrian was a humanist and a lover of Greek culture in all his tastes. Hadrian was the third of the so-called Five Good Emperors.

Hadrian was born to a Hispano-Roman family, probably in Italica (near Seville). His predecessor Trajan was a maternal cousin of Hadrian's father. Trajan never officially designated an heir, but according to his wife Pompeia Plotina, Trajan named Hadrian emperor immediately before his death. Trajan's wife and his friend Licinius Sura were well-disposed towards Hadrian, and he may well have owed his succession to them.

During his reign, Hadrian traveled to nearly every province of the empire. Hadrian sought to make Athens the cultural capital of the empire: he ordered the construction of many temples in the city.

Hadrian spent much of his time with the military. He usually wore military attire, and dined and slept amongst the soldiers. He ordered military training and drilling to be more rigorous and even made use of false reports of attack to keep the army alert. Despite his fondness for the army, there was little military activity throughout the empire while Hadrian reigned. After he became emperor, Hadrian withdrew from Trajan's conquests in Mesopotamia and Armenia, and even considered abandoning Dacia. Late in his reign, he stopped the Bar Kokhba revolt in Judaea, renaming the province Syria Palaestina.

In 136 an ailing Hadrian adopted Lucius Aelius as his heir, but he died suddenly two years later. In 138, Hadrian promised to adopt Antoninus Pius if he would in turn adopt Marcus Aurelius and Aelius' son Lucius Verus as his own eventual successors. Antoninus agreed, and soon afterward Hadrian died at his villa near Tibur.

Revere was a member of a group called The Sons of Liberty. This group wanted better treatment for the American colonies from the British government. Revere made a silver engraving of the Boston Massacre. This engraving made Americans even more angry with the British.

Revere was a courier and soldier in the American Revolution. After the Revolutionary War, he operated a metal foundry in Boston. He died in Boston, and was buried in the Granary Burying Ground. He is most famous for alerting the colonial militia that British soldiers were coming before the Battles of Lexington and Concord. In 1860, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow wrote a poem about this called "Paul Revere's Ride."

[[Sinterklaas]]

Sinterklaas (also called Sint Nicolaas) is a traditional Winter holiday figure in Dutch-speaking Europe (The Netherlands and Flanders), and is also well known in the former Dutch colonies. Every year he is celebrated in The Netherlands, one day before Saint Nicholas died (5 December) and on (6 December) in Belgium. His helper and best friend is Black Peter. Sinterklaas is the basis of the mythical holiday figure of Santa Claus in the United States. Sinterklaas has nothing to do with Christmas. Christmas will also be celebrated in the Netherlands as well as in Belgium, so Santa Claus is not the same as Sinterklaas (in the Netherlands). Sinterklaas arrives from Spain in a boat and has a white horse that can walk across rooftops. Every little kid puts his shoe at the chimney (or the window) and sings a song, when the kid goes to sleep sinterklaas comes and puts a present in the shoe.

Auto mechanics can either know all about all the different parts that let the car work, or they can specialize in one specific kind of part or car. People go to auto mechanics for many reasons: They might need to get a new car part, they might need to find out what is wrong with their car, or they might want to add something new to the car to make it better. Auto mechanics almost always work in places called garages, that are made for the work that auto mechanics do.

The 2007 Scottish Parliament election was an election held on 3 May 2007 to elect members to the Scottish Parliament.

Going into the election, the Scottish Labour Party had the largest number of seats and had a coalition agreement with the Scottish Liberal Democrats with Jack McConnell as First Minister. The Scottish National Party won 47 seats in the election, which was the largest number of seats for any party in the election, but was not enough to form a majority government. The Scottish National Party then formed a minority government with Alex Salmond as First Minister.

This was the first time since the 1964 UK General Election in which the Labour Party did not get the highest number of votes in Scotland and it also gave the Scottish National Party it's largest ever number of votes. The final results were: Scottish National Party (47 Seats), Scottish Labour Party (46 Seats), Scottish Conservative Party (17 Seats), Scottish Liberal Democrats (16 Seats) and the Scottish Green Party (2 Seats). Parties which had won seats in the 2003 Scottish Parliament election including the Scottish Socialist Party and the Scottish Senior Citizens Party, lost all of their seats.

[[Hedge]]

CATEGORIES: Trees, Ecology

A hedge or hedgerow is a close-knit row of shrubs and sometimes tree species. They were usually planted and "trained" to form a barrier. They marked the boundary of an area, and so were a sign of possession. 

Livestock farmers use them to prevent cattle straying out of fields. Animals which cannot usually be contained in fields (hill sheep for example) need a man and dog to look after them, which is an expense. Hedges were much more common before modern agriculture. Modern crop farming uses machines to gather the crop, and so hedges have all but disappeared in some areas.

When hedges are first laid, they are usually all of one species. But over hundreds of years, the number of species in a hedge gradually increases, and often includes fully-grown trees. There are many hedges in Europe which have been there for 500 or a thousand years.

Making hedges into ornaments is a skill called topiary.  Sometimes, hedges are made into mazes.

Hedges are vitally important to small birds and mammals. In the modern world they play the role which thick forest undergrowth would have played in an ancient ecology. The nests in a hedge or thicket often cannot be got at by larger predators. Obviously tiny birds like robins or finches choose safe places to nest, and if they cannot, then their brood is unlikely to survive.

[[Cauchy distribution]]

CATEGORIES: Physics, Probability distributions

In mathematics, the Cauchy-Lorentz distribution (after Augustin-Louis Cauchy and Hendrik Lorentz) is a continuous probability distribution with two parameters: a location parameter and a scale parameter. As a probability distribution, it is usually called a Cauchy distribution. Physicists know it as a Lorentz distribution. 

The Cauchy distribution is used in spectroscopy to describe the spectral lines found there, and to describe resonance. It is also often used in statistics as the canonical example of a "pathological" distribution, since both its mean and its variance are undefined. The look of a Cauchy distribution is similar to that of a normal distribution, though with longer "tails". 

Due to this, estimating the mean value may not converge to any single value with more data (law of large numbers) unlike a normal distribution; due to a higher chance of getting extreme values (the tails of a frequency plot). 

[[Maze]]

CATEGORIES: Puzzles

A maze is a puzzle. It is made of a complex system of paths. Mazes can be on paper. They can also be big enough to walk through. Labyrinths, which are similar, have one winding path instead of many paths like a maze. Sometimes balls are placed in small mazes which have to be moved to the end through the maze. 

[[Emperor Norton]]

CATEGORIES: 1880 deaths, American people, 1819 births

Before he became emperor he was a citizen of San Francisco. Norton spent a lot of his early life in South Africa. Before he was emperor he made a living by being a businessman. He lost a lot of money by trying to control the rice market in San Francisco by buying all the rice he could find. This did not work because ships came with more rice. 

Emperor Norton I died on January 8, 1880. The reason of his death is unknown. He collapsed on the corner of California and Grant on his way to a lecture. The next day, he had his funeral. During Emperor Norton’s funeral, a solar eclipse took place. The whole city came to his funeral, and all of them mourned. Emperor Norton is now buried at Woodlawn Cemetery.

Quaesitosaurus (meaning "abnormal or extraordinary lizard") was a huge, long-necked, whip-tailed, plant-eating dinosaur that was found in the Gobi Desert in Mongolia. Quaesitosaurus may have been about 75 feet (23 m) long. This sauropod dinosaur lived during the late Cretaceous Period, roughly 85-80 million years ago. Quaesitosaurus may be the same as Nemegtosaurus. This environment was semi-arid during the Mesozoic Era.

[[Torvosaurus]]

CATEGORIES: Jurassic dinosaurs, Megalosauridae

Torvosaurus was a large carnivorous dinosaur, 

from the Upper Jurassic. It lived about 153 to 148 million years ago in what is now Colorado and Portugal.

Torvosaurus, possibly the largest carnivore of its time, was a large, heavily-built, bipedal carnivore. It grew to  9 to 11 meters (30 to 36 ft) in length and an estimated weight of about 2 metric tons (2.2 tons). Its hands and arms were about average for its size. In proportion, Allosaurus had more powerful arms, and T. rex had tiny arms.

Studies suggest that the paleoenvironment of this part of the Morrison Formation had rivers flowing from the west into a basin with a giant, saline alkaline lake. There were extensive wetlands nearby. Fossils from the Dry Mesa Dinosaur Quarry of western Colorado show one of the most diverse Upper Jurassic vertebrate assemblages in the world.   The Dry Mesa Quarry has produced the remains of the sauropods Apatosaurus, Diplodocus, Barosaurus, Supersaurus, Dystylosaurus, Camarasaurus, the iguanodontid Camptosaurus, and the theropods Allosaurus, Ceratosaurus and Ornitholestes, as well as  Dryosaurus, and Stegosaurus.

[[Covenant]]

CATEGORIES: Theology

A covenant is a formal agreement, a promise made between two people. It is often used as a religious promise. It can also be an item which is a symbol of keeping the promise. Some covenants include stone tablets, written documents, and other sacred items. In Judaism, the Ark of the Covenant was a wooden box which held the stone tablets with the Ten Commandments written on them. The Jewish people saw the box as a symbol of God being with them and leading them.

[[Marcus Aurelius]]

CATEGORIES: Roman Emperors

Marcus Aurelius Antoninus (26 April 121 – 17 March 180) was Roman Emperor from 161 to 180. He ruled with Lucius Verus as co-emperor from 161 until Verus' death in 169.

He was the last of the Five Good Emperors, and is considered one of the most important Stoic philosophers.

Marcus Aurelius' work Meditations, written in Greek while on campaign between 170 and 180, is still revered. It serves as an example of how Aurelius approached the Platonic ideal of a philosopher–king, and how he symbolized much of what was best about Roman civilization.

Michael Howard (born Michael Hecht, 7 July 1941) is a British politician who was the Leader of the Conservative Party from November 2003 to December 2005. He was also a cabinet minister in both Margaret Thatcher's and John Major's governments. He was a Member of Parliament for the constituency of Folkestone and Hythe from 1983 to 2010. In 2010, he entered the House of Lords as Baron Howard of Lympne.

Michael Howard was born in Gorseinon, a town in Swansea, Wales.   He is of Jewish descent. He studied Law at the University of Cambridge and became a Queen's Counsel in 1982. He then became a Member of Parliament at the 1983 General Election. His cabinet jobs included Secretary of State for Employment (1990-1992), Secretary of State for the Environment (1992-1993) and Home Secretary (1993-1997). When the Conservative Party lost the 1997 General Election, Michael Howard became a member of the shadow cabinets of William Hague and Iain Duncan Smith.

In 2003, the Leader of the Conservative Party Iain Duncan Smith was made to resign and Michael Howard was elected unopposed to become the Conservative Party leader. 'Unopposed' means that no-one other than Michael Howard was a candidate. Michael Howard was the Conservative candidate to become Prime Minister at the 2005 General Election. The Conservatives did not win the election, however they had 33 more seats in Parliament than they did before. Michael Howard resigned shortly after this and David Cameron replaced him as Conservative Party leader.

He was made a Companion of Honour in the 2011 Birthday Honours.

[[List of North American dinosaurs]]

CATEGORIES: Dinosaurs of North America, Lists of Dinosaurs

This is a list of dinosaurs whose remains have been recovered from North America. 

North America has a rich dinosaur fossil record with great diversity of dinosaurs. This may not mean the dinosaurs were more diverse or abundant; it may be because substantial resources have been devoted to the North American fossil record.

The Middle Jurassic is the only poorly represented time period in North America, although several Middle Jurassic localities are known from Mexico. Footprints, eggshells, teeth, and fragments of bone representing theropods, sauropods, and ornithopods have been found, but none of them are diagnostic to the genus level. 

The Upper Jurassic of North America, however, is the exact opposite of the Middle Jurassic. The Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation is found in several U.S. states, including Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, Montana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Texas. It is notable as being the most fertile single source of dinosaur fossils in the world.  

During the Lower Cretaceous, new dinosaurs appeared. Sauropods were still present, but they were not as diverse as they were in the Jurassic. Theropods from the early Cretaceous of North America include dromaeosaurs such as Deinonychus and Utahraptor, Acrocanthosaurus, and Microvenator. Sauropods included Astrodon, Pleurocoelus, and Sauroposeidon. Ornithischians were more diverse than they were in the Jurassic Period. Tenontosaurus, Hypsilophodon, Iguanodon, Protohadros, and Eolambia are some of the ornithopods that lived then. Ankylosaurs replaced their stegosaur cousins in the Cretaceous. Ankylosaurs from the early Cretaceous of North America include Sauropelta and Gastonia. Therizinosaurs such as Falcarius are also known from the early Cretaceous of North America.

Finally, in the long Upper Cretaceous, the greatest abundance and diversity of dinosaurs of all time lived in North America. During the early part of the Upper Cretaceous, the therizinosaur Nothronychus and the ceratopsian Zuniceratops lived. During the Campanian stage (83.672 mya), an enormous diversity of dinosaurs is known. Theropods included the tyrannosaurs Albertosaurus, Gorgosaurus, Daspletosaurus, Appalachiosaurus, and Dryptosaurus, and the dromaeosaurids Dromaeosaurus, Saurornitholestes, Atrociraptor, and Bambiraptor. Ceratopsians, such as Pachyrhinosaurus, Styracosaurus, Centrosaurus Monoclonius, Brachyceratops, Pentaceratops, and Leptoceratops also existed. Among hadrosaurs, Parasaurolophus, Corythosaurus, Lambeosaurus, Saurolophus, and Prosaurolophus existed. 

During the latest Cretaceous, the Maastrichtian stage (7265.5 mya), the diversity of dinosaurs wasn't as great as the preceding Campanian stage. North American herbivorous dinosaurs then included the titanosaur sauropod Alamosaurus, the ceratopsians Triceratops and Torosaurus, the pachycephalosaurs Pachycephalosaurus, Stygimoloch, Dracorex, and Stegoceras, the hadrosaurs Edmontosaurus and Anatotitan. Predatory dinosaurs from this time period included Tyrannosaurus and Nanotyrannus (which may just be a juvenile of the former), and the troodontid Troodon.

[[List of European dinosaurs]]

CATEGORIES: Dinosaurs of Europe, Lists of Dinosaurs, Europe-related lists

Dinosaurs evolved partway through the Triassic period of the Mesozoic era, around 230 Ma (million years ago).  At that time, the earth had one supercontinental landmass, called Pangaea, of which Europe was a part.  So it remained throughout the Triassic.  By the start of the Jurassic period, some 30 million years later, the supercontinent began to split into Laurasia and Gondwana.  The largest inlet from Panthalassa, the superocean that surrounded Pangaea, was called the Tethys Ocean, and as this inlet cut deeper into the supercontinent, much of Europe was flooded.

By the Cretaceous, from 145 to 65 million years ago, the continents were beginning to approach their present shapes, but not their present positions, and Europe remained tropical.  At times, it was a chain of island-microcontinents including Baltica and Iberia.

Europe is relatively rich in fossils from the Jurassic-Cretaceous boundary, and much of what is known about European dinosaurs dates from this time.  As the timeline below illustrates, there are substantial gaps in our knowledge from the rest of the Mesozoic.  The absence of dinosaur genera from this time is because few fossils have been discovered, and almost certainly not because Europe contained few types of dinosaur—except, perhaps, immediately after the Triassic–Jurassic extinction event.

[[Abelisaurus]]

CATEGORIES: Abelisauridae, Dinosaurs of South America, Cretaceous dinosaurs

Abelisaurus is a genus of theropod dinosaur that lived in South America during the Upper Cretaceous period. There is one known species, Abelisaurus comahuensis. 

Abelisaurus was the first abelisaurid to be discovered, and gives its name to the family, the Abelisauridae. Abelisaurus is the type genus. Despite this, little is known about it. 

The first, and only, fossils discovered were several skull bones found in Argentina. Scientists put them back together in the lab to create a skull. The skull is similar to that of other members of its family. Like most abelisaurs, it is blunt and short in length, but tall in vertical height from a front view. Abelisaurus probably preyed on the large sauropod dinosaurs of the time, such as Amargasaurus, in packs. It may also have hunted smaller plant-eating dinosaurs, such as the small ornithopod Gasparinisaura.

[[Gargoyleosaurus]]

CATEGORIES: Ankylosauria

Gargoyleosaurus ("gargoyle lizard") was an armoured ankylosaur which walked on four legs and had a stiff tail. It had a series of spikes running along each side of its body. Gargoyleosaurus was about 10 feet (3 m) long and was roughly 3.3 feet (1 m) tall to the top of the shoulder it may have weighed about a ton. 

Gargoyleosaurus is found in the  of the Morrison Formation (latest Upper Jurassic) in Wyoming. It lived about 155–144 million years ago.

[[Nanosaurus]]

CATEGORIES: Jurassic dinosaurs, Hypsilophodontidae

Nanosaurus ("small or dwarf lizard") was an ornithopod dinosaur that measured about 4 ft (1.1 m) long, weighing about 50 pounds (22.5 kg). Othnielia had a horny beak and a small skull with self-sharpening cheek teeth. Othnielia may have had cheek pouches. 

This plant eater was bipedal (walked on two legs). It had thin legs and a stiffened tail that gave it speed and agility. It had five-fingered hands and four-toed feet, all clawed. It had large eyes and short arms. Othnielia resembled Hypsilophodon. Its fossils (two partial skeletons and teeth) were found in Colorado and Utah in rocks of the Late Jurassic age. 

[[Coelurus]]

CATEGORIES: Coelurosaurs

Coelurus (meaning "hollow") is a poorly known genus. It was perhaps a bipedal theropod dinosaur 6 feet (1.8 m) long, weighing roughly 20 kg. Its femur (thigh bone) was 55 cm long. It was a carnivore that lived during the late Jurassic period, about 156 to 145 million years ago. Its bones were hollow and lightweight, so Coelurus was probably light and fast. Its fossils were found in Wyoming. Coelurus was named by paleontologist Othniel C. Marsh in 1879.

[[Commodus]]

CATEGORIES: Roman Emperors

Commodus (Lucius Aurelius Commodus Antoninus, 31 August 161 – 31 December 192) was Roman emperor from 177 to 192. He was co-emperor with his father Marcus Aurelius from 177 until his father's death in 180. From 180 to his death in 192, Commodus was the only emperor.

His accession as emperor was the first time a son had succeeded his father since Titus succeeded Vespasian in 79. Commodus was the first emperor "born to the purple", that is, born during his father's reign.

Phyllis Schlafly (August 15, 1924 in St. Louis, Missouri - September 5, 2016 in Ladue, Missouri) was an American conservative. She was a political activist, author, and constutional attorney. 

Her best-selling book, A Choice, Not an Echo, was written in 1964. The book was about corruption in the Republican Party and how people with lot of money unfairly influenced elections. She was a big supporter of Barry Goldwater, who was the Republican Party's nominee for president in 1964. Goldwater had beaten Nelson Rockefeller, a more moderate candidate backed by big money. Although Goldwater would lose the 1964 election to Lyndon Johnson, the campaign helped start the modern conservative movement. Starting in 1967, she published her own newspaper, the Phyllis Schlafly Report. When the Equal Rights Amendment was passed by congress, she organized a campaign against it. Schlafly argued that the amendment would not actually help women, often pointing out that it would force women to be drafted. After a long and controversial debate, the amendment was not added to the Constitution. Schlafly is usually considered the main force that stopped it. She is very critical of the feminist movement, saying that "it teaches women to be victims." She helped with Ronald Reagan's campaign for the presidency in 1980. Schlafly remained active in politics until her death. 

Schlafly died at the age of 92 in Ladue, Missouri of pancreatic cancer.

[[Cult of domesticity]]

CATEGORIES: Women

The cult of domesticity, also known as the cult of true womanhood, is an ideology about the roles proper for white women in the 1800s. This way of thinking promoted the ideal that wealthy white women should stay at home and should not do any work outside of the home. This ideology promoted an ideal of separate spheres, in which women remained in the home and men led out in the world. Four ideals were held up for women to aspire to:

The idea of this domesticity was practiced in 1820. However, the ideology was not recognized and truly followed until the 1840s and 1850. Some think that this domesticity came to an end only when the Civil War had ended (in 1865) due to some changes in beliefs about women's roles. 

This ideology strongly discouraged women from obtaining an education. This ideology was thought to elevate the moral status of women and benefit them in ways such as living lives of higher material comfort. It made the roles of wife and mother important in society.

[[Roe v. Wade]]

CATEGORIES: 1973, 1970s in the United States, Abortion, United States Supreme Court cases

Roe v. Wade was a 1971 - 1973 landmark decision by the US Supreme Court. The court ruled that a state law that banned abortions (To save the mother) was unconstitutional. The ruling made abortion legal in many circumstances. The decision said that a woman's right to privacy extended to the fetus/unborn child she was carrying. In the view of the court, during the first trimester an abortion was no more dangerous than carrying the fetus/child full term.  The decision was 7-2, with Chief Justice Warren E. Burger and six other Justices voting for "Jane Roe", and Justices William Rehnquist and Byron White voting against it. 

The decision divided the nation and is still controversial today. People divided into pro-life and pro-choice groups. Pro-life supporters argue that the unborn baby has the same right to life as other people, and the government should intervene to protect it. Pro-choice supporters believe that the unborn baby is not the same as a person, and the woman has the right to choose what she wants to do with her body and that the government should not intervene. Roe was limited by a later decision called Webster v. Reproductive Health (1989), which allowed regulation of abortion in some cases.  Several states have considered  laws banning abortions altogether.

The Moral Majority was a political organization in the United States. It was made by Jerry Falwell. It tried to get conservative Christian views into laws by lobbying.  It was one of the major organizations of the religious right. It was started in 1979, in response to Roe v. Wade and other events known as the "culture wars". It broke up in the late 1980s. It had four branches:

It broke up during Ronald Reagan's presidency because people did not think that the matter was so urgent. Other Christians also opposed it, as well as many liberal people.

[[Archimedes' principle]]

CATEGORIES: Physics, Experiments, Archimedes

Archimedes' principle is named after Archimedes of Syracuse, the first to discover this law. When he did, he ran naked out of his bathtub. Archimedes' principle relates buoyancy to displacement.

[[Theoretical particle]]

CATEGORIES: Elementary particles

Theoretical particles are particles that have been assumed or predicted to exist by scientists, but have not been proven in any experiment. Some, like the tachyon, probably don't exist, since they violate several laws of physics. However, many are still believed to exist.  All supersymmetric particles (such as a sfermion) are theoretical. Supersymmetrical particles are often abbreviated with an "s" in front of the particle name, like a sfermion. Particles found in antimatter are not theoretical particles because they have been found in numerous experiments.

[[Supersymmetry]]

CATEGORIES: Cosmology, Quantum mechanics, String theory

Supersymmetry is a scientific theory that says that when elementary particles (such as photons, electrons, and quarks) were formed at the beginning of the universe, matching kinds of theoretical "superparticles" were also created. If this theory is true, it would at least double the kinds of particles in the universe. If the universe has extra dimensions (M-Theory by Edward Witten predicts up to 11) then there would also be more ways to have symmetry and more kinds of superparticles.

Many scientists hope to prove supersymmetry because it fills many gaps in the Standard Model of physics (including dark matter) and would give support to the ideas of string theory. However, experiments in the Large Hadron Collider have not found evidence of supersymmetry so far.

Supersymmetry was the idea of Hironari Miyazawa (b. 1927).

[[Antihydrogen]]

CATEGORIES: Antimatter, Hydrogen, Gases

Antihydrogen is an atom made of antimatter. Like normal matter, antihydrogen can bond and form molecules with other antimatter. (It would annihilate any normal matter that it touches). Antihydrogen has one positron–which is positively charged–orbiting an antiproton, which is negatively charged. This is opposite normal hydrogen, which has one negatively charged electron orbiting a positively charged proton.

"Antihydrogen" can also refer to the molecule called Antihydrogen, which is made of two bonded antiprotons.

[[Antiproton]]

CATEGORIES: Subatomic particles, Antimatter

Antiprotons are tiny particles of antimatter. They have a negative charge, and are the nucleus of an Antihydrogen atom. They are not theoretical, as they have been found in scientific studies. When they come in contact with regular protons, each are annihilated and a relatively massive amount of energy is generated.

Actually, antiproton is a subatomic particle of the same mass as a proton but having a negative electric chargeand oppositely directed magnetic moment. It is the proton’s antiparticle. Antiprotons were first produced and identified in 1955 by Emilio Segrè, Owen Chamberlain (for which they received the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1959), and coworkers by bombarding a copper target with high-energy protons from the proton synchrotron at the University of California at Berkeley. Antiprotons were predicted in the early 1930s, but their discovery had to wait for the technology of high-energy particle accelerators to reach the 6 billion electron-volt range. A collision of an antiproton with a proton results in mutual annihilation, but a near miss may produce by charge exchange an antineutron–neutron pair.

[[Leptoceratops]]

CATEGORIES: Cretaceous dinosaurs, Ceratopsids

Leptoceratops (meaning "slender horned face") was a stocky ceratopsian dinosaur that had a large skull are there was a horn on its beaked snout. It is known from five skulls and some skeletal material. Leptoceratops are during in the Upper Cretaceous, about 6865 million years ago. Fossils have been found in Alberta, Canada, and Wyoming, in North America.

[[Montanoceratops]]

CATEGORIES: Cretaceous dinosaurs, Ceratopsids

Montanoceratops (meaning "Montana horned face") was a ceratopsian dinosaur, walked on four legs, had a large head, a bulky body, a parrot-like beak, a small nose horn, cheek teeth, and a small frill on its head. Males may have had larger frills than females, indicating that the frill may have been used in courtship and mating.

[[Archelon]]

CATEGORIES: Turtles, Marine reptiles

Archelon was a huge marine turtle (Testudines) that was the size of a car. It lived in North America 74 million years ago (from the Upper Cretaceous) in the epeiric inland sea called the Western Interior Seaway. Fossils have been found in the U.S. states of Kansas and South Dakota. 

This carnivore was up to 4.6 long. It had a wide, flattened shell, paddle-like legs, a long, narrow head, weak jaws, and a short, pointed tail. Its only predators were probably the larger mosasaurs. From its beak, its own food was probably squid.

Archelon, like other turtles, had a solidly-roofed skull with no opening (except for eyes, and nostrils). 

[[Atlantic sturgeon]]

CATEGORIES: Bony fish, Edible fish

The Atlantic sturgeon (Acipenser sturio) is a member of the Acipenseridae family. It is one of the oldest fish species in the world. It can be found from New Brunswick, Canada to the eastern coast of Florida. The numbers of Atlantic sturgeon have fallen because of overfishing and water pollution. It is considered threatened, endangered and even extinct in much of its original habitats. The fish live to 60 years of age, 15 feet in length and over 800 pounds in weight.

[[Quantum fluctuation]]

CATEGORIES: Quantum mechanics

A quantum fluctuation is the temporary change in the amount of energy in a point in space, as explained in Werner Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. It applies only to quantum physics. 

That means that conservation of energy can seem to be violated, but only to allow the creation of virtual particle-antiparticle pairs for exceedingly short period of time.    Like normal matter and antimatter, theoretical electrons and positrons annihilate each other. Unlike normal matter, however, they do not create any energy when they annihilate each other, but instead create an imaginary photon. Normal photons can interact with matter, but theoretical photons do not.

[[Critical error]]

A critical error is an error which the OS cannot reasonably ignore so as to respond again. The critical error is often linked with a BSOD. These errors are known also as system failure. However, not all types of OS failure are critical errors. Freezing or deadlock are NOT usually considered critical. Critical errors can lead to error avalanches also.

[[Septimius Severus]]

CATEGORIES: 145 births, 211 deaths, Roman Emperors

Septimius Severus (Lucius Septimius Severus, 11 April 145 AD – 4 February 211) was Roman Emperor from 193 AD to 211. Severus was born in Leptis Magna in the province of Africa. Severus was an born an African, and some portraits show him as such. In 187 he married Julia Domna, from Syria.

As a young man, Severus advanced under the reigns of Marcus Aurelius and Commodus. Severus seized power after the death of Emperor Pertinax in 193 during the so-called Year of the Five Emperors. After deposing the incumbent emperor Didius Julianus in a bloodless coup, Severus fought his rival claimants, the generals Pescennius Niger and Clodius Albinus. Niger was defeated in 194 at the Battle of Issus, and Albinus three years later at the Battle of Lugdunum. 

After solidifying his rule, Severus waged a brief war against the Parthian Empire, sacking their capital Ctesiphon in 197. In 202 he campaigned  in Africa against the Garamantes, briefly taking their capital Garama and expanding the southern frontier of the empire radically. 

Late in his reign he fought the Picts in Caledonia and strengthened Hadrian's Wall in Britain. Severus died in 211 at Eboracum, succeeded by his sons Caracalla and Geta. With the succession of his sons, Severus founded the Severan dynasty, the last dynasty of the empire before the Crisis of the Third Century.

[[Amphetamine]]

CATEGORIES: Drugs

Amphetamine is a synthetic drug. The drug is a stimulant: it can help people keep the focus and stay awake. It also decreases appetite and fatigue. Chemically, it is similar to methamphetamine. These drugs increase the level of dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain, which can create euphoria. The class of drugs containing amphetamine includes prescription drugs commonly used to treat attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It is also used to treat symptoms of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and the daytime drowsiness symptoms of narcolepsy, amongst others. Initially, amphetamine was more popularly used to reduce appetite and to control weight.

Sometimes, the drug is used for fun or to boost performance.  Many different names are used for amphetamines.  They include Benzedrine and speed.  The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction reports the typical retail price of amphetamine in Europe varied between €3 and €15 ($4 to $21.55 USD) a gram in half of the reporting countries. The name amphetamine is derived from its chemical name: alpha-methylphenethylamine.

[[Computer freezing]]

CATEGORIES: Computers

Many modern computers have operating systems that permit several applications or programs to run at the same time. Each running program uses one or more so-called processes, that's why this situation is generally known as multiprocessing. At times it can happen, that a process stops responding to user input; the user sees when the computer stops responding to inputs, or it becomes very slow. Different causes can cause this scenario: The  most frequent are deadlock, race conditions or the system simply having too much to do. In many cases, the only solution is to terminate the processes, which cause so much load. Many GUI-based operating systems have programs that allow the user to tell the operating system to terminate a process. There may also be command-line programs that do this. When the operating system terminates a process, all unsaved data of the process will be lost.

In the case where the operating system detects such a situation, it may show a BSoD. 

[[8 track tape]]

CATEGORIES: Magnetic tape

The 8-track is a music format which first appeared in the 1960s. It is a tape format which was created so people could play music in their cars. Unlike cassettes, 8 tracks are a continuous loop of tape. They did not need to be turned over to keep playing. There were four programs of music on each tape with two tracks on each program to create stereo sound. When the track was over, a very thin piece of metal in the tape would be sensed. This would cause the part of the player that read the tape (the head) to start reading the next track. 8 tracks became very popular in the early 1970s. They were used both in the home and car.

In the 1970s, the cassette tape was improved. It eventually had better quality than 8-tracks. By the late 1970s, cassettes became more popular than 8-tracks. In 1980, 8-tracks were rarely being made. They could still be bought through mail order record clubs until 1987. Today there are still a small number of people who collect 8 tracks.

[[Sinornithosaurus]]

CATEGORIES: Dromaeosauridae, Feathered dinosaurs

Sinornithosaurus (derived from Latin and Greek, meaning 'Chinese bird-lizard') was a feathered dinosaur from the Lower Cretaceous, a dromaeosaur. It was found in the Yixian Formation in what is now China.

This new fossil supports the idea that these dinosaurs did not have scaly, reptile-like skin, but had a softer, downy coat. No fossil skin impressions of these dinosaurs had been found previously.

[[Sinosauropteryx]]

CATEGORIES: Cretaceous dinosaurs, Coelurosaurs, Feathered dinosaurs

Sinosauropteryx 

is a genus of non-avialan dinosaur (not a bird). 

It is the first one found with the fossilized impressions of furry down or filamentous feathers. Overall, the filaments resemble the down-like feathers of some modern flightless birds.

Sinosauropteryx lived in China during the early Cretaceous period and was a close relative of Compsognathus. It has been dated to 124.6–122 million years ago.

The fossils were from the famous Jehol biota of Sihetun, Liaoning Province, China, and represent an ancient lake bed. 

Most paleontologists do not consider Sinosauropteryx to be a bird, because phylogenetically, it lies far from the clade Aves, usually defined as Archaeopteryx plus modern birds. 

Sinosauropteryx prima is among the smallest known non-avian theropods, with the type specimen (a nearly mature individual) measuring only 68 in length, including a very long tail.

[[Unenlagia]]

CATEGORIES: Dromaeosauridae

Unenlagia was a theropod from the mid-Cretaceous, living about 90 million years ago. The first birds appeared 150 million years ago, evolving from dinosaurs long before Unenlagia lived. Therefore, it is not an ancestor of modern-day birds, but was an evolutionary dead-end. The most bird-like dinosaur ever discovered is the 90-million-year-old Unenlagia comahuensis, a flightless, 4-foot tall, 7.5-foot-long carnivore.

[[Severan dynasty]]

CATEGORIES: Roman Emperors

The Severan dynasty was a Roman imperial dynasty, which ruled the Roman Empire between 193 and 235. The dynasty was founded by the Roman general Septimius Severus, who rose to power during the civil war of 193, known as the Year of the Five Emperors.

Although Septimius Severus successfully restored peace following the upheaval of the late 2nd century, the dynasty was disturbed by unstable family relationships, and constant political turmoil. It foreshadowed the coming Crisis of the Third Century. It was the last lineage of the Principate founded by Augustus.

[[Crisis of the Third Century]]

CATEGORIES: Roman Emperors

The Crisis of the Third Century (235–284 AD) was a period in which the Roman Empire almost collapsed. There were invasions, civil war, plague, and the economy collapsed. The crisis is sometimes called the "Military Anarchy" or "Imperial Crisis". 

The crisis began with the assassination of Emperor Alexander Severus at the hands of his own troops in 235 AD. This started a fifty-year period in which 20–25 rivals struggled for the throne. Most were important Roman Army generals who took control over all or part of the Empire. 

By 258–260, the Empire had split into three competing states. There was the Gallic Empire, which included the Roman provinces of Gaul, Britannia and Hispania, and the Palmyrene Empire, with the eastern provinces of Syria Palaestina and Aegyptus. These became independent of the Italian Roman Empire proper, which stood between them. The crisis ended with the ascension of Diocletian in 284.

The crisis resulted in many changes to the Empire's institutions, society, economic life and, eventually, religion. It was a transition period between  classical antiquity and late antiquity.

[[Ecumenism]]

CATEGORIES: Church organization, Christian movements and denominational families

Ecumenism (or Oecumenism) is the idea that the different Christian denominations should work together more than they currently do. This idea is different from religious toleration. Over the years, Christianity has been split into many different movements. These separations are based on doctrine, on history, and what people do in everyday life. 

The term ecumenical comes from the Latin oecumenicus, a phrase referring to "the whole world", meaning literally "inhabited" (lived in). In Christianity the qualification ecumenical is originally (and still) used in terms such as Ecumenical council and Ecumenical patriarch. The meaning pertains to the totality of the larger Church (such as the Catholic Church or the Orthodox Church). It is not restricted to one of its local churches or dioceses.

[[New South Greenland]]

CATEGORIES: Exploration, Antarctica, Phantom islands, 1823

New South Greenland, which is also known as Morrell's Land, was an appearance of land recorded by the American captain Benjamin Morrell.  Morrel reported the sighting on the schooner Wasp in March 1823, during a seal hunting and exploration voyage in the Weddell Sea area of Antarctica. He provided precise coordinates and a description of a coastline. Morrel claimed to have sailed along the coastline for more than 300. The Weddel Sea is in the Antarctic. Because of icebergs, it was difficult to navigate, and few people did. The sighting was never investigated properly, at the time. Expeditions to Antarctica in the early 20th century proved that there was no land at the positions recorded by Morrell.

At the time of Morrell's voyage the Weddel Sea had not been named and its geography and coastline was almost entirely unknown. This made the sighting plausible at the start. Morrell made obvious errors when he told about the new sighting. He also had the reputation of liking to invent new stories. These two aspects made many people sceptical about the sighting. In June 1912 the German explorer Wilhelm Filchner's ship Deutschland was blocked by ice in the Weddel Sea and drifted into the area, where Morrell had reported the new land. Filchcher searched for the land, but found no trace of it. A sounding of the sea bottom revealed more than 5000 of water, indicating no land nearby. Three years later, trapped in the same waters with his ship Endurance, Ernest Shackleton was able by similar means to confirm the land's non-existence.

Different explanations for Morell's error have been suggested. One of them is that Morrell wanted to deceive with this claimed finding. Morrell describes his sighting briefly, and seeks no personal credit or glory from the discovery. In his narrative, he gives all credit to his fellow sealing captain, Robert Johnson, for finding and naming the land two years earlier. Morrell may have been honestly mistaken, through miscalculation of his ship's position or by misremembering detail when writing the account after nine years. Alternatively, he may have made the common error of confusing distant icebergs with land, or been misled by the distorting effects of Antarctic mirage.  In 1843 the distinguished British naval explorer James Clark Ross reported possible land in a position close to Morrell's; this land, too, would eventually be proven not to exist.

James Martin Pacelli McGuinness (23 May 1950 – 21 March 2017)  was a Northern Irish politician who was the Deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland until his resignation on 9 January 2017. He was born in Derry, Northern Ireland. He was a member of Sinn Fein, which is a political party that wants Northern Ireland to join with the Republic of Ireland and leave the United Kingdom. He was the Member of Parliament and Member of the Northern Ireland Assembly for the constituency of Mid Ulster.

Martin McGuiness joined the Irish Republican Army (IRA) in 1970 and was put in prison for six months in 1973. He was elected the Member of Parliament for Mid-Ulster at the 1997 General Election but never took his seat in the House of Commons. This is because Sinn Fein members do not want to swear any oath to the Queen. 

McGuiness was one of Sinn Fein's top debaters at the Good Friday Agreement of 1998 and was elected as a Member of the Northern Ireland Assembly in 1998 for the constituency of Mid Ulster. He was the Minister of Education in the Northern Ireland executive from 1999 to 2002. On 8 May 2007, following the St. Andrew's Agreement Martin McGuiness was made the Deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland. Ian Paisley of the Democratic Unionist Party was the First Minister until June 5, 2008 when he was replaced by Peter Robinson.

In January 2017, it was revealed that McGuinness was suffering from amyloidosis, a rare genetic disease that affects the vital organs. He died in a hospital in Londonderry  on 21 March 2017 from the disease, aged 66.

[[Latin honours]]

CATEGORIES: Qualifications, Education, Latin phrases

Latin honours are Latin phrases that are used to show how advanced the level at which someone earned an academic degree. The common ranks are: cum laude (meaning "with honor"), magna cum laude ("with great honor"), or summa cum laude ("with highest honor"). This system is mostly used in Canada, the United States, and in many European countries. Some universities in other countries also use the English translation of these phrases rather than the Latin ones.

Another example is egregia cum laude, which means "with outstanding honor" in English. The egregia rank was created to recognize students who earned the same grade point average as the summa honor, but who did so while in a more rigorous honors curriculum (used by the College of St. Benedict and St. John's University).

Michael Denzil Xavier Portillo (born 26 May 1953) is a British television presenter and former Conservative Party politician. 

Michael Portillo was born in Bushey, Hertfordshire, to a Scottish mother and Spanish father.

Portillo first became a Member of Parliament (MP) in a by-election in 1984, representing the constituency of Enfield Southgate. He very much liked Margaret Thatchers policies and was quite Eurosceptic, meaning that he was against the European Union. He became a cabinet member in 1992, holding the following positions: Chief Secretary to the Treasury (April 1992 - July 1994), Secretary of State for Employment (July 1994 - July 1995) and Defence Secretary (July 1995 - May 1997).

At the 1997 General Election, Portillo lost his seat in the House of Commons to the Labour Party.

Portillo returned to the House of Commons after winning a by-election in 1999 for the constituency of Kensington and Chelsea. He then started to re-think many of his ideas and began to argue for a more socially liberal Conservative Party. He became the Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer in February 2000 but he did not have a good relationship with party leader William Hague. He was a candidate in the 2001 Conservative Party leadership contest; he lost to Iain Duncan Smith. Portillo left the House of Commons at the 2005 General Election and has since hosted several television and radio programmes.

[[Carl-Henning Pedersen]]

CATEGORIES: 1913 births, 2007 deaths, Danish painters, People from Copenhagen

Carl-Henning Pedersen (23 September 1913 – 20 February 2007) was a Danish painter and a key member of the COBRA movement which existed from 1948 to 1951.  He was known as the "Scandinavian Chagall", and was one of the leading Danish artists of the second half of the 20th century.

Pedersen was born in Copenhagen and brought up in the poor area near Vigerslev Alle.  He held radical political beliefs.  He joined the International Folk High School in Elsinore in 1933, where he met self-taught painter Else Alfelt.  They married in 1934, and their first daughter, Vibeke Alfelt, was born later that year. Else Alfelt encouraged Pedersen to paint, and he first exhibited at the Artists' Autumn Exhibition (Kunstnernes Efterårsudstilling) in Copenhagen in 1936, where he showed four abstract works.  His modernist style was at odds with the socialist realism preferred by his communist friends, who snubbed him: he argued with Bertolt Brecht about his art. His abstract works, with flat planes of colour, emulated the works of cubists and of Paul Klee.

Pedersen travelled on foot to Paris in 1939, where he saw works by Picasso and Matisse. He visited the exhibition of "degenerate art" (entartete Kunst) in Frankfurt am Main on his way home, where he was inspired by the paintings on show, particularly the works of Chagall, which remained a strong influence on his art for the rest of his life.  His second daughter, Kari-Nina, was born in 1940.  He joined the Høst group during the Nazi occupation of Denmark, writing about medieval Danish murals for its journal, Helhesten, and continued to produce controversial modern abstract works.  

Pedersen and Else Alfelt were founder members of the CoBrA movement in 1948 together with Asger Jorn, Karel Appel and others.  The movement took its name from the European cities where its founders were based: Copenhagen, Brussels and Amsterdam.  They remained with the group until it dissolved in 1951, producing free-form, spontaneous images in strong, fantastic colours.  He won the Eckersberg Award in 1950 and the Guggenheim Award in 1958.  A retrospective was put on at the Carnegie Institute in Pittsburgh in 1961, and he was Denmark's representative at the Venice Biennale in 1962.  He won the Thorvaldsen Medal in 1963.

Pedersen moved into monumental art in the 1960s and 1970s, producing a large mosaic, "Cosmic Sea", for the H. C. Ørsted Institute at Copenhagen University, and a huge tiled wall decoration, "Fantasy Play Around the Wheel of Life", for the Angli courtyard in Herning.

Pedersen was known for resisting to sell his works. Instead, he donated thousands to the Carl-Henning Pedersen and Else Alfelt Museum, which opened in Herning in 1976. Further works were donated to the Danish National Gallery (Statens Museum for Kunst) in early 2007.

Pedersen moved to Burgundy in the 1980s, but most of his work still came from Danish sources.  He surprised many when he worked on the redecoration of the Gothic cathedral in Ribe, working on the murals, painted glass and mosaics to illustrate Bible stories from 1983 to 1987.  He also produced bronze sculptures, and works in oils and watercolour.

He died in Copenhagen, after a long illness.  He was survived by his second wife, Sidsel Ramson.

[[Roman Senate]]

CATEGORIES: Ancient Rome

The Roman Senate was the longest-lasting institution in Ancient Rome. It began in the first years of the city, which was supposedly founded in 753 BC. It survived the kings, the Roman Republic (509 BC–27 BC), the Roman Empire (27 BC–395 AD and the fall of the Western Roman Empire (395–476 AD).

The Senate started as an advisory council of elders. The word "senate" came from 'senex' meaning "old man". The Senate reached its peak in the middle Republic, when it was the most powerful body in Rome.  The Senate lost much of its power in the first period of the Empire, known as the Principate.

After Diocletian, when the centre of government was moved out of Rome, the Senate became just a municipal body. The influence of the old idea lived on, and Constantine II set up a Senate in Constantinople.

[[Spiraeoideae]]

CATEGORIES: Rosaceae

The Spiraeoideae is an old name for a subfamily of flowering plants in the family Rosaceae. Until 2007, the subfamily name was used for a group of plants that are mostly shrubs (but some are herbs) and have small dry fruit. In 2007, the subfamily was made much larger, to include plants that were previously placed in subfamilies Amygdaloideae and Maloideae. In 2012, it was decided at the International Botanical Congress that the correct name for that large subfamily must be Amygdaloideae. Subfamily Amygdaloideae now includes plants with fleshy fruit including apple and plum.

[[Analytical chemistry]]

CATEGORIES: Analytical chemistry

Analytical chemistry is a branch of chemistry. It tries to analyze chemicals in things. A simple job would be to see how much zinc is in a piece of brass. There are several methods, like chromatography and mass spectrometry to do this. Flame tests can be used for a basic analysis.

More formally: it is the study of the chemical components of natural and artificial materials.

Qualitative analysis finds what chemical species are in the sample. Quantitative analysis finds out how much of a substance there are in a sample. Substances in a sample are often separated from each other using chromatography before the analysis. This is because a sample can contain many different substances.

[[Mussaurus]]

CATEGORIES: Prosauropods

Mussaurus (meaning "mouse lizard") was an early, plant-eating prosauropod dinosaur from the Upper Triassic, about 215 million years ago.  It was found in southern Argentina. It gets its name from the small size of the skeletons first discovered.

They were large-eyed hatchlings (babies), only 9-16 inches long (18-37 cm); these are the smallest dinosaur skeletons yet found.

However, Mussaurus is now known from adult specimens. the name is something of a misnomer; adults possibly reached 3 m (10 ft) in length, and weighed 70. Mussaurus possesses anatomical features suggesting a close, possibly transitional evolutionary relationship with true sauropods.

[[Afrovenator]]

CATEGORIES: Dinosaurs of Africa, Megalosauridae

Afrovenator was a theropod dinosaur from the  Middle Jurassic of northern Africa. It was a bipedal meat-eating predator with long bladelike teeth.  Fossils have been found in Abaka, Niger in the southern Sahara desert. A nearly complete Afrovenator was found in 1993. It is one of the most complete dinosaurs found in Africa so far. 

The rocks where it was found were redescribed as "mid-Jurassic" after the discovery had been announced.

It is in a group of theropods which are known as the Megalosaurs.

[[Delisle scale]]

CATEGORIES: Units of temperature

The Delisle scale is a scale to measure temperature. It was introduced by French astronomer Joseph-Nicolas Delisle in 1732. Delisle used a thermometer that worked with Mercury. The unit is abbreviated "De" or "D". 0°De is equal to the boiling point of water under normal pressure. Delisle then measured the volume change of the mercury. At the start, the Delisle scale had 2400 degrees. Josias Weitbrecht recalibrated the theromometer in 1738, so that the melting point of ice was taken into account. Ice melts at 150°De. 

The Deslile scale counts downwards, from the boiling point to the melting point. It was widely used in Russia in the 19th century.

[[Roman Kingdom]]

CATEGORIES: Ancient Rome

The Roman Kingdom (Regnum Romanum) was the monarchical government of the city of Rome and its territories. No written records from that time survive. The histories about it were written during the Republic and Empire and are largely based on legend. Therefore, not much is certain about the history of the Roman Kingdom.

However, the history of the Roman Kingdom began with the city's founding, traditionally dated to 753 BC, and ended with the overthrow of the kings and the establishment of the Republic in about 509 BC.

[[Hypobromite]]

CATEGORIES: Bromine compounds

Hypobromite is an ion. Its chemical formula is BrO-. It contains bromine in its +1 oxidation state. It is an oxidizing agent. It is similar to hypochlorite. Hypobromites are the salts of hypobromous acid. Hypobromite is a disinfectant. Some white blood cells oxidize bromide to hypobromite with peroxide and use the hypobromite to kill germs. Bromides can be added to pools along with chlorine to make hypobromite, which disinfects the pools.

Hypobromites are made by dissolving bromine in a basic solution. Hypobromite disproportionates to bromate and bromide when heated.

[[Hypobromous acid]]

CATEGORIES: Acids, Bromine compounds

Hypobromous acid is a chemical compound. It is also an acid. Its chemical formula is HBrO. It contains hydrogen and hypobromite ions. It is a weak and unstable acid. It is similar to hypochlorous acid. It disproportionates into bromate and bromide when heated or left to dry. It is made when bromine is added to warm water. It can kill many bacteria and deodorize. It works very well when it is with hypochlorous acid.

[[Köhler's Medizinal-Pflanzen]]

CATEGORIES: Medical manuals, Botany

Köhler's Medizinal-Pflanzen is the German title of “the medicinal plants of Kohler” - the atlas of medicinal plants with the illustrations and the brief explanations, one of the most known reference books on the medicinal plants of the end of the 19th Century.

Complete title of atlas in the German language - “Köhler's Medizinal-Pflanzen naturgetreuen Abbildungen mit kurz erläuterndem Texte. Atlas zur pharmacopoea germanica, austriaca, belgica, danica, helvetica, hungarica, rossica, suecica, Neerlandica, British pharmacopoeia, zum Codex medicamentarius, sowie zur Pharmacopoeia of the United States of America”.

The three-volume publication was published by the publishing house Franz Kohler (Ger. Franz Eugen Köhler) “Gera-Untermhaus” at Gero in 1887.

In three volumes of atlas containing a four hundred colored botanical illustrations of medicinal plants. Together with the images of plants, the atlas includes detailed botanical descriptions and information about the medical effectiveness of these plants (Herbalism). High-quality chromolithographies accurately transfer to the component of plants and reflect the characteristic features of the corresponding forms. It is considered that this book - better meets the botanical illustrations of medicinal plants.

The publisher of reference book Franz Koehler was not the author or the illustrator of this work. Artist- illustrators - Müeller C.F. Schmidt, lithograph - K. Gunther. The first two volumes of publication were prepared with the participation of German botanist Gustav Pabst.

The fourth volume, initially outlined for the release, never was published. Later in the USA was published the analogous book, they sometimes identify it with the fourth volume.

[[Suprematism]]

CATEGORIES: Art movements, Architecture

Suprematism is an abstract art movement started in Russia, 1915/1916. It focussed on basic geometric forms such as the square and circle. It is an example of geometric abstraction.

Suprematism was founded by Kazimir Malevich. In his book The Non-Objective World, published abroad as a Bauhaus Book in 1927, Malevich described the inspiration which brought about the powerful image of the black square on a white ground:

He created a suprematist 'grammar' based on fundamental geometric forms; in particular, the square and the circle. In 1915, Malevich exhibited his early experiments in suprematist painting. The centerpiece of his show was the Black Square, placed in what is called the red/beautiful corner in Russian Orthodox tradition, the place of the main icon in a house. "Black Square" was painted in 1915 and was a breakthrough in his career and in art in general. Malevich also painted White on White which marked a breakthrough from polychrome to monochrome suprematism.

Some of the titles to paintings in 1915 express the concept of a non-euclidean geometry which imagined forms in movement, or through time; titles such as: Two dimensional painted masses in the state of movement.

Kazimir Malevich  (Kiev, 23 February 1879 – 15 May 1935) was a Russian painter and art theoretician. He was born in Ukraine of ethnic Polish parents. who settled near Kiev in Kiev Governorate of the Russian Empire during the partitions of Poland. He was a pioneer of geometric abstract art and the originator of the avant-garde Suprematism movement.

In March 1913 a major exhibition of Aristarkh Lentulov's paintings opened in Moscow. The effect of this exhibition was comparable with that of Paul Cézanne in Paris in 1907, as all the main Russian avant-garde artists of the time (including Malevich) immediately absorbed the cubist principles and began using them in their works. 

Already in the same year the Cubo-Futurist opera Victory Over the Sun with Malevich's stage-set became a great success. In 1914 Malevich exhibited his works in the Salon des Independants in Paris.

[[Evil empire]]

CATEGORIES: 1980s in the Soviet Union, Speeches by Ronald Reagan, Political slogans, 1980s in the United States

The "Evil Empire" is a term which was used by the US president Ronald Reagan (1911-2004). It is a synonym for the Soviet Empire, which consists of the "republics" of the Soviet Union and the "Council for Mutual Economic Assistance" (Comecon). Members of this "council" were satellite states, which where formally independent, but always controlled into the right direction by the Soviet Union with military, if they considered it as necessary.

The first known usage of the term "Evil Empire" was in one of Reagan's speeches at 1983. He proposes to continue the endless war between good and evil. This emphasizes that you need both sides to agree for an nuclear freeze. If only the US reduced their nuclear weapons, it "would be a very dangerous fraud, for that is merely the illusion of peace". In contrast to this illusion he stands for the reality. This means for him "peace through strength".

[[Containment]]

CATEGORIES: History of the Soviet Union, History of the United States

The policy of containment was a diplomatic strategy of the United States to prevent the spread of the communism during the Cold War. Economic support should bind countries to the United States. This was a counteraction against the new Soviet sphere of influence.

In March 1947 the US president Harry Truman (1884-1972) announced support for countries which were threatened by military force. This speech is called "Truman Doctrine" nowadays. In detail, he promised support for Greece and Turkey against the Soviet Union.

The most important part of the policy of containment was the "European Recovery Program" (1948), also known as "Marshall Plan", which should boost the European economy after the destruction in the Second World War using—most important—money, successful American economic models, and less European trade barriers.

[[Araucaria]]

CATEGORIES: Conifers, Living fossils, Fossil plants

Araucaria is a genus of evergreen coniferous trees in the family Araucariaceae. There are 19 species in the genus, with a scattered distribution. They are found in New Caledonia (where 13 species are endemic), Norfolk Island, eastern Australia, New Guinea, Argentina, Chile, and southern Brazil.

The present populations are relicts, and of restricted distribution. They are found in forest and shrubland, in exposed sites. These tall trees are living fossils, dating back to early in the Mesozoic era. 

Fossil records show that the genus also formerly occurred in the northern hemisphere until the end of the Cretaceous period. By far the greatest diversity exists in New Caledonia, due to the island's long isolation and stability.

[[Safe mode]]

CATEGORIES: Computers

Safe mode is a mode of startup in computers that allows the user to detect and fix errors. Many things do not run on safe mode. The reason is to see whether any of the recently added or updated device drivers were causing the problem.

When safe mode is used, a computer will only start with the minimum number of system files needed for it to work properly. This is to make it easier to find a problem that may be causing a computer to work incorrectly. The screen resolution is also smaller and there is no sound or internet connection in safe mode. This is because these features are not necessary for the computer to work properly.

[[Tammar wallaby]]

CATEGORIES: Macropods, Marsupials of Australia

The tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii) are a small species of wallaby from Australia. They were the first macropods to be seen by Europeans. Francisco Pelsaert, captain of the Batavia, saw them when the ship was wrecked on the Abrolhos Islands in 1629. He said they looked like hopping cats. There are three sub-species of tammar wallaby:

The name tammar comes from the word tamma, meaning sheoak. The wallaby lives under sheoak plants.

Tammar wallabies became extinct on mainland South Australia in the 1930's.  Extinction has been caused by habitat destruction, hunting, and foxes.  In 1998 a small population of South Australian wallabies was found living on Kawau Island near Auckland, in New Zealand. This group had been established by former South Australian governor, Sir George Grey in 1862 as part of his own private zoo. In New Zealand these wallabies were seen as a pest, and scientists have been studying ways to get rid of them. 85 wallabies were taken back to South Australia. After extensive fox controls at Innes National Park, 10 wallabies were released in November 2004. Another 36 were released in June 2005. These first releases were tracked with radio collars. Another group has been put into a captive breeding program at Monarto Zoo.

Tammar wallabies live in thick scrub during the day and come out into grassland to feed at night. They eat mainly grass and herbs. In dry areas they have been known to survive by drinking seawater. They range over an area of about 5.

They are about 50 in height, with a dark grey brown fur. They have reddish colour on their arms and sides, with pale grey fur on their bellies. They may also have a feint white line on their cheeks.

The wallabies have a very unusual breeding pattern. The fertilized eggs remain dormant inside the mother until the summer solstice when foetal development restarts. This is called "embryonic diapause". All the young are born on the same day about 31 days later, at the end of January or the beginning of February.

The tammar wallaby is the marsupial chosen for the genome sequencing project. Scientists are studying the milk from the wallaby as they think it might contain a new and powerful antibiotic.

[[Antonine Wall]]

CATEGORIES: Buildings and structures in Ancient Rome, History of the United Kingdom, World Heritage Sites in the United Kingdom, Defensive walls

The Antonine Wall is a stone and turf fortification built across northern Great Britain by the Roman Empire in the middle 2nd century. The Roman emperor Antoninus Pius built the wall to control barbarians: the ancient Britons to the north of the wall, in Caledonia. The wall is now in Scotland, and runs between the Firth of Forth and the Firth of Clyde in the modern Scottish Lowlands. When the Romans built the wall, it was the northern border of the Roman Empire.

The Roman legions (armies) of the governor of Roman Britain, Lollius Urbicus, built the wall for the emperor between 139 and 142. The wall was about 59 long. Its foundations were made of stone and was between 4.5 and 5 wide. The wall itself was made of turf. In front of the wall (on the northern side) was a ditch. The ditch was 7 away from the wall. The ditch was at least 3.6 deep and was nearly 12 wide in places. The Romans used the wall until after 158. The last Romans went away from the wall in around 163. After that, the wall fell into ruins slowly.

The Antonine Wall is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site called Frontiers of the Roman Empire. It shares this listing with Hadrian's Wall in England and the German fortifications known as the Limes Germanicus. The barrier was the second of two "great walls" created by the Romans in Great Britain. Its ruins are less visible than the better known Hadrian's Wall to the south.

Construction began in AD 142 at the order of emperor Antoninus Pius, and took about twelve years to complete. Pressure from the Caledonians may have led Antoninus Pius to send the empire's troops farther north. The wall was protected by sixteen forts with a number of small fortlets between them; troop movement was facilitated by a road linking all the sites known as the Military Way. The soldiers who built the wall commemorated the construction and their struggles with the barbarians in a number of decorative slabs, twenty of which still survive.

Despite this good start, the wall was abandoned after only twenty years. The garrisons were sent back to Hadrian's Wall. In 208 the emperor Septimius Severus re-established legions at the wall and ordered repairs. This has led to the wall being referred to as the Severan Wall. However, this occupation ended only a few years later, and the wall was never fortified again. Most of the wall and its associated fortifications have been destroyed over time, but some remains are still visible. Many of these have come under the care of Historic Scotland and the UNESCO World Heritage Site Committee. Most of the wall is private property.

[[Ermine Street]]

CATEGORIES: Roman roads in Britain

Ermine Street is the name of one of the main Roman roads in Britain. It ran from London (Londinium) to Lincoln (Lindum Colonia) and York (Eboracum). The original Roman name for the road is not known. 

Ermine Street is also called the Old North Road from London to where it joins the A1 near Godmanchester.

The alternative route (in blue) was built to allow transport in all weather. The direct route crosses the River Humber, a tidal estuary of the rivers Trent and Ouse. In bad weather crossing would have been impossible. The Humber is too wide for the Romans to have built a bridge, therefore some kind of ferry must have been used.

[[Fosse Way]]

CATEGORIES: Roman roads in Britain

Fosse Way was one of the main Roman roads in Britain. Its route was unusual, because despite its length it went nowhere near London. It went directly from the south-west coast to the midland east coast. It linked Exeter (Isca Dumnoniorum) in South West England to Lincoln (Lindum Colonia) in the East Midlands. The road went via Ilchester (Lindinis), Bath (Aquae Sulis), Cirencester (Corinium) and Leicester (Ratae Corieltauvorum).

It joined Akeman Street and Ermin Way at Cirencester, crossed Watling Street at Venonis (High Cross) south of Leicester, and joined Ermine Street at Lincoln.

The word Fosse is derived from the Latin fossa, meaning ditch. For the first few decades after the Roman invasion of Britain in AD 43, the Fosse Way marked the western frontier of Roman rule in Iron Age Britain. It is possible that the road began as a defensive ditch that was later filled in and converted into a road, or possibly a defensive ditch ran alongside the road for at least some of its length.

It is remarkable for its extremely direct route. From Lincoln to Ilchester in Somerset is a distance of 182 miles. The road is never more than six miles from a straight line.

Place names with words like -cester or -chester are derived from the Latin castra, meaning 'military camp'. 'Street' is derived from the Latin strata, meaning a paved road.

Fosse Way still exists. In places it is a major road, in others a country path. The A46 between Lincoln and Leicester is on the Fosse Way. From Bath to Ilchester the A37 follows the Fosse, and from Ilchester to Exeter the A30/A303 roads follow the Fosse for the most part.

The Roman road is, quite simply, the shortest route possible.

White people are people with light skin. Most white people are of European origin, but are also found in other places. Sometimes it refers to a larger group: white people among other groups. The term "Caucasian" is often used as a synonym for "white people", but sometimes it means people of the Caucasus Mountains.

Before the modern age, no Europeans thought of themselves as "white". Instead, they defined their race, ancestry, or ethnicity in terms of their nationality (Greek, Roman, etc.).  The concept of a unified white race came into use in the 17th century, or later. The strongest proponents of racism in 20th century Europe, Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany, regarded some European peoples such as Slavs as racially different from themselves.

Thomas Peter Thorvald Kristian Ferdinand Mortensen (August 16, 1882 – April 25, 1998), known as an adult as Christian Mortensen, was a Danish-born American supercentenarian who lived to age 115 years, 252 days. At the time of his death, Mortensen was believed to be the second oldest person ever born in Europe behind Frenchwoman Jeanne Calment as well as the second-oldest man ever behind Japaneseman Shigechiyo Izumi. However, both of them are nowadays disputed, which means Mortensen was the oldest person ever born in Europe as well as the fifth oldest person ever in the world (behind Canadianwoman Marie-Louise Meilleur who died just nine days before him, Americanwoman Sarah Knauss who then was the oldest living person, Japanesewoman Tane Ikai and Americanwoman Maggie Barnes who died three months before him), the only man who became 115 years old (before Emiliano Mercado del Toro's 115th birthday on 21 August 2006) and the oldest man ever though until 27 December 2012 whereafter his record was broken by Japaneseman Jiroemon Kimura (who was the third man to become 115 years old as well as the only man to become 116 years old).

Mortensen was baptised in Fruering Church on December 26, 1882. Besides his baptismal record, other records include the 1890 and 1901 census enumerations in Denmark, and church confirmation in 1896.

[[Geometric abstraction]]

CATEGORIES: Art movements

Geometric abstraction is a form of abstract art based on the use of geometric forms in non-representational compositions. This art is not meant to depict our everyday visual world, but instead uses the shapes of basic geometry.

Wassily Kandinsky, one of the forerunners of pure non-objective painting, was among the first modern artists to explore this geometric approach in his abstract work. Other examples of pioneer abstractionists such as Kazimir Malevich and Piet Mondrian have also embraced this approach towards abstract painting.

Geometric abstraction is not just an invention of 20th century avant-garde artists or movements. It is present in many cultures throughout history both as decorative motifs and as art pieces themselves. 

Islamic art, in its prohibition of depicting religious figures, is a prime example of this geometric pattern-based art. It existed centuries before the modern movement in Europe, and in many ways influenced this Western school. Geometric patterns were often used in the architecture of Islamic civilisations from the 7th century-20th century, to visually connect spirituality with science and art.  

Abstract art has also historically been likened to music in its ability to convey emotional or expressive feelings and ideas without reliance upon or reference to recognizable objective forms already existent in reality. Wassily Kandinsky has discussed this connection between music and painting, as well as how the practice of classical composition had influenced his work, at length in his seminal essay Concerning the Spiritual in Art.

Expressionist abstract painting, as practiced by artists such as Jackson Pollock, is the opposite of geometric abstraction.  

Artists who have worked extensively in geometric abstraction include Josef Albers, Theo van Doesburg, Wassily Kandinsky, Kazimir Malevich, Piet Mondrian, Barnett Newman, Kenneth Noland, Bridget Riley, Alexander Rodchenko, Sophie Taeuber-Arp, among others.

France has a multi-party system, which means that several political parties must form coalitions in order to form a government. This is because it would be very difficult for any one party to win a majority of seats in the French National Assembly. Since the 1980s, there have been two major coalitions; one is a collection of right-wing parties and the other is a collection of left-wing parties.

For these accomplishments, historians refer to him as "the father of Athenian democracy".  He also increased the power of the Assembly, and he broke up power of the Athenian nobility.

With help from the his clan, he overthrew Hippias the tyrant (dictatorial ruler). After the collapse of Hippias' tyranny, Isagoras and Cleisthenes were rivals for power. Isagoras won the upper hand by appealing to the Spartan king Cleomenes I to help him expel Cleisthenes.

So Cleisthenes left Athens as an exile, and Isagoras held power in the city. Isagoras uprooted hundreds of people from their homes on the pretext that they were cursed, and attempted to dissolve the Council (βουλή, boulé). However, the Council resisted, and the Athenian people declared their support of it. Hence Isagoras and his supporters were forced to flee to the Acropolis, remaining besieged there for two days. On the third, they fled and were banished. Cleisthenes was subsequently recalled, along with hundreds of exiles, and he assumed leadership of Athens.

[[TERGV]]

CATEGORIES: Transport in France, High-speed rail

The TERGV (for Regional Express Train on high-speed line) is a model to run trains in Nord-Pas-de-Calais. The idea is to run regional trains on lines constructed for "express trains", instead of the "classic lines". This works only in the case that the high-speed line is used only rarely. Running regional trains on such lines slows down the express trains, and costs more than running them on the classic lines. Despite these problems, the concept is very promising for distances between 100 and 200 km.  

There are currently two lines that operate in this manner:

To use these connections, an extra fee must be paid, which is three euros, per day. Another line, Lille to Arras has been opened. This line does not require the extra fee, and has proved very successful.

CATEGORIES: Art movements

An art movement, or ism, is a style in art. It may have a common philosophy, followed by a group of artists. It may be a label given by a critic to describe a type of artwork. It is typical of the post-photography era that art explores new directions.

Some art movements can be pinned down to a time and place, or to particular artists. Verbal explanation of movements may come from the artists themselves, sometimes in the form of an art manifesto (published statement). Quite often, a movement is labelled afterwards by some art historian or critic.

Art movements may be connected to similar ideas in architecture, literature, philosophy or even politics. In rough date order:

[[Conceptual art]]

CATEGORIES: Conceptual art

Conceptual art is art in which the concepts or ideas involved in the work are more important than traditional aesthetic and material concerns. Many of the works, sometimes called installations, may be constructed by anyone simply by following a set of written instructions. This method was fundamental to one of the first to appear in print:

Conceptual art even questions the nature of art. Joseph Kosuth elevated this into a definition of art itself in his early manifesto of conceptual art. 

The notion that art should examine its own nature was already part of art critic Clement Greenberg's vision of modern art during the 1950s. With the emergence of an exclusively language-based art in the 1960s, however, conceptual artists began a far more radical analysis of art than was previously done. One of the first things they questioned was the assumption that the role of the artist was to create special kinds of material objects.

Conceptual art has come to mean all contemporary art which does not use the traditional skills of painting and sculpture.

In a rigid body, the centre of mass is always in the same place. In a loose collection the center of mass may be in space, as it is in the Solar System. Also, as planets' orbits change slightly, so will the position of the barycenter.

A simple way to understand the concept of barycenter is to push a supermarket trolley. If you hold only one corner and push, it will only go in a straight line when you push through the centre of mass. Otherwise a turning force is created. This shows that the mass acts as if it were only in one place.

The center of gravity is a closely related term. It is the point where an object can be balanced perfectly by a sharp point holding it up under the object. It is the center of mass acting in a gravitational field.

[[Marcel Duchamp]]

CATEGORIES: French artists, Chess players, 1887 births, 1968 deaths

Marcel Duchamp (28 July 1887 – 2 October 1968) was a French artist whose work is most often associated with the Dadaist and Surrealist movements. Duchamp's output influenced the development of post-World War I Western art. He advised modern art collectors, such as Peggy Guggenheim and other prominent figures, thereby helping to shape the tastes of Western art during this period.

A playful man, Duchamp challenged conventional thought about artistic processes and art marketing, not so much by writing, but through subversive actions such as dubbing a urinal art and naming it Fountain. This approach would 50 years later be called conceptual art, though he himself used the term 'ready-mades' for this idea. He produced relatively few artworks, while moving quickly through the avant-garde circles of his time.

[[Cheating in video games]]

CATEGORIES: Video game design

Cheating in video games is when a player creates an advantage for themself beyond what normal gameplay would allow. In general, cheating is breaking the rules to get an unfair advantage. In video games, a player usually cheats to make the game easier.

These kind of advantages can often be activated by entering codes. A set of cheat codes may have been written into the game's programming by the game's developers. When entered, a code activates a corresponding advantage. Cheat codes can also be created by added software, called a game trainer. Players can also cheat by taking advantage of software bugs in the game.

Cheat codes makes the system do things that are not normal. For example, pressing a certain sequence of buttons may increase a character's hit points in an role-playing game, or make a car drive faster in a racing game.

Another way of cheating is using applications called exploits. It usually involves injecting DLLs in the game application for access to advantages.

[[Photocathode]]

CATEGORIES: Physics, Tools, Alkali metals

A photocathode is a negatively charged electrode in a light detection device. They are the main type of photomultiplier. That means they take a little light, and make more of it.

There are instruments which need to magnify the amount of light coming in. Examples are astronomical telescopes and military night-sight equipment: binoculars and telescopes on helmets and rifles etc.

The lens of the telescope or binocular passes the light onto a layer of glass coated with a special light-sensitive metal. When this is struck by light, the absorbed energy causes electrons to jump off. This is called the 'photoelectric effect'. The freed electrons are then collected to produce the final image.

[[Space Shuttle Enterprise]]

CATEGORIES: Space Shuttles

The Space Shuttle Enterprise (OV-101) is a spacecraft used by NASA for testing of the space shuttles. Enterprise was built without engines and without the heat protection system needed for it to travel into space and return to the atmosphere. Enterprise began being built in June 4, 1974, and was completed on September 17, 1976. Enterprise was used for flight tests in 1977. Scientists wanted to test how the shuttle could be transported on top of a Boeing 747. They also did three test manned test flights with the shuttle still joined to the Boeing. When these test were finished they did another five tests with the shuttle flying without engines like a glider. The pilots practiced landing the shuttle at the Edwards Airforce Base. The pilots were astronaut Gordon Fullerton, Apollo 13 astronaut Fred Haise, Joe Engle and Dick Truly.   After the test flights, the Enterprise was used for vibration tests at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. After all the tests were finished, some parts of the Enterprise were used in the building of the other shuttles.

The Enterprise was going to be named the "Constitution", but many people wrote to the President and asked for it to be named after the space craft on the TV show Star Trek. Enterprise can be seen today by visitors to the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum's Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center near Washington, D.C.

Environmentally friendly (also eco-friendly, nature friendly, and green) are terms that refer to objects that people buy (called goods), services, laws, and rules that either do not harm the environment or do very little harm to it. To make people who buy the goods or services know that they are environmentally friendly, environmentally friendly goods and services often are marked  with eco-labels. But because there is no single type of eco-label, the International Organization for Standardization thinks that these labels do not mean much because they could mean different things.

[[Intranet]]

CATEGORIES: Internet

An intranet is a private network website that only a few selected computers can have access to. Usually, they are being used as internal company websites for employees to know more about what is happening in the company without letting other people see.

An intranet works the same way as a normal website. The system administrator can add webpages to it and it can be accessed normally from a web browser.

Russia has successfully tested Runet, a country-wide alternative to the internet. An expert said "Increasingly, authoritarian countries who want to control what citizens see are looking at what Iran and China have already done... It means people will not have access to dialogue about what is going on in their own country, they will be kept within their own bubble".

Modern day scribes, also known as "calligraphers",  study the work of Arrighi to learn the structure of the style of writing known as "italic" https://web.archive.org/web/20150909010855/http://www.beautifulcalligraphy.com/calligraphy-styles-calligraphy-fonts/, a modernized version of the Chancery hand which was first perfected by Roman scribes in the early part of the sixteenth century.

In typography, italic type is a cursive font based on a kind of calligraphic handwriting. Such letters normally slant slightly to the right.  

In modern texts, Italics can emphasise key points in a printed text. One manual of English usage described italics as "the print equivalent of underlining".

Calligraphy-inspired typefaces were first designed in Italy, to replace documents written in a handwriting style called chancery hand. As the illustration shows, there were flourishes copied from calligraphy. An alternative is oblique type: the type is slanted but the letterforms do not change shape: this less elaborate approach is used by many sans-serif typefaces.

The Japanese Occupation of Singapore is a time from 1942-1945 (during World War II) where the Japanese occupied Singapore. Japan attacked because Singapore was an important naval base for controlling other areas. The occupation started after the army of Japan defeated garrison troops from Australia, British Malaya, Britain, and India. This was at the Battle of Singapore. The British decided to surrender to the Japanese on 15 February 1942 at the Ford Motor Factory.

The city was renamed to Syonan-to (pronounced as Sho-nan-to), meaning Light of the South, during the rule. It was officially returned to the British after the peace treaty ending World War II was signed. 

The Japanese did not treat the people very well during their occupation.  There was a large amount of inflation because the Japanese printed paper money for Singapore to use, which did not have any identification numbers.  Also called 'banana notes' as they had a picture of a banana tree on them, the paper notes could have been printed by people who had a modern-day printer and sufficient paper.

[[Ligand]]

CATEGORIES: Biochemistry, Molecular biology

A ligand is a biochemical substance. Its function is to bind to a biological molecule, and make the molecule perform a function. Ligand binding alters the shape of the receptor protein. This changes the protein's behaviour. 

In a narrower sense, it is a signal triggering molecule, binding to a site on a target protein.

The binding occurs by intermolecular forces, such as ionic bonds, hydrogen bonds and van der Waals forces. The docking (association) is usually reversible (dissociation).  

Ligands include substrates, inhibitors, activators, and neurotransmitters. The tendency or strength of binding is called affinity.

[[Lead glass]]

CATEGORIES: Glass, Lead compounds

Lead glass, also known as lead crystal, is a type of glass that has lead in it. Normal glass has calcium oxide in it, while lead glass changes the calcium oxide with lead(II) oxide. It looks nice because the lead is very large and heavy and changes how the glass looks. Lead glass rings when tapped while ordinary glass does not. This glass can absorb some X-rays. It is very insulating. 

It contains between 18 to 40% of lead (II) oxide by weight. The nomenclature of lead glass is regulated such that any glass that contains a minimum of 24% PbO by weight is referred to as “lead crystal”, and any glass that contains less than 24% PbO by weight is referred to as crystal glass. Lead glass has a chemical composition of SiO2 and PbO along with other impurities or additives added to achieve certain properties.

Lead glass is also known as X-ray glass or radiation shielding glass as one of its major applications is in the absorbance of high energy radiation while maintaining optical transparency. The presence and quantity of PbO are what determines some of lead glass’ most important optical and physical properties.

It is protected by the skull and close to the main senses of vision, hearing, balance, taste, and smell. As an animal moves forward, its senses collect data about the surroundings, and that data goes directly to the brain.

Brains are extremely complex. The brain controls the other organs of the body, either by activating muscles or by causing secretion of chemicals such as hormones and neurotransmitters. Muscular action allows rapid and coordinated responses to changes in the environment; hormones and the autonomic nervous system make slower changes in the body.

It is also a part of human and animal body. The brain of  an adult human weights about  13001400 grams

In vertebrates, the spinal cord by itself can cause reflex responses as well as simple movement such as swimming or walking. However, sophisticated control of behaviour requires a centralized brain.

The structure of all vertebrate brains is basically the same. At the same time, during the course of evolution, the vertebrate brain has undergone changes, and become more effective. In so-called 'lower' animals, most or all of the brain structure is inherited, and therefore their behaviour is mostly instinctive. In mammals, and especially in man, the brain is developed further during life by learning. This has the benefit of helping them fit better into their environment. The capacity to learn is seen best in the cerebral cortex.

[[Foreign reserve]]

CATEGORIES: Money

A foreign reserve is the currency from another nation that is held by a nation's treasury. They are another set of assets in a country. Formerly, only gold and silver were used as reserves, but now the currency of other countries is used. There is a benefit to having a foreign reserve. When a nation has one, it can change the exchange rate to make it best for the country. But sometimes the exchange rate drops and the foreign reserve becomes worthless.

[[Cerebral cortex]]

CATEGORIES: Anatomy of the brain

The cerebral cortex is a most important part of the brain. In humans, it is by far the largest part of the brain.

Though this cannot be seen directly, different parts of the cortex have different functions (see diagram). It plays a key role in memory, attention, perceptual awareness, thought, language, and consciousness. 

It is a sheet of neural tissue that is outermost to the cerebrum of the mammalian brain. It has up to six layers of nerve cells. The human cerebral cortex is 2–4 mm (0.08–0.16 inches) thick.

In preserved brains, it is grey, so it is often called 'grey matter'. In contrast to gray matter that is formed from neurons and their unmyelinated fibers, the white matter below them is formed predominantly by myelinated axons interconnecting neurons in different regions of the cerebral cortex with each other and neurons in other parts of the central nervous system.

The surface of the cerebral cortex is folded in large mammals, such that more than two-thirds of it in the human brain is buried in the grooves.

[[Power line]]

CATEGORIES: Electricity

Power lines are wires that conduct electricity through to another place. Many have transformers. The voltage of the power at the end is usually 100V (Japan), 120V (North and Central America, parts of South America and Africa, and Saudi Arabia), or 220-240V (most of the rest of the world), but is much higher while going through the electric power transmission lines. The power at the end is then safe enough to be used when "stepped-down" by a transformer. 

The original power is made at a power plant. As the power is sent through the power lines, sometimes it encounters spots that it cannot go through. Then it will need to raise its voltage with a step-up transformer. The act is called "stepping up". Where the electric power distribution reaches buildings, this voltage is too dangerous to be used, so it goes through a step-down transformer. This is called "stepping down". Then the electricity can be distributed to buildings.

[[Greco–Persian wars]]

CATEGORIES: Ancient Greece, History of the Middle East, Wars, Achaemenid Empire

The Greco–Persian Wars were a series of wars fought between Classical Greece and Persia's Achaemenid Empire in the 5th century BC. The struggle lasted 50 years, from 499–449.  Herodotus wrote a history of the war.  Fifty years before the war started, Cyrus the Great had conquered the Greek colonies on the western coast of Asia Minor, an area the Greeks called Ionia. The Persians put a tyrant in charge of each city or polis. About 530 BC Cyrus died in battle.

Aristagoras, the Tyrant of Miletus was on an expedition to conquer the island of Naxos with Persian support, but that was a failure. Before he could be dismissed, Arisagoras encouraged Ionia to rebel against the Persians. This led to the Ionian Revolt.  Aristagoras got support from Athens and Eretria, and together they burnt the Persian regional capital city, Sardis. The Persian king, now Darius the Great, vowed revenge.

[[Caro–Kann defence]]

CATEGORIES: Chess openings

The Caro–Kann defence is a chess opening. It is a defence for Black when White opens by moving his King's pawn two squares on the first move. It begins: 

Usually, the next moves are:

It is then followed by 3.Nc3 (the Modern Variation), 3.Nd2 (the Classical Variation), 3.exd5 (the Exchange Variation), or 3.e5 (the Advance Variation). The modern variation (3.Nc3) is most popular. 

The Caro–Kann, like the Sicilian defence and French defence, is an asymmetrical defence to 1.e4. These are sometimes called 'semi-open games'. The Caro is thought to be more solid and less dynamic than the others, which means that play is likely to be more quiet and positional. It may lead to good endgames for Black, who has the better pawn structure.

The opening is named after the English player Horatio Caro and the Austrian Marcus Kann, who studied the opening in 1886.

[[Bronze Age collapse]]

CATEGORIES: Ancient Greece, Mesopotamia, Ancient Egypt, Ancient history, Archaeology, Hittite Empire

The Bronze Age collapse is so called by historians who study the end of the Bronze Age.

The palace economies of the Aegean and Anatolia of the late Bronze Age were replaced, eventually, by the village cultures of the 'Greek Dark Ages'.

Between 1200 and 1150 BC, the cultural collapse of the Mycenaean kingdoms, the Hittite Empire in Anatolia and Syria, and the Egyptian Empire in Syria and Canaan, interrupted trade routes and extinguished literacy.

In the first phase of this period, almost every city between Troy and Gaza was violently destroyed, and often left unoccupied: examples include Hattusa, Mycenae, Ugarit.

The gradual end of the Dark Age saw the rise of settled Neo-Hittite Aramaean kingdoms of the mid-10th century BC, and the rise of the Neo-Assyrian Empire.

[[Adolf Borsdorf]]

CATEGORIES: 1854 births, 1923 deaths, Classical horn players, German musicians

Adolph Borsdorf (born Dittmansdorf, Saxony, 25 December 1854; died London, 15 April 1923), was a German player of the French horn.

Borsdorf was born in Saxony in 1854.  He studied the French horn at the Conservatoire in Dresden and played in a military band.  In 1879, he moved to England where he stayed for the rest of his life, becoming the most important horn player in England.  The conductor Hans Richter offered him at job in the orchestra at Covent Garden.  In 1904, he joined the newly formed London Symphony Orchestra.  The four horn players in that orchestra were excellent players and were often called “God’s Own Quartet”.

Borsdorf and his colleague Franz Paersch had learned to play on horns that were made in Germany.  These had a wide bore (the hole through the tube).  However, both players changed to playing instruments made in France by a horn-maker called Raoux.  These instruments had a narrower bore.  They were not quite as powerful but gave a particularly clear sound.

Borsdorf became professor at the Royal College of Music when it was founded in 1882.  He also taught at the Royal Academy of Music.  He soon became the best horn player in London.  He was playing principal horn in the orchestra which Henry Wood conducted at the very first Promenade Concert in the Queen’s Hall in 1895 (the fourth horn was A.E.Brain, grandfather of Dennis Brain).  He was also in the orchestra when Richard Strauss’s Till Eulenspiegel was given its first performance in England in 1896 with the composer conducting.

In 1913, he became ill and had to have teeth removed.  There was also another problem for him: World War I broke out in 1914 and there was a lot of anti-German feeling in England.  After the war he rarely played in public.

Borsdorf died in 1923.  He had done more than anyone else to improve the standard of horn playing in England.  He taught many talented pupils, including A.E.Brain Jr., Aubrey Brain, Frank Probyn and his own three sons: Oskar, Francis and Emil who all became professional horn players.

[[Alfred Edwin Brain Sr.]]

CATEGORIES: 1860 births, 1929 deaths, Classical horn players, Musicians from London

Alfred Edwin Brain (born Turnham Green, London, 4 February 1860; died London, 25 October 1929), was an English player of the French horn.  He was the founder of a great school of English horn playing.  His grandson Dennis Brain became perhaps the most famous horn player of all time.  He is known as A.E .Brain Sr. (Senior) because one of his sons, who also was a famous horn player, had the same name.

A.E. Brain was born in 1860.  His father fought in the Crimean War and was invalid. Alfred was not well educated.  When he was 12 he joined the Scots Guards and played the horn in the band.  He married in 1880 and had seven children.  Two of the children became great horn players: Alfred and Aubrey.

He played in several orchestras, including the Philharmonic Society, the Queen’s Hall Orchestra and Covent Garden.  He played a lot for Henry Wood in The Proms.  In orchestras he nearly always played fourth horn, so his nickname was “George IV”.  In 1904 he became a founding member of the London Symphony Orchestra.  The four horn players in that orchestra: Adolf Borsdorf,  Thomas Busby,  Henri Van der Meerschen and A.E. Brain, were often called “God’s Own Quartet” because they blended together so well.

He died in 1929 after a short retirement.

[[Alfred Edwin Brain Jr.]]

CATEGORIES: 1885 births, 1966 deaths, Classical horn players, People from London

Alfred Edwin Brain Jr. (born London, 24 October 1885; died Los Angeles, 29 March 1966) was an English player of the French horn.  He came from a family which included many famous horn players, including his nephew, Dennis Brain who became perhaps the most famous horn player of all time.

A.E.Brain Jr (Junior, to distinguish him from his father who had the same name) was born in 1885.  His father, Alfred Edwin Brain Sr. was a well-known horn player.  Alfred started to learn the trumpet when he was six, but when he was twelve he changed to the French horn and learned from his father.  He studied at the Royal Academy of Music with Adolf Borsdorf and also learned the piano from G.D.Cunningham who was to teach his nephew the organ some forty years later.  His first professional job was with the Scottish Orchestra.  He then played in the Queen’s Hall Orchestra and the London Symphony Orchestra.  

When World War I broke out he joined the Scots Guards, but later, in 1917, he did a lot of dangerous work in France where the fighting was taking place.  After the war he was awarded the British War Medal and Victory Medal for his bravery.

When he returned after the war he got jobs with several of the London orchestras, including Covent Garden where he played for Sir Thomas Beecham.  His brother Aubrey, also an excellent horn player, returned from the war after him.  By this time Alfred had got all the best horn jobs in London, so it was difficult for Aubrey to find the best jobs.

In 1923 he emigrated to the United States.  He played in the New York Philharmonic Orchestra and later for the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra.  In his later years he recorded a lot in movie studios, including for 20th century Fox.

[[Skimboarding]]

CATEGORIES: Surfing

Skimboarding is a form of shallow water surfing. 

When the waves at shallow water were poor, surfers would often attempt to surf in shallow breaking water. This led to the making of smaller, lighter boards, named skimboards for the way they allow the user to skim across the surface of the water. Lifeguards were quick to adopt these new boards and used skimboarding as a way to quickly move up and down the beach in shallow water. Skimboarding has progressed and is now a recognized sport. Competitions are held each year around the world and produce large amounts of revenue for the market interested in this sport. These competitions also allow skimboarders to exhibit maneuvers that technology, evolution and skill have made possible.

[[Arminius]]

CATEGORIES: Germanic peoples, History of Germany, Ancient Rome, Rebellions in Europe

Arminius, also known as Armin or Hermann (b. 18 BC/17 BC in Magna Germania; d. AD 21 in Germania) was a chieftain of the Cherusci. He was able to unite a group of Germanic tribes together to fight the Romans. They destroyed a Roman army in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest. This was the greatest military disaster the Romans had ever suffered.

After the battle, Arminius immediately sent Varus' severed head to Maroboduus, king of the Marcomanni, the other most powerful Germanic ruler. Arminius offered an anti-Roman alliance. Marobod declined the offer, sending the head on to Rome for burial, and remained neutral throughout the ensuing war. Only later did a brief, inconclusive war break out between the two Germanic leaders.

[[Doctor of Medicine]]

Students need to have completed 90 to 120 credit hours of university level work  (see second entry degree) and in most cases should already have a Bachelors Degree.

In other countries, such as the United Kingdom and Germany, the Doctor of Medicine is an advanced academic research degree similar to a PhD or a higher doctorate.  In Britain, Ireland, and many Commonwealth nations, the qualifying medical degree is the Bachelor of Science in Medicine, Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS, BMBS, BM BCh, BM, MB BCh BAO, or MB ChB) and is the same as the M.D. degree in the U.S. system.

In these countries it is illegal to prescribe scrips (prescriptions) and perform operations without the basic degree; also usual is the membership of appropriate medical and/or surgical societies. The societies (such as the British Medical Association) act as a kind of sophisticated trades union for doctors. In the British system, the General Medical Council has legal authority for the medical register of doctors licensed to practice medicine. They can and do hold tribunals to decide whether doctors accused of misdeeds should be struck off the medical register. Therefore, to practice it is necessary not only to hold the medical degree(s), but also to be on the register.

[[Dumbledore's Army]]

Dumbledore's Army (often referred to as the D.A.) is an association in the Harry Potter series by J.K. Rowling. It is started in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix and continued in the last book, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows by member Neville Longbottom. This is an association created to prepare some pupils for beating Voldemort.

The leader, Harry Potter, teaches his friends how defend themselves against the Dark Lord. The idea for the D.A. came from Hermione Granger, who wanted the students to learn defensive spells which were not being taught by the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Delores Umbridge.

[[Photo editing]]

CATEGORIES: Photography

Photo editing is the changing of images. These images can be digital photographs, illustrations, prints, or photographs on film). Traditional editing, such as airbrushing, is done by hand. Now photo editing is done by programs such as Photoshop, Gimp and Microsoft Paint. 

Photo editing is done for many reasons. Many photos of models are edited to remove blemishes or make the model "better".  This is usually called retouching, airbrushing or Photoshopping, even if Photoshop or airbrushes are not used.  Other reasons to edit a photo include fixing errors (red eye, contrast, brightness, etc.), practical jokes, and to trick people. Photo editing is also used to make completely new images. Photo editing is sometimes called photo manipulation, a term which sounds negative.

[[Piñata]]

CATEGORIES: Toys

A piñata is a type of decoration with bright colors. It is made from either clay or cardboard and is covered with papier-mâché.

In Puerto Rico, Ecuador, Peru, Venezuela, Colombia and in some other Latin American countries, piñatas are traditionally used only at children's birthday parties.  They are usually made of cardboard, colorfully decorated to match the birthday party theme and filled with candy, chocolates, small toys and confetti.  Colored strings (long enough to reach the ground) are attached to the bottom of the piñata, where a trap-door is hidden under the decoration.  The piñata is then hung somewhere where everyone can see, but the strings are kept out of the reach of children.  Toward the end of the party, usually after the cutting of the cake, an announcement is made that the piñata will be 'broken' and each child is given an empty party bag.  All the children get together directly underneath the piñata and each child is given a string to hold.  Then, at the count of three, the children pull their strings all at the same time.  This opens the hidden trap-door (or 'breaks' the piñata) and the children receive a shower of candy and confetti while they rush to fill up their bags with the treats.

[[Hōei eruption of Mount Fuji]]

CATEGORIES: Natural disasters in Asia, 18th century in Japan, 1707, 1700s in Asia, 1708

The Hōei Eruption of Mount Fuji started on December 16, 1707 (23rd day of the 11th month of the year Hōei 4) and ended about January 1, 1708 (9th day of the 12th month of the year Hōei 4) during the Edo period.  There was no lava flow, but the Hoei eruption released at least 800 million cubic meters of volcanic ash. This ash spread over very large areas around the volcano. It even reached Edo almost 100 km away. Cinders and ash fell like rain in Izu, Kai, Sagami, and Musashi provinces. This eruption of Mount Fuji might have been caused by the 1707 Hōei earthquake

49 days earlier.

The eruption was on Mount Fuji's east–north-east slope and made three new volcanic openings called No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3 Hōei vents. The danger of the eruption increased over the next several days. After the first earthquake and explosion of cinders and ash, another stronger explosion happened a few days later. This explosion threw out rocks and stones.  Mount Fuji has not erupted since; but scientists describe Fuji as an active volcano.

Hokusai's One Hundred Views of Mount Fuji includes an image of the small crater which developed from a secondary eruption site on the southwestern slope.  This was called Hōeizan (Mount Hōei) because the eruption happened in year Hōei 4.

Today the crater can be visited from Fujinomiya Trail https://web.archive.org/web/20080731141625/http://mountfujiguide.com/guide/Fujinomiya_Trail or Gotemba Trail https://web.archive.org/web/20080827231504/http://mountfujiguide.com/guide/Gotemba_Trail of Mount Fuji.

[[Titanosaur]]

CATEGORIES: Titanosaurs

Titanosaurs were a group of large sauropod dinosaurs. Together with the brachiosaurs and relatives they make up the larger clade Titanosauriformes.

They were some of the heaviest creatures ever to walk the earth. Titanosaurs included Saltasaurus, Isisaurus,  Argentinosaurus and Paralititan. The group includes the largest land animals known to have existed, such as Patagotitan  estimated at 37 long with a weight of 69  and the comparably sized Argentinosaurus and Puertasaurus from the same region. They were named after the mythological Titans of Ancient Greece, Abdarainurus and Aegyptosaurus.

The titanosaurs were the last great group of sauropods before the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. They were the dominant herbivores of their time. The fossil evidence suggests they replaced the other sauropods, like the diplodocids and the brachiosaurids, which died out between the Upper Jurassic and the mid-Cretaceous.

[[Battle of Thermopylae]]

CATEGORIES: Ancient Greece, Achaemenid Empire, Battles of the Ancient World, 480 BC

The Battle of Thermopylae, 480 BC, was a battle in the second Persian invasion of Greece. It was fought between an alliance of Greek city-states, led by Sparta, and the Persian Empire of Xerxes I. It took place at the pass of Thermopylae. The battle was fought for over three days, at the same time as the naval Battle of Artemisium.

[[Coriolis effect]]

CATEGORIES: Force, Earth, Science

The Coriolis effect is a force that is found in a rotating object. Gaspard Gustave de Coriolis first described the Coriolis effect in 1835 using mathematics. The Coriolis effect can best be seen in hurricanes. In the northern hemisphere, they spin counter-clockwise (because the earth spins counter-clockwise), and in the southern hemisphere they spin clockwise.

One example of the Coriolis effect that is often described is that water flows down a drain in the opposite direction in the northern and southern hemispheres. However, in reality, the force of the Coriolis effect is not strong enough to see in such a small amount of water. 

[[Battle of Artemisium]]

CATEGORIES: Ancient Greece, Achaemenid Empire, Battles of the Ancient World, 480 BC

The naval Battle of Artemesium took place at the same time as the Battle of Thermopylae, in 480 BC.

Approaching Artemisium towards the end of summer, the Persian navy was caught in a gale off the coast of Magnesia and lost around a third of their ~1,200 ships.

After arriving at Artemisium, the Persians sent a detachment of 200 ships around the coast of Euboea in an attempt to trap the Greeks, but these were caught in another storm and shipwrecked.

The main action of the battle took place after two days of smaller engagements. The two sides fought all day, with roughly equal losses; however the smaller Allied fleet could not afford the losses.

After the engagement, the Allies received news of the defeat of the Allied army at Thermopylae. Their strategy was to hold both Thermopylae and Artemisium. So, given their losses, the Allies decided to withdraw to Salamis. The Persians overran Boeotia and captured the now-evacuated Athens. However, seeking a decisive victory over the Allied fleet, the Persians were later defeated at the Battle of Salamis in late 480

[[Wilderness]]

CATEGORIES: Ecosystems, Conservation, Geography

Wilderness or wildland is a natural environment on Earth which has not been much disturbed by humans.  

Wilderness areas can be found in reserves, estates, farms, conservation areas, ranches, National Forests, National Parks and even in urban areas along rivers, gulches or any undeveloped areas. These areas are important for the survival of species, biodiversity, ecology, conservation, solitude, and recreation. 

Wilderness is deeply valued for cultural, spiritual, moral, and aesthetic reasons. Some nature writers believe wilderness areas are vital for the human spirit and creativity. 

They may also preserve historic genetic traits and that they provide habitat for wild flora and fauna that may be difficult to recreate in zoos, gardens or laboratories.

From this point of view, it is the wildness of a place that makes it a wilderness. The mere presence or activity of people does not disqualify an area from being "wilderness". Many ecosystems that are, or have been, inhabited or influenced by activities of people may still be considered "wild." This way of looking at wilderness includes areas within which natural processes operate without human interference.

The WILD Foundation states that wilderness areas have two dimensions: they must be biologically intact and legally protected. The World Conservation Union (IUCN) classifies wilderness at two levels, Ia (Strict Nature Preserves) and Ib (Wilderness areas).  

Probably no place on earth is completely untouched by humanity, either due to past occupation by indigenous people, or through global processes such as climate change. Activities on the margins of specific wilderness areas, such as fire suppression and the interruption of animal migration, also affect the wilderness.

Especially in richer , industrialized nations, it has a specific legal meaning as well: as land where development is prohibited by law. Many nations have designated wilderness, including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa and the United States. 

Many new parks are currently being planned and legally passed by various Parliaments and Legislatures at the urging of dedicated individuals around the globe who believe that "in the end, dedicated, inspired people empowered by effective legislation will ensure that the spirit and services of wilderness will thrive and permeate our society, preserving a world that we are proud to hand over to those who come after us".

[[Electrical impedance]]

CATEGORIES: Electricity

Electrical impedance is the amount of opposition that a circuit presents to current or voltage change.

The two main ways to write an impedance are:

(see the 2nd figure, "complex impedance plane")

The Impedance and the resistance are quite similar:

In the case of resistance, a resistor resists any current going through it.  The higher the resistance, the higher the voltage that is needed to achieve a given current. The formula is:

In the case of impedance, an inductor resists changes to the current and the capacitor resists changes to the voltage.

The key difference between resistance and impedance is the word "change", the rate of change affects the impedance. Usually the "change" is expressed as a frequency, the number of times per second the current or voltage change direction. The formulas are:

For the inductor:

For the capacitor:

As indicated by the formulas above, the impedance varies depending on the frequency, for example, at zero Hertz, or DC, the impedance of the inductor is zero, the same as a short-circuit, and the impedance of the capacitor is infinite, the same as an open-circuit. Most signals are the sum of many sine waves at various frequencies (see the fourier transform for more details), and each of them experience a different impedance.

Similarly to the resistance, the higher the impedance, the higher the voltage that is needed to achieve a given current. The formula is:

At the physical level, simplifying many things:

One important difference between the resistance and the impedance is that a resistor dissipates energy, it gets hot, but an inductor and a capacitor store the energy and can return that energy to the source when it goes down.

If the impedance of the source, cable and load are not all equal, then a fraction of the signal is reflected back to the source, wasting power and creating interference. The ratio of the reflection can be calculated with:

[[Mesa Verde National Park]]

CATEGORIES: National parks in the United States, World Heritage Sites in the United States, Archaeological sites in the United States

Mesa Verde National Park is a United States National Park and UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is in Montezuma County, Colorado, United States.  The park was created in 1906 to protect some of the best preserved cliff dwellings in the world. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. 

The park occupies 81.4 square miles (211 square kilometers) near the Four Corners and features ruins of homes and villages built by the ancestral Puebloan people, sometimes called the Anasazi.  The ancestral Puebloans made these stone villages their home in the 13th century. However, the first ancestral Puebloans had settled in Mesa Verde over 600 years before the cliff dwellings were ever built.

These first people are known as the Basketmakers and they lived in pithouses clustered into small villages usually built on mesa tops but sometimes in the overhangs of the cliffs. These hunter-gatherer people settled and began farming and using the bow and arrow, a weapon that was more efficient and accurate than the atlatl. By 750 AD, the people were building mesa-top villages made of adobe. By the late 12th century they began to build the cliff dwellings for which Mesa Verde is famous.

Mesa Verde is best known for cliff dwellings, which are structures built within caves and under outcropping in cliffs — including Cliff Palace, which is thought to be the largest cliff dwelling in North America. The Spanish term Mesa Verde translates into English as "green table". Approximately 600 of the over 4700 archeological sites found in Mesa Verde National Park are cliff dwellings.

[[Shelling of Yeonpyeong]]

The shelling of Yeonpyeong was an exchange of artillery between the North and South Korean military on Yeonpyeong Island on 23 November 2010. After a South Korean artillery practice on the island, North Korea fired about 170 shells at Yeonpyeong. The shelling damaged the island greatly. It killed four South Koreans and hurt 19.

[[Data loss]]

CATEGORIES: Computer science

Data loss is an event that happens when a file, program, or a piece of information is lost. When data is updated, it may change, and this may not be data loss. Data loss also does not occur when the data is unavailable for some time only, for example because the server it is stored on cannot be reached. When this server can be reached again, the data will again be there.  There are some common causes to data loss. Data loss can sometimes be prevented by creating a backup copy. A backup copy may contain an older version of a file, which can make data loss less severe. If certain information used by the system is lost, the system may stop working. Getting the system working again and restoring the data from a backup copy may take a long time.

"The Anacreontic Song", also known by its incipit "To Anacreon in Heaven", was the official song of the Anacreontic Society, an 18th-century gentlemen's club of amateur musicians in London. Composed by John Stafford Smith, the tune was later used by several writers as a setting for their patriotic lyrics.

[[Lernaean Hydra]]

CATEGORIES: Greek legendary creatures, Monsters

In Greek mythology the Hydra (or Lernaean hydra) was a serpent-like monster. According to Theogony 313, the Hydra is the child of Typhon and Echidna. The Hydra had many heads. If you cut off one hydra head, two more would grow back in its place. It is also said that the Hydra's teeth were able to raise skeletons from the dead.  There are pictures of the Hydra on vases and bronze plates dating back as far as the 7th century BC.

Hercules (who is called "Heracles" in Greek mythology) kills the  Hydra as one of his labors. The Hydra lived in the lake of Lerna in the Argolis. The lake itself is older even than the Mycenaean city of Argos. Lerna was also the site of  the myth of the Danaids. 

The second of the 12 labors of Hercules was to kill the Hydra. The monster also had one immortal head that was in the middle. All of the heads could spit deadly acid. To defeat the Hydra, Hercules called on his nephew Iolaus for help. As soon as Hercules cut off one head, Iolaus would cauterise the wound with a flaming torch so that nothing could grow to replace it. After removing the Hydra immortal head, Hercules buried it under a large rock. Then he collected the monster's poisonous blood. In later adventures, he dipped his arrows in the blood to kill other monsters.

[[Planck time]]

CATEGORIES: Physics, Units of time

The Planck time is the length of time at which no smaller meaningful length can be validly measured due to the indeterminacy expressed in Werner Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. Theoretically, this is the shortest time measurement that is possible. Planck time is roughly 10−44 seconds. However, to date, the smallest time interval that was measured was 10−21 seconds, a "zeptosecond."

One Planck time is the time it would take a photon travelling at the speed of light to cross a distance equal to one Planck length.

It is calculated from the Planck constant, which was first thought of by the physicist Max Planck in 1900. This work by Planck asserts that the energy of a photon is proportional to its frequency, and their relation can be put in terms of familiar units such as the joule by using the proportionality constant Planck gave us. Heisenberg's original quantum theory was improved by his teacher and colleague Max Born. 

Born put Heisenberg's equation into a matrix form. Born immediately noticed that to calculate using these matrices, one matrix had to be multiplied by another matrix. In matrix multiplication, multiplying matrix P by matrix X gives a different result from the one obtained by multiplying matrix X by matrix P. He further noticed that the difference between the two matrices involves h, the Planck proportionality constant. It shows that one can never pin down things like P (momentum) and X (location) exactly. As a result, we cannot pin down a time any better than we can pin down a place or a momentum. We get closer and closer and then we reach the "Planck time."

In February 1988, during a reception in Kremlin, Mikhail Gorbachev said that he and his wife, Raisa, greatly admired Kaputikyan's poetry. She appeared as herself in the 1992 documentary Parajanov: The Last Spring, about Sergei Paradjanov, a legendary film-maker of Armenian descent who was persecuted by Soviet authorities (Sayat Nova).

[[Pointillism]]

CATEGORIES: Painting

Pointillism is a way of painting in which small separate dots of pure color are used to form images. The artist paints the picture with hundreds of tiny dots, mainly of red, yellow, blue and green, with white. The eye and mind of the viewer mix the colours to make different shades of these colours, as well as orange, purple, pink, and brown depending on the way the dots of colour are arranged. 

Georges Seurat, at first an Impressionist painter, and Paul Signac, developed this technique in 1886. Other important artists were Camille Pissarro and, in some paintings, Vincent van Gogh.  Art critics who saw their work, laughed at it and called it "Pointillism" as an insult. This name is still used, but is no longer thought of as an insult.

Traditionally, artists blend pigments (mix colours) on a palette. Pointillist painters do not mix the colours on the palette at all  they just use the colours straight from the tube. Traditional painters, and also impressionist painters, use many types of brushstrokes, and many textures of paint. The surface of the painting may have flat colour, lines, squiggles and dabs of paint. In a pointillist painting, every part of the picture is done in tiny dots, and most of the dots are about the same size. Pointillism is usually done in oil paints, because they are thick and do not run into each other when they are painted on the canvas.

[[Baud]]

CATEGORIES: Telecommunications

In telecommunications, Baud is the unit to measure the symbol rate. If one symbol can be transmitted per second, this is equal to one Baud. The unit is named after Jean-Maurice-Émile Baudot a French telecommunications engineer who invented the Baudot code. The Baud rate is different from the gross bit rate, measured in bits/second. 

Various electric signal schemes invented in the 20th century such as Phase-shift keying can make bit rates much higher than signal rates. In another example, gigabit ethernet has a symbol rate of 125MBd. Gigabit ethernet uses pulse-amplitude modulation and can transmit two bits of payload data per symbol. Gigabit ethernet uses four balanced pairs for transmission.

[[Sam Francis]]

CATEGORIES: 1923 births, 1994 deaths, American painters, American printmakers, People from San Mateo, California

Samuel Lewis Francis (June 25, 1923, San Mateo, California – November 4, 1994, Santa Monica, California) was an American painter and printmaker.  He was born in San Mateo, California, and studied botany, medicine and psychology at the University of California, Berkeley. He served in the United States Air Force during World War II before being injured in a plane crash. He was in the hospital for several years, and it was while he was there that he began to paint. Once he was out of the hospital he returned to Berkeley, this time to study art.

Francis was initially influenced by the work of abstract expressionists such as Mark Rothko, Arshile Gorky and Clyfford Still. He spent the 1950s in Paris, having his first exhibition there in 1952. While there he became associated with Tachisme. He later spent time in Japan, and some have seen an influence from Zen Buddhism in Francis’ work.

Francis spent some time in Paris making entirely monochromatic works, but his mature pieces are generally large oil paintings with splashed or splattered areas of bright contrasting colour. Areas of white canvas are often left to show through, and in later works, paint is sometimes confined to the edges of the canvas.

Francis returned to California during the 1960s and continued painting in Los Angeles.   During the final three decades of his career his style of large scale bright Abstract Expressionism was also closely associated with Color Field painting.  During the last year of his life, suffering from prostate cancer and unable to paint with his right hand after a fall, in a final burst of energy he used his left hand to complete a dazzling series of about 150 small paintings before he died.  He was buried in Olema, in Marin County, California.

After the death of the artist, the Samuel L. Francis Foundation, Inc. (also known as the "Samuel L. Francis Art Museum, Inc." or the "Sam Francis Foundation") was founded. The Foundation not only serves as his official Estate, but also has a mission "to research, document, protect and perpetuate the creative legacy of Francis." The U.S. copyright representative for the Francis Foundation is the Artists Rights Society.

As of 2008, the Foundation is working to create a Catalogue Raisonné of Francis's work. In addition to collecting information on known Francis works, they also have a page dedicated to "missing works" for which they are seeking any information interested parties may have.

In 2010, artist and filmmaker Jeffrey Perkins released the documentary "The Painter Sam Francis". The documentary includes film of Francis at work, filmed between 1968 and the early '90s together with interviews with friends, family, and professional associates of Francis.

[[Proposition]]

CATEGORIES: Philosophy, Logic

It is possible to express the same proposition in many way. Proposition are only concerned with actual meaning, not the way the proposition is expressed. Propositions can look different, yet still mean the same thing. When two different propositions mean the same thing, they are said to be synonymous, meaning each statement has the same meaning. 

For example, "Snow is white" (in English) and "Schnee ist weiß" (in German) are different sentences, because they are written in different languages. However, they mean exactly the same thing: snow is white. No matter what language the statement is written in, it will mean the same thing. As a result, these statements are synonymous. 

In Aristotelian logic, a proposition is a specific kind of sentence that confirms or denies an action or predicate took place through a subject. Aristotelian propositions take forms like "All men are mortal" and "Socrates is a man". In each sentence, the subject (men, Socrates) has a status (are mortal, is a man) which can be regarded as true or false.

In logical positivism, a proposition whose truth value cannot possibly be decided is meaningless (Quine, for instance, believes that propositions generally have no clear criterion of identity). For example, statements about the existence of deities cannot be proved under logical positivism. Because the statements have no truth value, a logical positivist would consider propositions about deities (such as "God exists" or "God does not exist") to have no logical meaning.

[[Karst]]

CATEGORIES: Sedimentary rocks, Badlands

Karst is a geological system of rocks where water has eroded (dissolved) the bedrock. If it is very extensive, karst can be a geographical or topographical feature. It is classed as a badland if it difficult to travel through the environment, which it often is.

Almost always, karst is formed in carbonate rocks, such as limestone or dolomite. Since carbonate sedimentary rocks are very common, karst areas occur all over the world.

Many karst regions display distinctive surface features, with sinkholes being the most common. However, karst surface features may be absent where the soluble rock is mantled (covered), such as  by a non-soluble rock strata on top of the carbonate strata. Some karst regions include thousands of caves, and the water is generally underground.

The world's largest karst area is the Nullarbor Plain, part of the area of flat, almost treeless, dry country of southern Australia. It is on the Great Australian Bight coast with the Great Victoria Desert to its north. It is the world's largest single exposure of limestone bedrock, and occupies an area of about 200000. At its widest point, it stretches about 1100 from east to west across the border region between South Australia and Western Australia.

[[Gravel]]

CATEGORIES: Rocks, Mining

Gravel is small, loose, rock particles. It is any loose rock that is larger than 2 mm (0.079 in) in its smallest dimension (about 1/12 of an inch) and no more than 64 mm (2.5 in).

Small gravel is composed of granules (>2 to 4 mm/0.079 to 0.16 in). Large gravel is called pebbles (>4 to 64 mm/0.16 to 2.5 in). 

Particles smaller than gravel are sand, larger particles are cobbles.

Gravel and sand are used for road surfaces, and for cement and Tarmac. Mixtures of gravel and sand mixed with various crushed material, are known as aggregate in the trade. This is used for drainage in the basement of roads, and other purposes. Mixture of stones and resin is also used to pave footpaths, driveways, etc. This mixture is known as Resin Bonded Gravel.

[[Spice trade]]

CATEGORIES: Trade routes

People have been using spices for thousands of years. Often they wanted ones that didn't grow near them, so they got them from far away. One of the biggest spice routes was a route between Asia and Europe. 

Only a few spices grew in Europe, so the others had to be brought from Asia. People made a route to go from Europe to Asia to buy spices. The route was very difficult and so the spices were expensive. People tried to find ways cheaper than the spice route, including going the other way around the world. This made the Age of Discovery, when they found places that they didn't know about, such as the Western Hemisphere.

Countries traded spices for gold and other things. They did this so they could get new spices or gain money and gold by selling their own. Sometimes people traded the spices because their country is running out of that certain spice.

[[Meson]]

CATEGORIES: Quantum mechanics, Subatomic particles

Mesons are incredibly small subatomic particles that are made of one quark and one antiquark. Antiquarks are the antimatter counterpart of a regular quark. Since antimatter quarks have the opposite spin of regular quarks, their spins can cancel each other out, which forms a particle similar to a Higgs Boson. The name meson comes from Greek "mesos", meaning middle. This is because the masses of the first mesons discovered were between the mass of light particles like electrons, called leptons, and heavy particles like protons, called baryons.

The Blue Lias is a formation of rocks mostly in south west England and parts of south Wales. It is part of the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site.

It is part of the Lias Group. The Blue Lias consists of a sequence of limestone and shale layers. It was laid down in late Triassic and early Jurassic times, between 195 and 200 million years ago. The Blue Lias is famous for its fossils, especially ammonites. Also found were remains of a number of dinosaurs, and the pterosaur Dimorphodon.

The Blue Lias alternates between limestone, (with some clay), and mudstone. These alternations are caused by short-term climatic variations, thought to be caused by Milankovitch cycles. The blue/grey colour is given by iron pyrite.

A bit higher, these limestone-mudstone alternations change into a clay member. The deposition of a clay-rich mudstone member shows it was laid down in a deeper marine environment.

[[Film processing]]

CATEGORIES: Photography

Photographic film is able to record images.  In order to make these images visible, the film needs to undergo a number of chemical processes. The result of these processes will either be negatives or slides. This is generally known as developing. Different films need different processes. The process for black and white film is different from that for slide film. In general, the process involves the following steps:

There are different kinds of films. The most common of these is film negative.  With negative film, all colors are reversed. This is corrected in an additional step of making a print of each image.  

So called reversal film, which is used for diapositives, directly produces positive images (which are framed to become a slide). 

This whole process is known as film processing.

[[Mineral water]]

CATEGORIES: Water

Mineral water is water obtained from rocks. It is often collected from springs or from underground rivers when they emerge from the rocks. Mineral waters are very clean and have no germs in it. Because they have been held in rocks for a long time they often contain chemicals that have come from the rocks. This chemicals can give the water an interesting taste. Some mineral waters may be good for health. Because some underground water comes to the surface from very deep layers in the earth, it can also have carbon dioxide gas dissolved in it. This can make the water fizzy.

[[Sewage treatment]]

CATEGORIES: Waste management

Sewage treatment is the process of dealing with sewage so that it  does not cause harm to people or to rivers. Sewage flows in sewer pipes from houses and factories. When it arrives at a sewage treatment plant it passes through many stages. Larger treatment plants often have more stages than smaller ones. 

Large objects and rags are removed using screens. The sewage then flows through a tank so sand and grit can fall out.  This protects the machines in later stages. 

Fats and solids are removed in the first treatment stage.  Sewage enters a tank where solids fall to the bottom and fat floats to the top.  Fats and solids stay in the tank and the water continues to the next stage. This is called primary treatment.

Modern sewage treatment started in London about 1850. The first treatment plants for sewage were designed by Sir Joseph Bazalgette.

[[Sewage]]

CATEGORIES: Waste management

Sewage or domestic wastewater is the liquid waste produced by people when using the toilet, having a bath or shower or washing clothes and dishes.  In some places it also includes rain-water falling on houses and roads.  It can also have liquid waste from factories in it.  It flows in pipes called sewers to be cleaned up at a sewage treatment works.

Sewage is mostly water but it also has many microbes some of which can be harmful.  It can have many chemicals in it which can also cause harm to animals and humans.  Most sewage in poor counties is not treated, and may spread disease.

Superstar K (슈퍼스타 K) is a South Korean television talent show series which is held every year. The concept is the same as the Pop Idol franchise. It involves finding the next "superstar". The winner each week is worked out through scores given by judges and votes from viewers. First held in 2009, Superstar K has become more and more popular. 

As the slogan of this program is “Sing the miracle”, plenty of people who volunteered “Season 2” to become a singer were about 1,430,000. Furthermore, the audition was held by Seoul, Busan, Daejeon, Daegu, Incheon, Jeju, Gwangju, Chuncheon, and even LA. 

This audition has lots of stages. First, participants should take the first local preliminary round, and after passing it, they face the second, and then the third. After the third round, all participants from all areas gather to Seoul, and semi round, called “Super Week”, is began. From this stage, all stages become survival formats, and keen. After the round, 11 people are chosen as last members, and they stay at the same house, take the vocal training, and compete each other every week. Finally, the one who survive from the competition win the audition. In this audition, famous judges appear. The judges are Korean popular singers, Seungchul Lee, Jongsin Yoon, and Junghwa Um. These singers judge each participant. As this is TV show, viewers can join the judgment. When last 11 people compete each other, viewers can vote who they want, and it accounts for 60%. The singers’ judgment forms 30%, and the rest is up to internet survey. 

The winner of each season gets huge rewards. In Season 2, the winner, named Gak Heo, got ₩200 million, a car worth about ₩25 million. In addition, a famous music producer made his album and a music video. He also performed at the Mnet Asian Music Awards. The album of Ingook Seo, the winner of the Season 1, ranked at the top of the charts for several weeks.

[[River Teifi]]

CATEGORIES: Rivers of Wales

The River Teifi is a river in west Wales. It starts in the hills above the town of Tregaron and then flows into a large marsh called Tregaron bog. This bog helps to stop flow in the river being too extreme. It stores up flood water when it is raining hard and it lets water go during dry weather.

The water in the River Teifi is very good quality. The river supports lots of wild-life including Salmon and Trout. The wildlife is so special that the whole river has been given special protetion by scientists to stop it being damaged.

The river passes through small towns such as Lampeter and Newcastle Emlyn before it reaches the sea at Cardigan. For the last few miles before it reaches Cardigan, the river runs through a deep gorge called Cigerran Gorge. Some people still fish for Salmon here using a very ancient boat called a Coracle.

[[River Ystwyth]]

The River Ystwyth (ˈ; Afon Ystwyth) is a river in west Wales. It starts  in the hills between Rhayader and Ysbyty Ystwyth and flow into the sea at Aberystwyth. Although the river looks very clean, it has high levels of some metals such as lead, zinc and silver. These metals poison a lot of the wildlife so that only a few things live in some of the river. These metals get into the river from old lead mines. Nobody uses the mines any more but the waste material left behind still has lots of metal in it and this dissolves in rain and gets into the river.

[[Knut (polar bear)]]

CATEGORIES: Individual animals, Berlin, Deaths from encephalitis

Knut (5 December 2006– 19 March 2011) was a polar bear who was born in captivity at the Berlin Zoo. Because his mother rejected him when he was born, he was raised by zookeepers. People began to protest for him after a German newspaper called Bild-Zeitung quoted an animal rights activist saying the young cub had to die. Both children and adults supported him, and e-mails and letters asking the zoo to let the cub live were sent from around the world. Because of his fame, Knut became a tourist attraction and commercial success.

Knut became very popular and the center of mass media attention called "Knutmania". Many toys, DVDs, and books were made about him. This brought in lots of money, about five million euros, to Berlin Zoo in 2007.  More people went to the zoo, and that year was the most profitable year in the zoo's 163-year history.

Polar bear Knut died on 19 March 2011, because of the brain disease encephalitis.

[[Cottage pie]]

CATEGORIES: Savoury pies, British food

Cottage pie or shepherd's pie is a type of savory pie. It is made with minced meat, with mashed potato on top. It comes from the United Kingdom and Ireland. The dish is now popular worldwide.

The name "cottage pie" was first used at the end of the 18th century. It was around that time that the poorer people of Britain, people who lived in cottages in the country, started using potatoes as an everyday food. Originally, a pie made with any kind of meat and mashed potato was called a "cottage pie". 

In modern British English, the dish is usually called "cottage pie" if it is made with beef. If it is made with lamb it is usually called "shepherd's pie" (because a shepherd looks after sheep). The modern day cottage pie may now contain vegetables, lentils or beans in place of meat. 

According to the Oxford Companion to Food, once upon a time, Scotland made its shepherd’s pies with pastry instead of mashed potatoes.

[[Light beam]]

[[Freshwater biology]]

CATEGORIES: Biology

Freshwater biology is the study of plants and animals that live in fresh water. This includes rivers, lakes, ponds, marshes and other bodies of water. It is part of the branch of science called Limnology.

Much freshwater biology takes place in man-made places such as sewage treatment works and water treatment works. In these places water is purified using plants and animals. Keeping them working as hard as possible helps to make the water as cleaner.

In recent times freshwater biologists have been looking at how plants and animals change in the autumn and spring. This is helping us to understand more about the effects of climate change.

[[Tincture of iodine]]

CATEGORIES: Chemicals

Tincture of iodine is a disinfectant. It has iodine and potassium iodide dissolved in ethanol and water. Normally, iodine does not dissolve in water. But when potassium iodide

is added, the iodine can dissolve. Also, ethanol helps iodine dissolve. Tincture of iodine has about equal amounts of iodide and iodine. It is not suitable for consumption. There are two types Tincture''': for every 100 mL, it has 6.8 to 7.5 grams of iodine, 4.7 to 5.5 grams of potassium iodide, and 50 mL ethanol. The rest is water.

It can be used as a skin disinfectant and as a water disinfectant. It is used to disinfect minor cuts, burn and scratches. Because it has iodine in it, it is toxic in large amounts. Lugol's iodine is an alcohol-free version. It is commonly used in experiments in middle school science labs. It is an alcoholic solution of iodine.

CATEGORIES: Roads

A toll road (also called a turnpike, toll highway, or express toll route) is a road for which vehicles must pay a fee to use, called a "toll". Toll roads are there in part to control the number of people using it. They may be built to allow some users to travel faster and avoid traffic congestion, speeding up traffic. In the past, tolls were collected to give income to governments or landowners. Today, tolls can be considered a form of tax which pays for the cost of road construction and maintenance that are not charged on those who do not use that road.

Later this college developed as the Hindu University of Benarus. Annie Besant started the India Home Rule movement in 1916 and became its president. In 1917 she became a leading member of the Indian National Congress.

[[Halophile]]

CATEGORIES: Microbiology, Extremophiles

Halophiles are organisms that need salt in their environment to live. Halophiles live in evaporation ponds or salt lakes such as Great Salt Lake, Owens Lake, or Dead Sea. The name "halophile" comes from Greek for "salt-loving". 

Most halophiles are archaeans, but some bacteria and eukaryotes are also halophiles, such as the alga Dunaliella salina. 

== Lifestyle ==  

Most halophilic and salt-eating animals use energy to remove salt from their cytoplasm. Normally, organisms living around a lot of salt would lose water and die because of osmosis. Water inside the organism would move from inside the cell to its outside environment. This is because there is always movement of water to reach a state where the concentrations of salt are the same on both sides of the cell membrane.

To survive, the cytoplasm of halophiles must be isotonic with its environment. 

To get to this state, halophiles use two different methods. In the first (mainly used by bacteria, some archaea, yeasts, algae and fungi), organic compounds are stored in the cytoplasm. These compounds help the organism survive the stress of osmosis. The most commonly used solutes for this process are neutral and include amino acids and sugars. Advantages to this method are that organisms can live in a wider range of salt concentrations. Also, if proteins are not exposed to high salt levels, they do not have to adapt to high salt levels. It requires the organism to use much more energy then the adaption below. 

The second, less common adaptation, is the selective intake  of potassium (K+) ions into the cytoplasm. In exchange, the organism pumps sodium (Na+) ions out with the help of the sodium-potassium pump. Ions of sodium may be used instead of potassium, but potassium is the most common. This adaptation is only used by one order of bacteria and one family of Archaea. An advantage to this method is that it uses much less energy than the adaption above. The main disadvantage to this adaption is that all of the machinery inside the cell (enzymes, structural proteins, etc.) must be adapted to high levels of non-organic ions, and high salt levels. This is much more demanding than the adaptation described above.

Most halophilic organisms only use one of the two methods, but a few  halophiles can use both.

Owens Lake is a mostly dry lake in the eastern Sierra Nevada of Inyo County, California, located about 5 south of Lone Pine, California. Unlike most dry lakes in the Basin and Range Province that have been dry for thousands of years, Owens held water until 1924. Today, some of the flow of the river has been restored, and the lake now has some water.

[[Dunaliella salina]]

CATEGORIES: Extremophiles

Dunaliella salina is a type of halophile pink micro-algae found in sea salt fields. Dunaliella salina is used in cosmetics and dietary supplements. Few organisms can survive in such highly saline conditions as salt evaporation ponds. To survive, these organisms have high concentrations of beta-carotene to protect against light, and high concentrations of glycerol to provide protection against osmotic pressure. This offers an opportunity for commercial biological production of these substances.

[[Scarification]]

CATEGORIES: Body art

Scarification or cicatrization is a form of body modification, where a design or pattern is cut, etched or scratched into human skin to make a permanent scar. Like with most body modification, there are many reasons why people choose to be scarified. The act of scarifying has been compared to tattooing due to the fact that it permanently changes the skin. It has also been identified with self harm because people have used it to cover self-inflicted wounds.

Scarification began as cultural identification in some places, especially in Maori and African societies. Other cultures may use it for religious reasons, and nearly all cultures use it for aesthetics. Some people also use scarification for pleasure, as the process of being scarified creates endorphins.

[[Haloarchaea]]

CATEGORIES: Protista

Haloarchaea are halophiles. They need a high salt concentrations to grow. They are a distinct evolutionary branch of the Archaea, and are extremophiles.

The term halobacteria is a misnomer (mistaken name), because we now know the archaea are a different group from bacteria.

In taxonomy, the Haloarchaea are a class of the Euryarchaeota, found in water with salt. They are common in most environments where large amounts of salt, moisture, and organic material are available.

[[Cowbird]]

CATEGORIES: Birds of North America, Parasites

Cowbirds are birds of the genus Molothrus. They are brood parasites, similar in life-style to the Cuckoo. The entire family Icteridae is limited to the New World.

They lay their eggs in the nests of other birds. The birds whose nest is used by the cowbird is tricked into raising the young cowbirds.

These birds feed on insects, including those stirred up by cattle. They lay their eggs in other birds' nests. This means that the birds can more easily stay with the herd.

The Brown-headed Cowbird has over 220 hosts. The other cowbird species have fewer known hosts, but all the species are generalists when it comes to choosing a host. This means that the eggs may look very different from the hosts' eggs.

Arthur Howey "Art" Ross (January 13, 1886 – August 5, 1964) was a Canadian ice hockey defenceman and executive from 1905 until 1954. Thought of as one of the best defenders of his time by his peers, he was one of the first to skate with the puck up the ice instead of passing it to a forward. He won the Stanley Cup twice in a playing career that lasted thirteen seasons; in January 1907 with the Kenora Thistles and 1908 with the Montreal Wanderers. Like other players of the time, Ross played for many teams and leagues, and is most familiar for when he played with the Wanderers while they were members of the National Hockey Association (NHA) and its successor, the National Hockey League (NHL). In 1911 he led one of the first player strikes over the players wanting more money. When the Wanderers' home arena burned down in January 1918, the team stopped playing so Ross retired as a player.

After working as an on-ice official for a few years, he became head coach of the Hamilton Tigers for one season. When the Boston Bruins were created in 1924, Ross was hired as the first coach and general manager of the team. He would go on to coach the team four different times until 1945 and stayed as general manager until his retirement in 1954. Ross helped the Bruins finish first place in the league ten times and to win the Stanley Cup three times; Ross coached the team to one of the Stanley Cup victories. After he was hired by the Bruins, Ross, along with his wife and two sons, moved to a city near Boston, and became an American citizen in 1938. He died near Boston in 1964.

Ross was also important in creating different inventions for hockey to make it better. He created a style of hockey puck still used today, and also created an improved style of goal nets, which were used for forty years. In 1947 Ross gave the NHL the Art Ross Trophy, which is given to the best scorer of the NHL regular season. In 1949, the Hockey Hall of Fame named Ross.

[[Firmicutes]]

CATEGORIES: Gram-positive bacteria

The Firmicutes are a phylum of bacteria, most of which have the Gram-positive type of cell walls.

[[Proteobacteria]]

CATEGORIES: Gram-negative bacteria

The Proteobacteria are a major phylum of bacteria.

They are gram-negative bacteria. This means they do not retain the violet dye in the Gram staining protocol.

In a Gram stain test, a counterstain (commonly safranin) is added after the crystal violet, colouring all gram-negative bacteria with a pink colour.

The test itself is useful in classifying two distinct types of bacteria based on the structural differences of their cell walls.

Proteobacteria include a wide variety of pathogens, such as Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Vibrio, Helicobacter, and many other notable genera.

Others are free-living, and include many of the bacteria responsible for nitrogen fixation. The group is defined primarily in terms of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequences.

Most members are facultatively or obligately anaerobic, chemoautotrophs, and heterotrophic, but there are numerous exceptions.

There are alphaproteobacteria in this phylum which are widely found in marine plankton. They may constitute over 10% of the open ocean microbial community.

James Gaye Stewart (June 28, 1923 - November 18, 2010) was a Canadian professional ice hockey forward. He played nine seasons as a left winger in the National Hockey League.

Born in Fort William, Ontario, Stewart was promoted from the minors in 1942 to play in one game of the Stanley Cup Finals, where he helped the Toronto Maple Leafs win the championship. The next season, Stewart won the 1943 Calder Trophy, beating out Maurice 'The Rocket' Richard of the Montreal Canadiens. He became the first player to win the Stanley Cup before the Calder. Danny Grant, Tony Esposito and Ken Dryden have accomplished it as well since then.

After spending two years in the Royal Canadian Navy during World War II, Stewart returned to the NHL in 1945 and had his best season, leading the league with 37 goals - the last time a Leaf led the League in scoring. Stewart won his second Stanley Cup, again with the Maple Leafs, in 1947. Toronto traded Stewart to Chicago early in the 1947-48 season in a deal that brought Max Bentley to the Leafs, and he had three 20-goal seasons for the Black Hawks before finishing his career with stints in Detroit, New York and Montreal. In all, Gaye Stewart played for five of the NHL's Original Six teams, all except the Boston Bruins. He played 502 career NHL games, scoring 185 goals and 159 assists for 344 points.

[[Chondrostei]]

CATEGORIES: Ray-finned fish

The Chondrostei are a sub-class of ray-finned fish, the Actinopterygii. They include the sturgeons, huge fish which provide caviar.

The Chondrostei are mainly cartilaginous fish with some ossification. There are 52 species divided among two orders. The orders are the Acipenseriformes (sturgeons and paddlefishes), and the Polypteriformes (reedfishes and bichirs). 

This group has at times been classified with the sharks: the similarities are obvious, not only do the chondrosteans mostly lack bone, the structure of the jaw is more akin to that of sharks than other bony fish. Both lack scales (except the Polypteriforms). Additional shared features include spiracles and, in sturgeons, a heterocercal tail (the vertebrae extend into the larger lobe of the caudal fin). However the fossil record suggests that these fish have more in common with the Teleostei than their external appearance might suggest.

[[Lifeboat]]

CATEGORIES: Safety, Boats

A lifeboat, also known as a liferaft, is a small, stiff or inflatable boat carried for emergencies in the event of a disaster on a ship. Lifeboats are required by law to be on larger ships.

When steamships became commonplace in the 19th century, so did lifeboats. At the beginning of the 20th century larger ships meant that more people could travel, but rules about lifeboats were often overlooked. After the RMS Titanic sank on April 15, 1912, people realized that bigger ships need more lifeboats. The Titanic's lifeboats were only capable of carrying 1,178 people although the Titanic had 3,330 people.

Because many lifeboats were needed on the decks of passenger ships this led to the use of most of the deck space being used for lifeboats which created the problem of narrow passageways. This was fixed by inflatable lifeboats being used.

[[Overpopulation]]

CATEGORIES: Demography, Population, Ecology, Environmental issues

Overpopulation means that the population of a place is too high. Specifically, there are too many organisms of a certain species in a habitat, so the number of organisms living there is larger than the carrying capacity of the habitat. The habitat cannot support these numbers over time without hurting itself.

The term "overpopulation" is most often used to refer to the number of too many humans living on Earth.

[[Pharmacoepidemiology]]

CATEGORIES: Pharmacology, Drugs, Epidemiology

Pharmacoepidemiology studies the use and effects of drugs on large groups of people and patients. It assesses probability of beneficial and adverse effects, and risks for humans while using a particular drug. 

Pharmacoepidemiology bridges pharmacology and epidemiology and borrows their methodology from both of them. It uses descriptive epidemiological method by describing exposure to a drug and by calculating rates, e.g., incidence and prevalence. Such descriptive method generates hypothesis about influence of the drug, but does not test it. Pharmacoepidemiology also uses analytic epidemiological method by means of observation (case-control and cohort studies) and experimentation (clinical trial). The analytic study compares an exposed group with a control group and serves as testing of the hypothesis.  

Pharmacoepidemiology provides pharmacovigilance, the later is a type of continual monitoring of unwanted effects and other safety-related aspects of drugs in current growing integrating markets.  Pharmacovigilance is conducted by spontaneous reporting systems through health care professionals and others which report adverse drug reactions to the central agency. The central agency combines reports from many sources to produce a more informative profile for drug products.

[[Carrying capacity]]

CATEGORIES: Ecology

In ecology, the carrying capacity of an environment is the number of organisms of a particular species that can live there depending on the amount of resources it has. If too many organisms live in an environment, it is called overpopulation.

The carrying capacity of an environment can change, and humans can have an effect on the carrying capacity. For example, agriculture and irrigation allow feeding more people; meaning the human carrying capacity is increased.

Some things that can change an environment's carrying capacity are pollution and the use of natural resources.

[[Chloroflexi]]

CATEGORIES: Bacteria

Chloroflexi is one of four classes of bacteria that produce energy from light and are named for their green pigment, usually found in photosynthetic bodies. 

Chloroflexi are typically filamentous (they look like microscopic strings), and can move about through bacterial gliding. They are facultatively aerobic (they can survive with oxygen or without it), but do not produce oxygen in the process of producing energy from light, or phototrophy. Additionally Chloroflexi have a different method of phototrophy (photoheterotrophy) than true photosynthetic bacteria. Phylogenetic analysis (looking at DNA) indicates that they had a separate origin.

[[Auto-Tune]]

CATEGORIES: Music software, Music technology, 1997 in music

Auto-Tune is a proprietary audio processor made by Antares Audio Technologies. Auto-Tune uses a ph vocoder to fix pitch in vocal and instrumental performances. It is used to hide out of tune singing and mistakes. It lets singers perform perfectly tuned vocal tracks without needing to sing in tune. Its main purpose is to slightly bend sung pitches to the nearest true semitone. Auto-Tune can also be used as an effect to distort the human voice when pitch is raised/lowered a lot.

Auto-Tune can be used as a plug-in for professional audio multi-tracking suites used in a studio setting, and as a stand-alone, rack-mounted unit for live performance processing. Auto-Tune has become standard equipment in professional recording studios.

Auto-Tune was first created by Andy Hildebrand, an engineer working for Exxon. Hildebrand developed methods for interpreting seismic data, and then realized that the technology could be used to detect, analyze, and modify pitch.

[[Baryon]]

CATEGORIES: Subatomic particles

Baryons are composite subatomic particles made of an odd number of valence quarks (at least three quarks). The most familiar baryons are the protons and neutrons which make up most of the visible matter in the universe. Electrons (the other major component of the atom) are leptons.

Since all quarks have a spin of 1/2, all baryons have a spin of 1/2 or 3/2 (the spins can cancel out). 1/2 spin baryons have the lowest energy state. 3/2 spin baryons are extremely unstable, and only live for 10-23 seconds. After that, they jump down to a lower energy state by releasing photons containing energy. These 3/2 spin baryons are known as higher energy resonances.

All particles with 1/2 spin (or 3/2 spin) are called fermions, and obey Fermi-Dirac statistics. This means that no two fermions can be in the same point in space at the same time. This is not true for the other type of subatomic particle, called a boson. More than one boson—like a photon—can exist in the same point in space at the same time. 

Baryons are one of two types of hadrons, which are particles made of quarks. The other type of hadron is called a meson.

The name baryon comes from Greek "barys," meaning heavy.

[[Upper Triassic]]

CATEGORIES: Triassic

The Upper Triassic is the last epoch in the Triassic period. It began 237 million years ago, and ended 201.3 million years ago. It came after the Middle Triassic epoch, and came before the Lower Jurassic epoch.

The other two epochs of the Triassic were the Lower Triassic epoch and the Middle Triassic epoch.

Many early dinosaur species appeared for the first time during the Upper Triassic, including Plateosaurus, Coelophysis, and Eoraptor. Pterosaurs were common in the air, and Ichthyosaurs dominated the seas.

At the end of the Upper Triassic some event or events caused the extinction of many animal species worldwide. Known as the end–Triassic extinction event, it was similar to the more famous event that lead to the extinction of the dinosaurs, except no one knows for sure what caused the event. There are many theories as to what caused the event such as meteorite impact, tsunamis, or coronal mass ejections from the sun.

[[Amoebiasis]]

CATEGORIES: Diseases caused by protozoa, Diseases and disorders of the digestive system

Amoebiasis, also known as amebiasis or entamoebiasis, is an  intestinal infection caused by  amoebas of the Entamoeba group. The infection is usually caused by Entamoeba histolytica. The infection is normally got when someone drinks water with the parasite in it.

In some cases, the parasite lives in a person's large intestine and does not cause any symptoms. Symptoms vary from serious to none at all. There may be abdominal pain, mild diarrhoea, bloody diarrhoea or severe colitis with tissue death and perforation. This last complication may cause peritonitis. People affected may develop anaemia due to loss of blood.

Amoebiasis is usually transmitted by water contaminated with faeces. It can also be got indirectly by contact with dirty hands or objects.

Infection is spread by ingesting the cyst form of the parasite. This tough and semi-dormant structure is found in faeces. Since amoebiasis is transmitted by contaminated food and water, it is often endemic in parts of the world with poor sanitation (such as México, Central America, western South America, South Asia, and western and southern Africa).

Amoebic dysentery is often confused with "traveller's diarrhoea" because of its prevalence in developing nations. In fact, most traveller's diarrhoea is bacterial or viral in origin.

E. histolytica infections occur in both the intestine and (in people with symptoms) in tissue of the intestine and/or liver. So, two different classes of drugs are needed to treat the infection, one for each location. Such anti-amoebic drugs are known as amoebicides.

"Haeundae" was so named by scholar Choi Chi-Won (857~?) of the Silla Dynasty (BC 57~AD 935). When he was walking past Dongbaekdo Island, he was fascinated by it and carved the words "Hae Un Dae" on a stone wall on the island. Haeundae is 1.5 km long, 30~50m wide, and spans an area of 58,400㎡. The white sand is rough and is rather sticky. The sand of this beach is composed of sand that comes from Chuncheon Stream and shells that have been naturally eroded by the wind over time. 

Haeundae used to be isolated from the large communities in Busan and Busanjin. However hotels, shopping centers and other tourist facilities have been constructed on the beach front area since the mid-1990s, and Haendae is now an rich beach front area. Haeundae New Town, a major commercial and residential redevelopment project begun in 1990 and another development project, Centum City, has been ongoing since early 2000 and is now a major feature of Busan. In Centum City there is the world's largest department store, Shinsegae Department Store and BEXCO (Busan Exhibition and Convention Center) has become a popular venue for international conventions and exhibitions. Nearby Marine City is built on land reclaimed from the sea, and has several huge, high-rise apartment blocks. 

Haeundae's geographical assets, along with its tourist facilities, have led to a regular role as one of the host venues for the annual Pusan International Film Festival (PIFF).  The 2005 APEC Conference was held on Haeundae's Dongbeak Island. Haeundae is one of the most popular spots in Busan to view the first sunrise of the year on January 1. Also, one of the most famous beach events happens in the first week of January when the temperature is around 0°C, the "Polar Bear Club", held by Choseon Beach Hotel since 1988.

Tanganyika is the mainland part of Tanzania. From 9 December 1961 to 26 April 1964 it was an independent state.

It was an East African territory lying between the Indian Ocean and the African Great Lakes: Lake Victoria, Lake Malawi and Lake Tanganyika.

Once part of the larger colony of German East Africa (Deutsch-Ostafrika), it comprised today's Rwanda, Burundi, and Tanzania, but not Zanzibar.

After World War I the parts that are today's Rwanda and Burundi became a League of Nations mandate governed by Belgium. The major part, however, came under British rule and was transferred to Britain under the 1919 Treaty of Versailles. This was confirmed by a League of Nations Mandate in 1922, later becoming a United Nations Trust Territory. Britain changed the name to the Tanganyika Territory.

On 9 December 1961 Tanganyika became independent as a Commonwealth Realm, and on 9 December 1962 it became the Republic of Tanganyika within the Commonwealth of Nations. In 1964, it joined with the islands of Zanzibar to form the United Republic of Tanganyika and Zanzibar, later in the year changed to the United Republic of Tanzania.

Although Tanganyika still exists within Tanzania, the name is no longer used formally for the territory. It is, however, a convenient way to refer to the mainland, which is so different geographically and culturally from Zanzibar. The name Tanganyika is also used to refer to Lake Tanganyika.

She married Philippe of France, Monsieur, brother of King Louis XIV, and became known as Madame at court. Very popular with the court, Henriette was known for her flirtatious nature which was the cause of various arguments between husband and wife. Louise de La Vallière and Madame de Montespan were part of her household prior to being Louis XIV's mistresses. Henriette was instrumental to the completion of the Secret Treaty of Dover prior to her unexpected death in June 1670. The reason for her death has never been conclusively determined; while some argue that it was by poison administered by her husband's lover the Chevalier de Lorraine, historians have also argued that she was felled by a perforated peptic ulcer.

The Jacobite claims to the throne following the death of Henry Benedict Stuart descend from her through her daughter Anne Marie, Queen of Sardinia.

[[SQR codes]]

CATEGORIES: Data input

Secure Quick Response codes or SQR codes are secure two dimensional barcodes with high data density, based on QR codes. 

Secure Quick Response codes are a secure method for encrypting data into a barcode. It makes it extremely difficult to decode into the original plain text in the absence of the encryption cipher or key. A typical implementation of SQR codes would be to create a one-time use SQR code on a mobile phone's screen to effectively create a highly secure one-time pad type of encryption of, for example, an online account number. 

A typical implementation is to encrypt and use a precursor physical machine readable token such as the card identity number (CID) written in read-only memory (ROM) of a Secure Digital microSD card contained in a mobile telephone.  The international mobile identity number may be used where no microSD card is present, for example, on an Apple iPhone. 

SQR codes may be securely read in a retail environment at the point of sale using 2D barcode scanners or even a low cost web camera. Secure Quick Response codes were first developed by Yodo, a company operating in Japan, and are patent pending.

[[Composite particle]]

CATEGORIES: Subatomic particles

Composite particles are subatomic particles that are made of more than one quark. Simple particles like protons are actually composites of multiple quarks. Protons are known as baryons, which means that they are made of exactly three quarks. Baryons are in a family called Hadrons, which simply means that they are made of quarks. The only other subcategory of Hadrons is Mesons, which are made of one quark and one antiquark. 

Since they are made of quarks, composite particles are not so much hard balls, but rather like clouds that contain these quarks. Depending on the energy contained by the quarks, the quarks of a proton vibrate, and this gives a proton a size larger than the actual size of the three quarks combined.

For more information see: subatomic particles, elementary particles, and the composite particles on the 'List of particles' wiki pages.

Some centers where computers are not available still offer this format. The second format is the CBT (computer-based TOEFL test). People are each provided with a computer to take the test. A writing section was added as well as the three sections. The level of listening and grammar skills are automatically changed depending on a person’s English level. The third change is the iBT (Internet-based test) that is being brought in around the world which measures listening, speaking, reading and writing.

take the test because the format of the test could be either iBT or CBT depending on location. People need to register 2–3 months in advance to get a place. Second is registration in person, online, by phone, or through email. Online registration is most common and payment will be required to complete the registration. The cost changes depending on what kind of exam is taken.

As more universities and colleges want a TOEFL more people are wanting to do the test. In Korea in 2010, nearly 115,000 people took the test to demonstrate their ability in English. This was 20% of the total for people doing the test. It is considered as one of the ways for middle or high school students to apply for the high ranked domestic universities.

Sometimes it is more convenient to sell to an entrepôt than to travel long distances along a trade route. The entrepôt sells the goods at a higher price to others travelling the rest of the route. In modern times customs areas have largely made such entrepôts obsolete.

This type of port should not be confused with the modern French use of the word entrepôt meaning warehouse.

[[K1A1 tank]]

CATEGORIES: Tanks, Military of South Korea

The K1A1 is a remodeled and upgraded version of K1, the main battle tank of the South Korean army. It looks similar to the K1 tank. The first test model, made by Hyundai, was shown to the public on April 3, 1996. It went through performance tests for two years from 1999 to 2001. Production began on October 13, 2001. It is planned to produce 484 of them by 2010. The K2 Black Panther is planned to replace it after that.

The reason for the upgrade was to increase the fire power of the K1. The main 105mm gun was replaced with the M256 120mm gun. The M256 122mm has 1.5 times the range and 1.7 times stronger fire power than the older gun. It also changed its armor, called Korean Special Armor Plate (KSAP), which greatly improved its side shield.

The K1A1 weighs about 53.2 tons and can seat four people. Besides the main gun, there are two kinds of machine guns, 12.7mm K6 and two 7.62mm M60s as secondary arms. Guns and a turret are able to move independently of the main body. This improves its accuracy rate.

The K1A1 is designed for Korea’s mountainous land. It provides a smoother ride as well as higher speed driving on a sloping hill, compared to the K1. The maximum speed is around 65km/h on the level ground, 40km/h on the mountains. Its fire control system involves KCPS (Korea Commander’s Panoramic Sight), KGPS (Korean Gunners Primary Sight), digital ballistic calculator, and some minor factors. The notable fact is that the development of this system was mostly done by Korean technology.

[[Photocatalysis]]

CATEGORIES: Chemistry

Photocatalysis is using light as a catalyst to increase the rate of a photoreaction.  Most known photoreactions begin when light creates a free radical in the reaction system.  Light can have a lot of energy and is able to break chemical bonds.  For example some things fade or lose their color when left in sunlight. When light breaks the chemical bonds, free radicals are produced. A free radical is a molecule, atom or an ion that needs an electron. The free radical will take electrons from other molecules or atoms and this starts chemical reactions.

[[X-ray crystallography]]

CATEGORIES: Chemistry, Physics, Technology, Molecular biology

X-ray crystallography is a way to see the three-dimensional structure of a molecule. The electron cloud of an atom bends the X-rays slightly. This makes a "picture" of the molecule that can be seen on a screen. It can be used for both organic and inorganic molecules. The sample is not destroyed in the process.

The technique was jointly invented by Sir William Bragg (1862–1942) and his son Sir Lawrence Bragg (1890–1971). They won the Nobel Prize in Physics for 1915. Lawrence Bragg is the youngest to be made a Nobel Laureate. He was the Director of the Cavendish Laboratory, Cambridge University, when the discovery of the structure of DNA was made by James D. Watson , Francis Crick , Maurice Wilkins, and Rosalind Franklin in February 1953.

The oldest method of X-ray crystallography is X-ray diffraction (XRD). X-rays are fired at a single crystal and the way they are scattered produces a pattern.  These patterns are used to work out the arrangement of atoms inside the crystal.

[[NMR spectroscopy]]

CATEGORIES: Pistol and rifle cartridges, Military cartridges

A 9x19mm Parabellum is a nine millimeter wide bullet. It is usually used in handguns or submachine guns. The nine millimeter is often referred to as a "nine", "9mm", or "9x19". It is one of the most widely used bullets in history originating with the 9x19 Luger, invented in Germany. Many guns fire the 9mm, including the Luger, Walther P38, the Sten Mk II, the MP-40, the Uzi, the MP5, the Beretta 92, and the Glock 18. It is the standard handgun bullet for all NATO countries.

[[Hamiltonian mechanics]]

CATEGORIES: Mechanics

Hamiltonian mechanics is a mathematical way of understanding the way something  mechanical will behave. It was invented  in 1833 by Irish mathematician William Rowan Hamilton.

The value of the Hamiltonian is the total energy of the thing  being described. For a closed system, it is the sum of its  kinetic and potential energy. There will be  a set of differential equations known as the Hamilton equations which show how the thing changes through time. 

Hamiltonians can be used to describe such simple systems as a bouncing ball, a pendulum or an oscillating spring in which energy changes between  kinetic and  potential energy and back again over time. Hamiltonians can also be used to study the orbits of planets and in the behaviour of atoms using the principles of quantum mechanics.

[[Na+/K+-ATPase]]

CATEGORIES: Enzymes

Na+/K+-ATPase is an enzyme found in the plasma membrane.  It is sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphatase, also known as the 'Na+/K+ pump', 'sodium-potassium pump', or simply 'sodium pump', for short. It was first discovered by Jens Christian Skou who won a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1997.

The enzyme moves Na+ (sodium) ions out of the cell and replaces them with K+ (potassium) ions. This keeps the Na+ ions outside of the cell membrane, and keeps the K+ ions on the inside of the cell membrane. The process works in the opposite direction of diffusion.

For every three sodium ions that get pumped out of the cell, two potassium ions get pumped into the cell. One phosphate group is still bound to the pump.

[[Auger electron spectroscopy]]

CATEGORIES: Spectroscopy

Auger electron spectroscopy is a way of telling what chemical elements are at the surface of an object.

When an electron is removed from a core level of an atom, a higher energy level electron may fall in the vacancy. If the energy released by the fall is transferred to another electron, the latter (called Auger electron) will be emitted from the atom, in what is called the Auger effect, after the French physicist who discovered the phenomenon, Pierre Auger. The kinetic energy levels of the Auger electrons depend on the type of the atoms from which the electrons were ejected, and the chemical environment of the atoms. AES consists of bombarding a sample with energetic electrons and measuring the energy of the Auger electrons, obtaining a spectra that can be used to get information about the identity and environment of the emitting atoms.

[[Puzzle Bobble 2]]

CATEGORIES: 1995 video games, Arcade games, Game Boy games, Nintendo 64 games, PlayStation games, Puzzle video games, Sega Saturn games, Video games developed in Japan, Windows games

Bust-A-Move 2 is the first sequel to Bust-A-Move, and is also known as Puzzle Bobble 2 outside Europe and North America. Released into the arcades in 1995, PlayStation, Sega Saturn, Nintendo 64 and PC conversions followed. The game was included in Taito Legends 2, but the US arcade version was included on US PS2 version instead. The game is a spin-off from Bubble Bobble.

The game builds on the original by adding a tournament style variation on the two player game for play against the computer and by adding a branching map to the one player game, allowing the player to periodically select one of two groups of five levels to play next, leading to different game endings. Some of the contestants in the new tournament mode are based on characters from Bubble Bobble, including variations on a Monsta and a Mighta.

Some versions of the game, including the PlayStation, feature time trial competitions in which a single player attempts to finish simple rounds quickly enough to beat previous time records or two players simultaneously attempt to beat the records and each other.

Completion of the single player game gives the player a code which can be entered to unlock 'Another World' for the single player game, which features subtle changes to the existing levels to increase their difficulty and changes to all backdrops to resemble levels from Bubble Bobble. The various enemies from Bubble Bobble also make an appearance in the background of the credits sequence.

J/ψ mesons (pronounced jeɪ/saɪ, English jay/sigh) are subatomic particles made of one charm quark and one charm antiquark. Mesons are a family of composite particles which are made of one quark and one antiquark. It was discovered by Burton Richter. The discovery of J/ψ mesons was huge because it revealed the existence of the fourth known quark of the time, the charm quark. J/ψ mesons were used in an attempt to learn more about quark-gluon plasmas, but no conclusive results were found. The name J/ψ comes from the chosen names from the two labs that found them, one of which chose the letter J, while the other chose the Greek letter ψ (psi).

[[Pion]]

CATEGORIES: Subatomic particles

A pion or π meson is a meson, which is a subatomic particle made of one quark and one antiquark.

There are six types of quark (called flavours) but only two flavours go together to make a pion. These flavours are called up and down. Quarks have charge, so two quarks of the same flavour (both up or both down) make a neutral pion. But when the two quarks have different flavours (up and down), the pion will have a charge. This charge is positive when an up quark pairs with a down antiquark. The charge is negative when a down quark pairs with an up antiquark.

Pions do not exist for a long time. (On average, charged pions exist for around 26 nanoseconds; neutral pions last a tiny fraction of this). Pions are significant to our lives because they are one of the ways for strong force interactions to take place between nucleons like the protons and neutrons of ordinary matter. These interactions hold the nucleus together.

Pions are the lightest hadrons (particles made up of quarks) and pions with a positive or negative charge are the mesons with the longest mean lifetime (the average time that passes before they decay into leptons). 

[[Labyrinthodont]]

CATEGORIES: Fossils, Amphibians

Labyrinthodont is a term which was used for fossil amphibia. Although it is no longer a formal term in taxonomy, it is still useful as an evolutionary grade, a kind of catch-all term. Labyrinth mean a maze and dont means tooth.

Labyrinthodonts are often called Temnospondyls.

The Labyrinthodontia is not a clade, because it is not monophyletic. It has been replaced in the classification by more correct terms.

The labyrithodonts were some of the dominant animals from the Devonian to the Lower Triassic (about 390 to 210 million years ago). The group is an evolutionary grade (a polyphyletic or paraphyletic group) of species which look rather similar.

The name describes the pattern of infolding of the dentine and enamel of the teeth, which often fossilise. They are also have a heavily armoured skull roof (so they also have an even older name "Stegocephalia"), and complex vertebrae.

[[Tau lepton]]

CATEGORIES: Elementary particles

Tau (τ) leptons (aka tauons, tau particle) are one of the very small elementary particles. This means that they are believed to be so small that they can not be divided any more. Tau leptons can be thought of as very heavy electrons, as they are both leptons. This is because they have about 3,500 times as much mass as electrons, and about 17 times as much mass as muons. Since they only live for 2.9x10–13 seconds, they do not have a significant role in the regular world. However, they are very important in the decay of subatomic matter.

Like the other two basic leptons, tauons have a neutrino named after them (the tau neutrino).

Tau have a charge of -1, and can be written as τ–. Since antimatter has the opposite of charge of regular matter, anti-tauons have a charge of +1, and can be written as τ+. Tauons themselves are unstable, and can decay. Also, τ+ and τ– can annihilate each other in a form of decay. When a single tauon decays, it is the only lepton that can decay into hadrons (things made of quarks). τ+ and τ– can be formed by an electron-positron (antielectron) pair combining. The two tauons then decay into an electron and a positron or a muon and an antimuon, and four of the various neutrinos. However, a single tauon decays differently than a tauon and an antitauon.

A τ– will quickly decay into a tau neutrino and a W boson. The W boson will exist for 3x10–25 seconds, before it decays into an electron and an electron antineutrino, a muon and a muon antineutrino, or a down quark and an up antiquark.

Julian Paul Assange (born 3 July 1971) is an Australian computer programmer, publisher and journalist. He is a spokesman and editor-in-chief of WikiLeaks, which is a website that posts news leaks. He started the website in 2006. He was born in Townsville, Queensland. He also made a program called Rubberhose (file system) to hide secret information in a specific way that protects against torture.

Assange was the Readers' Choice for Time Person of the Year in 2010 after getting the most Internet votes. However, Mark Zuckerberg, who started Facebook, won the actual award.

In 2012, facing extradition to Sweden, he was granted political asylum by Ecuador and took refuge at the Embassy of Ecuador, London.

On 11 January 2018, it was announced that Assange had held Ecuadorian citizenship since 12 December 2017.

Ecuadorian President Lenín Moreno said on 27 July 2018 that he had begun talks with British authorities to withdraw the asylum for Assange. On 11 April 2019, Ecuador withdrew Assange's asylum and he was arrested by the Metropolitan Police shortly afterwards. His lawyers said they will fight extradition to the United States 

In November 2019, it was reported that Assange is in bad health, has depression and "could die in prison" if not hospitalized.

The extradition to the United States hearing for Assange began in London on February 24,  2020. The next set of hearings is scheduled for May.

[[Kaon]]

CATEGORIES: Subatomic particles

Kaons are a specific type of meson (mesons are particles made of one quark and one antiquark). What makes kaons unique is that they are made of one up quark or down quark, and one strange quark. (One of the two quarks that make of a kaon must be an antiquark, and the other must be normal matter. For example, a kaon can be made of one up quark and a strange antiquark). The discovery of kaons was significant because it proved the existence of yet another flavour (type) of quark, the strange quark.

There are four types of kaons, but two of them are relatively easy to understand. There is the K+ and the K0. The + and 0 above the letter K refer to whether the charge is positive, or 0 (neutral). The K+ is made of one up quark, and one strange antiquark. Since antiparticles have the opposite charge of their counterpart (and since normal strange quarks have a charge of -1/3), 2/3 + 1/3 = a +1 charge, or simply a + charge. (Also because antiparticles have the opposite charge of their counterpart, if you change the up quark in a K+ to an up antiquark and the strange antiquark to a normal strange quark, you get the opposite charge, forming a K–). Since down quarks and strange quarks have the same charge, if either one of them is an antiparticle, the overall charge is zero. Therefore, a K0 can either be made of one down quark and  strange antiquark, or one down antiquark and one normal strange quark.

Edward Drinker Cope (July 28, 1840 – April 12, 1897) was an American biologist. He was notable for his work on fossil animals of North America. Cope was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Cope was a paleontologist, comparative anatomist, herpetologist and ichthyologist. He wrote many papers. His parents were rich Quakers.

His father wanted him to be a farmer, but he became a scientist. He married his cousin. Later, they owned a museum in Philadelphia.

Mostly, he read books on his own to learn science and found things out himself. He was not a teacher. He did field work, and wrote a lot. In the 1870s and 1880s, went to the American West to report what the land was like to the government. He was often on a mapping team sent by the United States Geological Survey.

For a while he and Othniel Charles Marsh were competing to find dinosaurs. This fight between them is called the Bone Wars. Sometimes being a scientist cost him more money than he could afford. In the 1880s, Cope lost so much money in his silver mines that he had to sell a lot of his fossil collection in 1886. In the 1890s he was no longer poor, but he died when he was only 57.

1,400 of his articles were published in science journals. He found over 1,000 species of extinct animals. He wrote about hundreds of kinds of ancient fish. He found dozens of dinosaurs. He wrote about the evolution of mammalian  molars teeth, and produced two huge works on the amphibia and reptiles of North America.

Cope showed that horses evolved to be larger as they moved from woodland onto grassland. The fact that the fossils show the mammals getting bigger over time is called Cope's rule.

[[National Science Foundation]]

CATEGORIES: Research organizations in the United States, United States government agencies, 1950 establishments in the United States, 1950s establishments in Virginia

The National Science Foundation (NSF) is a United States government agency where discoveries begin and supports fundamental research and education in all the non-medical fields of science and engineering. Its medical counterpart is the National Institutes of Health. With an annual budget of about US$6.87 billion (fiscal year 2010), the NSF funds approximately 20 percent of all federally supported basic research conducted by the United States' colleges and universities. In some fields, such as mathematics, computer science, economics and the social sciences, the NSF is the major source of federal backing.

The NSF's director, deputy director, and the 24 members of the National Science Board (NSB) are appointed by the President of the United States, and confirmed by the United States Senate. The director and deputy director are responsible for administration, planning, budgeting and day-to-day operations of the foundation, while the NSB meets six times a year to establish its overall policies.

He discovered that some massive stars, known as runaways, can be moving at speeds of hundreds of kilometers per second. He was the scientific director of the European Southern Observatory and later became it's Director General. From 1976 to 1979 he was the President of the International Astronomical Union.

[[Drosophila pseudoobscura]]

CATEGORIES: Drosophila, Evolutionary biology, Experiments, Model organisms

Drosophila pseudoobscura is a species of fruit fly, used extensively in lab studies of the genetics of natural populations.

It was first used by Theodosius Dobzhansky and his colleagues. They collected samples from populations in western North America and Mexico, and grew them in 'population cages' in the laboratory. They were interested in natural selection, genetic drift, and other aspects of population genetics.

In 1989 Diane Dodd gave laboratory populations of D. pseudoobscura two different food types, starch and maltose. They rapidly evolved into two distinct groups after only eight generations with the different foods. As the two groups both showed a strong preference for mating with their own type, this was claimed as an example of speciation by reproductive isolation. Dodd's experiment has been repeated by others, and works with other kinds of fruit flies and foods.

In 2005, D. pseudoobscura was the second Drosophila species to have its genome sequenced, after Drosophila melanogaster.

[[Time Person of the Year]]

CATEGORIES: Time People of the Year

Person of the Year is an issue of the United States magazine Time that has come out each year since 1927.  Until 1999, it was called "Man of the Year."

The "Person of the Year" is not always a person.  It can be a person, group, idea, or thing that "for better or for worse...has done the most to influence the events of the year".  This means that being chosen is not an award, like being chosen as the "best person of the year."  The Person of the Year may be an enemy of the United States, like Adolf Hitler (1938) or Joseph Stalin (1939 and 1942).  Every year, Time chooses the person who they think has had the most effect on the things that have happened in that year (whether those things were good or bad).

The first Person of the Year was aviator Charles Lindbergh, in 1927.  Since then, Persons of the Year have included groups, whole generations, important objects, and even the Earth.  Since the list began, every serving President of the United States has been a Person of the Year at least once, except for Calvin Coolidge, Herbert Hoover, and Gerald Ford.  Franklin D. Roosevelt is the only person to have been named Person of the Year three times.

The December 31, 1999 issue of Time named Albert Einstein the "Person of the Century". Franklin D. Roosevelt and Mahatma Gandhi were chosen as runners-up.

[[Up quark]]

CATEGORIES: Quarks

Up quarks are subatomic particles that help make up many larger particles, like protons. Up quarks have a charge of +2/3, and are the lightest of the six types (flavours) of quarks. Like all fermions (non force-carrying particles), up quarks have a spin of 1/2. They are affected by all four of the fundamental forces, which are gravity, the strong force, the weak force, and electromagnetism. Like all quarks, Up quarks are elementary particles, which means that they are so small that scientists believe that they can not be divided any more.

Protons (which have a total charge of +1) are made of two up quarks (which have a charge of +2/3) and one down quark (which have a charge of -1/3). Neutrons (which have a total charge of 0) are made of one up quark, and two down quarks. Up quarks can also be used to create more complex particles, such as pions.

[[Gorgonopsid]]

CATEGORIES: Therapsids, Fossils

The Gorgonopsids  were Therapsids, a group of tetrapods which eventually gave rise to the mammals.

Gorgonopsids were a successful group which lived during the Permian period, about 260 million years ago. They became extinct in the Permian–Triassic extinction event. 

They were the major predators of their day. They had large, powerful, square-shaped jaws with huge, sabre-like canine and interlaced, socket-like teeth. Many fossils have been found in South Africa.

The largest known, Inostrancevia, was the size of a large bear with a 45 cm long skull, and 12-cm long sabre-like teeth.  

The Gorgonopsidae are divided into three sub-families: 

[[Gorgonops]]

CATEGORIES: Theriodonts

Gorgonops (literally "Gorgon' face") is the name given to an extinct genus of therapsid which lived about 255-250 million years ago, during the latest part of the Permian period. It was a typical representative of the Gorgonopsia, the dominant predators of their day, which in the largest forms grew to over four meters long. 

[[Down quark]]

CATEGORIES: Quarks

Down quarks (sometimes written as a "d") are very small particles that help make up many larger particles, like protons and neutrons. Down quarks have a charge of -1/3. Since Down quarks are fermions (which means that no two of them can exist in the same space at the same time), they have a spin of 1/2. Down quarks are the second lightest quark, the first being up quarks.

The antiparticle of a Down quark is a Down antiquark, or simply an antidown.

[[Strange quark]]

CATEGORIES: Quarks

Strange quarks are the third lightest quarks, which are subatomic particles that are so small, they are believed to be the fundamental particles, and not further divisible. Like down quarks, strange quarks have a charge of -1/3. Like all fermions (which are particles that can not exist in the same place at the same time), strange quarks have a spin of 1/2. What makes strange quarks different from down quarks–apart from having 25 times the mass of down quarks–is that they have something that scientists call "strangeness." Strangeness is basically a resistance to decay against strong force and electromagnetism. This means that any particle that contains a strange quark can not decay due to strong force (or electromagnetism), but instead with the much slower weak force. It was believed that this was a 'strange' method of decay, which is why the scientists gave the particles that name.

Strange quarks can be found in particles such as kaons and some hyperons. Scientists began noticing strangeness when these particles did not decay as quickly as their masses would have suggested they would have. However, it took them a long time to even guess strangeness was the answer because it took over 16 years to predict it after the discovery of kaons.

[[Charm quark]]

CATEGORIES: Quarks

Charm quarks or c quarks are the third most massive of the six quarks. Like all quarks, they are thought to be so small that they can not be divided. (They are called elementary particles for this reason). Similar to up quarks, charm quarks have a charge of +2/3. Although charm quarks are not extremely common, they can be found in particles created by particle accelerators (which smash atoms together at extremely high speeds), such as J/ψ mesons, D mesons, and other charmed particles. Since they are fermions (particles that can not have more than one of that particle at the same place at the same time), charm quarks have a spin of 1/2. 

The discovery of charm quarks – and J/ψ mesons – led to a rapid series of scientific breakthroughs. These events are known as the November revolution.

[[Web application]]

CATEGORIES: Software, Computer science

A web application is a software application that can be run without being installed on the client and that has several parts: A part of it will run on the remote web server, another part will run on the client, usually inside a web browser. Both parts communicate over a computer network, for example the internet. The protocol they often use is  called HTTP. This kind of application design is called client-server model. The parts are usually called "tiers". The most common kind is a three-tier application: One tier is called Presentation tier, another is called Application tier, and the third is called Storage tier. Common examples of web applications are those used for web mail, or for online banking. Social media sites, such as Wikipedia are also web applications.  

[[Boron group]]

CATEGORIES: Periodic table

The boron group, also known as Group III and Group 13, is a group of elements on the periodic table. Most of its members are poor metals, except for boron. Boron is a semimetal. The rest of the elements are soft metals.

[[Bottom quark]]

CATEGORIES: Quarks

Bottom quarks or beauty quarks are the second most massive of the elementary particles (particles that are so small that they can not be divided any more). All quarks are elementary particles. Bottom quarks have a charge of -1/3, similar to down quarks. Although bottom quarks are not very common, they are found in particles such as B mesons, among others. All bottom quarks will decay into charm quarks or up quarks in about 10–12, due to weak force.

[[Top quark]]

CATEGORIES: Quarks

Top quarks or truth quarks are the heaviest known elementary particles (particles that are so small that they can not be divided). All quarks are elementary particles, and since they are fermions (which means that no two of them can exist in the same place at the same time), they have a spin of 1/2. Top quarks interact with all four of the fundamental forces, which are gravity, electromagnetism, strong force, and weak force. Almost all of the time, top quarks will decay into a bottom quark and a W boson, although it can sometimes decay into a strange quark.

One top quark weighs about as much as one atom of tungsten. Since top quarks are so massive, scientists have been able to make predictions about the mass of the theoretical particle known as a Higgs Boson. Unfortunately, top quarks are only believed to be able to exist for 5x10–25 seconds.

[[Gauge boson]]

CATEGORIES: Elementary particles

Gauge bosons are carrier particles for three of the four fundamental forces. In the Standard Model of particle physics, there are four kinds of gauge bosons. The three gauge bosons are as follows:

The only remaining fundamental force that has no known gauge boson is gravity. The theoretical gauge boson for gravity is called a graviton.

All gauge bosons are bosons, which simply means that two or more of them can exist in the same place at the same time, unlike fermions. It also means that gauge bosons have a spin of 0, 1, or 2. 

Gauge bosons are thought to interact with the Higgs field. This theoretical field is believed by many scientists to be responsible for why some gauge bosons – like W and Z bosons – have mass, while others – such as photons – do not have mass.

[[Hyperon]]

CATEGORIES: Quantum mechanics, Subatomic particles

Hyperons are particles that are made of quarks. What makes them different from other baryons (particles made of three quarks) is that they must have at least one strange quark, but no charm quarks or bottom quarks. Strange quarks have a property known as strangeness. Strangeness causes the strange quark–and all other particles bonded with it–to not decay by strong force, but instead due to the much slower weak force. Since all quarks are fermions (which means that no two of them can be in the same point in space at the same point in time), each quark has a spin of 1/2, adding up to a total spin of 3/2 for a hyperon. This quickly decays into a 1/2 spin particle.

Hyperons themselves decay due to weak force. There are dozens of different hyperon combinations. For example, a Λ (lambda) hyperon has a charge of 0, and is often written as Λ0. When it decays, it usually creates one proton, and one antipion. Like many forms of weak force decay, there is more than one possible outcome. A Λ0 also has a significantly lower, but still possible, chance to decay into a neutron and an uncharged pion. Λ0 hyperons have an average lifespan of 2.6x10−10 seconds, which makes it one of the longest living hyperons.

Scientists still study hyperons in labs across the world, such as CERN, Fermilab, and SLAC. Hyperons provide answers questions for problems such as CP Violation, in which symmetries that were believed to be true may not be true.

Herbert Gasser (Herbert Spencer Gasser, July 5, 1888  May 11, 1963) was an American doctor. He won the 1944 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, with Joseph Erlanger.

Gasser discovered the different conductivity rates of different groups of nerve fibres. The work led to advances in our knowledge of the mechanism of pain and of reflex action and has inspired a large school of neurophysiologists. The Nobel Foundation described their work as "for their discoveries relating to the highly differentiated functions of single nerve fibres" which probably means 'different fibres do different things'.

[[Pseudopodia]]

CATEGORIES: Cell biology

Pseudopodia  are temporary and cytoplasm-filled parts of the cell membrane that are able to change their form in order to move. They are used in some eukaryotic cells to move around or to eat. Most cells that do this are called amoeboids. The amoeba is a common example.

The cell wall makes a network of fibers. The cytoplasm flows into the network and fills it up, similar to a net filled with gelatin. This is able to move, lengthen, or shorten. The pseudopodia extends from the amoeba. Then the main part of the amoeba flows into that pseudopodia and the amoeba has changed its place.

Pseudopods are one of the three locomotion modes of unicellular organisms (together with flagella and cilia). Pseudopods can also capture prey by phagocytosis. Pseudopedia are used by some cells to move around. They can detect food and place it inside the cell. The human white blood cell uses this way to get around.

Pseudopods can be classified into several varieties according to their appearance:

The Wild Bunch's sound used a lot of different musical styles - an unusual thing at the time. Their shows included parts of punk, R&B and reggae, with a use on slower rhythms and ambient electronic music that would become a start of the Bristol sound, more popularly known as trip-hop. They were a key member of what became the Bristol underground scene.

The Wild Bunch is perhaps best known for having been the first group of several notable British DJs and performers:

[[End-Triassic extinction event]]

CATEGORIES: Extinction events, Mesozoic

The End-Triassic extinction event marks the boundary between the Triassic and Jurassic periods, 208 million years ago. However, many of the extinctions occurred before then in the Upper Triassic.

Overall, this was one of the major extinction events of the Phanerozoic eon. It profoundly affected life on land and in the oceans. At least half of the species now known to have been living on Earth at that time went extinct. 

A whole class (conodonts: extinct chordates); 20% of all marine families; all large crurotarsans (non-dinosaurian archosaurs); some remaining therapsids; and many of the large amphibians such as the temnospondyls were wiped out. 

The event emptied many ecological niches, and allowed the dinosaurs to assume the dominant roles in the Jurassic period. This event happened in less than 10,000 years, and occurred just before Pangaea started to break apart. 

Scientists have suggested several explanations for this event, but all have unanswered challenges:

CATEGORIES: Dromaeosauridae, Mongolia, Cretaceous dinosaurs

Mahakala  is a dromaeosaurid dinosaur from the Upper Cretaceous of  80 million years ago. 

It is based on a partial skeleton found in the Gobi Desert, Mongolia. 

Mahakala was a small dromaeosaur, about 70 centimeters long (28 in). Its skeleton shows some features which are also found in early troodontids and avialans. However, its short forearms rule it out of the Alialae.

Despite its late appearance, its structure is that of a basal dromaeosaur. Its small size, and the small size of other basal deinonychosauria, suggests that small size came before flight in birds.

[[Telephone (song)]]

CATEGORIES: 2010 songs, Beyoncé songs, Lady Gaga songs, Dance-pop songs

"Telephone" is a song by American singer Lady Gaga from her third EP The Fame Monster, featuring American R&B singer Beyoncé Knowles. The main inspiration of the song was Gaga's fear of not being able to enjoy herself because of her career, hence the lyrics show the singer as wanting the dance floor, rather than answering her lover's phone calls.

Gaga explained that the telephone addressed in the lyrics of the song, is in reality a person telling her to continue working harder. Musically, the song is made of an expanded bridge, verse-rap and an epilogue, where the voice of an operator says that the phone line is not reachable. Knowles appears in the middle of the song, singing the verses in a rapid-fire way, accompanied by double beats.

"Telephone" was appreciated by contemporary critics who many times noted it as a stand-out track from The Fame Monster.  The song was nominated for a Grammy Award in 2011 for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals.

[[Flavivirus]]

CATEGORIES: Viruses

Flavivirus is a genus of the family Flaviviridae. This genus includes the West Nile virus, dengue fever virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, yellow fever virus, Zika virus, and several other viruses which may cause encephalitis (swelling in the brain).

Flaviviruses are named for the yellow fever virus - "flavus" means "yellow" in Latin.  (Yellow fever was named because it often caused yellow-colored skin, called jaundice, in its victims.)

Flaviviruses share a common size (40-65 nm) and symmetry (shape), and they look similar under an electron microscope.  They are made of single-stranded RNA.

Humans get these viruses after being bitten by an infected mosquito or tick.  Usually, if a human who has a Flavivirus gets bitten by a healthy mosquito or tick, the human will not have enough of the virus in their blood to infect the insect.  This means humans do not help continue the virus's life cycle (by infecting insects who go on to infect other people).  However, this is not true for yellow fever or dengue fever.

People can also get Flaviviruses in other ways, like:

It is not likely that animals can spread Flaviviruses directly to humans.  Scientists believe that an mosquito or tick has to bite an infected animal before it can spread the virus to a human by biting that human.  This means that Flaviviruses are probably not contagious diseases.  For example, early tests with yellow fever showed that the disease is not a contagious disease.

[[Cytomegalovirus]]

Cytomegalovirus (which means "Large Cell", when translated from Greek cyto-, "cell", and -megalo-, "large") is a Virus which people get. It's a Herpesvirus and is usually called HCMV (Human Cytomegalovirus) or Human Herpesvirus 5 (HHV-5).

As with all herpesviruses, even without symptoms, the virus can still be in a person for long periods of time, even for life.

Two out of five people in the world have HCMV. More people in developed countries, such as the United States and the United Kingdom, have the condition. In these places, more than half of people have the condition.

There is no treatment or cure, but scientists in the United States are developing vaccines, but none has proven to work fully yet.

[[Category theory]]

CATEGORIES: Mathematics

Category theory is a type of mathematics.  Category theorists show how different ideas in mathematics are alike. For example, some ideas from topology and abstract algebra are similar. Ideas in category theory are written down in formulas or diagrams. Category theory can be used to make computer programs more secure or easy to write.

A category is a mathematical object. It can be drawn with dots and arrows. Each arrow goes from one dot to one other dot. There can be many dots, sometimes so many that you cannot count them. An arrow is the abstract idea of a function and the dots are the domain and codomain of the function.

Composition is a way to make a new arrow out of two arrows.  If two arrows form an elbow shape, then they have a composition arrow from the start of the first to the end of the second. Composition obeys some axioms, or equations.

Many ideas in abstract algebra are examples of categories or can be used to make categories.  Often, this makes the ideas seem more similar.

[[Quango]]

CATEGORIES: Acronyms, Government, Politics

Quango is an acronym used especially in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. Quangos are arms-length bodies funded by government departments but not run by them. They are given power and paid for by government departments. 

They were invented because most government departments do two rather different jobs. One is to make policy about how the country should be run, as indicated by laws passed in Parliament. This is called administration. Their other task is to run or operate the policies in action. Examples would be: to run the prison system, to collect taxes, to guard the country's borders, and so on. Quangos were invented to do the second type of task. They are supposed to do some practical job better than a government department could. Of course, if they fail, the fault is theirs, rather than the government department's. 

The acronym QUANGO is spelt out in various ways:

• quasi non-governmental organisation,

• quasi-autonomous non-governmental organisation, 

• quasi-autonomous national government organisation 

• In the United Kingdom the official term is non-departmental public body or NDPB.

Jundallah (or Jondallah, translates to Soldiers of God), or People's resistance movement of Iran (PRMI) is a militant organisation based in Balochistan. The organisation claims to be fighting for the rights of Sunni muslims in Iran. Most muslims in Iran are Shi'a, Sunni make up for the largest group that is not Shi'a. Iran says the group is a terrorist organisation. Iran has blamed the organisation for many acts of smuggling illegal drugs, and of kidnapping. The organisation is believed to have 1.000 fighting soldiers.

Many observers believe the group is linked to al-Qaeda.  For a long time, Iran has believed that the U.S. government supported Jundallah. Several other sources such as the ABC News, Daily Telegraph, and journalist Seymour Hersh have also reported that Jundullah has received support from the United States against the government of Iran, although the US denies any involvement.

In August 2007, the Israeli Mossad chief, Meir Dagan, pushed for using ethnic groups (among others, people from Balochistan) in Iran to make the Iranian government weaker and try to change the people in charge of the government.

thumb|220px|People protest outside the house in Solingen The Solingen arson attack of 1993 happened on the night of 29 May 1993 when five Turkish people were killed in Solingen, Germany. They died when four young German men, belonging to the political far right, firebombed a house. The dead were women and children, aged four, nine, 12, 18 and 27, all of whom who were related.

The attack caused many protests in Germany, and many German government officials were at a memorial service for the dead.  Some of the protests were violent, but others were peaceful.

Because of the attack, Germany decided to make sure fewer people from other countries came into Germany for political asylum. It also banned some right-wing political groups.

On 14 October 1995, a German court sentenced the four people who did the attack. Three men, aged 18, 19 and 22, were given prison terms of ten years. The fourth man, 25, was given a term of 15 years.

CATEGORIES: Extremophiles

Hyperthermophiles are extremophile organisms that live best in very hot environments– from 60°C (140°F) up to 100°C (212°F). The best temperature for hyperthermophiles to grow at is around 80°C (176°F). Hyperthermophiles are mostly in the Archaea domain, but some bacteria are able to tolerate temperatures of around 100°C (212°F) as well. Many hyperthermophiles are also able to tolerate other environmental extremes, like high acidity or radiation levels.

[[Solder]]

CATEGORIES: Electronics, Alloys

Solder is a metal or alloy that melts at a low temperature. There are two types of solder; soft solder and hard solder. Soft solder melts easily with soldering irons and is used for electronics and electrical work. Hard solder melts at a higher temperature with a torch. Using solder is called soldering. 

There are two main types of soft solder; lead solder and lead-free solder. Lead solders have about 60% (or 63%) tin and 40% (or 37%) lead in them. They are toxic because they have lead in them. They melt at around 185°C. Lead solder is cheap, so it used to be popular. In plumbing, a 50% tin and 50% lead mixture was used. People thought this was safe, but then they saw that the lead was coming into the water. Now lead solder is illegal for water. Lead solder was once used for food cans. After many years, the lead could come into the food. The cans poisoned people who ate the food. Lead solder is still used in electronics.

In 2006 the European Union, China, and California banned lead in consumer products. Lead solder became illegal in electronic devices in some places. Lead-free solder was needed. Many lead-free solders have tin, silver, and copper in them. They melt around 217°C. Sometimes indium is added to the solder to make it better, but indium is very expensive.

Many times when a metal is being soldered, it oxidizes, making a layer of metal oxide that does not hold solder. Flux is added to react with the metal oxide and turn it back into the metal again. That helps the solder connect to the metal. Rosin is a common flux. Some electronics makers use fluxes that can be washed away with water. Some solders have a flux core, where the flux is inside the solder.

Another type of solder is used to connect glass to other things. They melt around 450-550°C.

[[Frame-dragging]]

CATEGORIES: Nuclear physics, Quantum mechanics

Frame dragging is a theory which says that space is elastic, and particles in it will exchange energy with it. In the scientific world, "elastic" means that when you apply a certain amount of force to an object (which will cause it to bend) and then remove the force, the object will return to its original shape and energy state. Also, space is referred to as spacetime, which is simply a way to bring together the concepts of space and time. This basically means that whenever space is affected, time is affected. Frame dragging would provide answers for very old questions about gravity, strong force,  and wave-particle duality (how things like electrons can act like waves and particles at the same time).

[[Blue Lines]]

CATEGORIES: Massive Attack albums, Trip hop albums

Blue Lines is the first album by British electronica group Massive Attack, released on 8 April 1991 (see 1991 in music) by Virgin Records.

Blue Lines is usually considered the first trip hop album, although the term was not used commonly until years later. The album was a success in the United Kingdom, reaching #13 in the albums chart; sales were limited elsewhere. A mix of electronic music, hip hop, dub music, '70s soul music and reggae, the album established Massive Attack as one of the most best British bands of the 1990s and the founder of trip hop's Bristol Sound. Music critic Simon Reynolds stated that the album also marked a change in electronic/dance music, "a shift toward a more interior, meditational sound. The songs on Blue Lines run at 'spliff' tempos – from a mellow, moonwalking 90 beats per minute ...down to a positively torpid 67 bpm." The group also drew inspiration from concept albums in various genres by artists such as Pink Floyd, Public Image Ltd., Billy Cobham, Herbie Hancock and Isaac Hayes.

Blue Lines featured breakbeats, sampling, and rapping on a number of tracks, but the design of the album differed from common hip hop. Massive Attack approached the American-born hip hop movement from an underground British perspective, as well as incorporating live instruments into the mixes. It features the vocals of Shara Nelson and Horace Andy, along with the rapping of Tricky Kid. Blue Lines proved to be popular in the club scene, as well as on college radio stations.

Daddy G said about the making of the album:

Arsenate is an ion. Its chemical formula is AsO43-. It has arsenic in its +5 oxidation state. 

Arsenates are salts of arsenic acid. They are oxidizing agents. Sometimes, not all of the protons are taken away from the arsenic acid and then hydrogen arsenate salts are formed. Their chemical formulas are HAsO42- or H2AsO4-. 

Arsenate can replace phosphate in the cells but it does not work like a phosphate does. The cell dies, and that is why arsenates are toxic. Some bacteria can use arsenate instead of phosphate, though. They are called arsenic bacteria.

[[Clastic rock]]

CATEGORIES: Sedimentary rocks

Clastic rocks are composed of fragments, or clasts, of pre-existing rock.

Although, in principle, almost any rock made of eroded former rock is clastic (such as sandstone or mudstone), in practice the term is used for clasts of at least gravel size upwards. That means clasts are at least visible to the naked eye, and may be huge.

There are two types of clastic rock, by shape. conglomerates have rounded clasts, and breccias have jagged clasts.

In a clastic rock, the clasts are often of a different make-up from the ground rock or matrix.

And we are different from the Muslim Brotherhood because sometimes they do not oppose the government".

The organization's original main goal was to overthrow the Egyptian government and replace it with an Islamic state based on the way it thought Islam should be. Later it broadened its aims to include attacking the United States and Israel, and other interests in Egypt and abroad.

Islamic Jihad was responsible for the assassination of Anwar Sadat in 1981. Sadat's Sinai treaty with Israel, which recognized the Jewish state, made them very angry.

[[No Protection]]

CATEGORIES: Massive Attack albums, 1995 albums, Trip hop albums

No Protection is the name of a dub remix of Massive Attack's second album Protection.  The remix was done by the British dub producer Mad Professor.  Mad Professor was contacted by Massive Attack after Protection was released to remix a song for a single.  After the single was remixed, the band asked Mad Professor to listen to more of the album to find the possibility of more remixes.  The project then became a track by track remix of almost the entire album. Mad Professor heavily edited the original material to form a slow, pulsating mix in which the beat is emphasized, reverb is extensively used and the occasional vocals (many of the tracks are almost entirely instrumental) fade in-and-out in normal dub fashion, making a hypnotic, if hi

nice

repetitive, mix. The result is, on paper, more textured than the original, but loses any sense of the jazzy feel of Protection.

[[Confuciusornis]]

CATEGORIES: Cretaceous birds, Fossils

Confuciusornis is a genus of primitive crow-sized birds from the Lower Cretaceous. It was found in the Yixian and Jiufotang Formations of China, dating from 125 to 120 million years ago. The bird was named after the Chinese moral philosopher Confucius (551–479 BC).

Like modern birds, Confuciusornis had a toothless beak, but close relatives of modern birds such as Hesperornis and Ichthyornis were toothed. This shows that the loss of teeth occurred more than once, in Confuciusornis and in ancestors of modern birds. This is an example of convergent evolution.

Confuciusornis is the oldest known bird to have a beak. It is also the first known bird to have lost the long tail of Archaeopteryx and develop fused tail vertebrae (a pygostyle).

Confuciusornis is one of the most abundant vertebrates found in the Yixian Formation, and several hundred complete, articulated specimens have been found.

The proportions of the toes suggest that they were used for both walking and perching, while the large claws of the thumb and third finger were probably used for climbing. The head probably had a small crest or tuft.

It also has their written ideas of how the capitalist society of their time would be replaced by dictatorship of the proletariat, and after that, communism. Especially by the abolition of private property and child labour and by making means of production common, strong progressive income tax and free education for all.

[[Giovanni da Verrazzano]]

CATEGORIES: 1485 births, 1528 deaths, Italian explorers

Giovanni da Verrazzano (1485 – 1528) was a Florentine explorer of North America. He is known for being the first European since the Norse colonization of the Americas around 1000 to explore the east coast of North America between South and North Carolina and Newfoundland, including New York Harbor and Narragansett Bay in 1524. The Verrazano-Narrows Bridge is named for him.  

He was chosen in 1524 by the King of France to search for a “Northwest Passage” to Asia through North America.

He left in the January of 1524, and reached Cape Fear in North Carolina on March 1, 1524.

He then proceeded north to explore the coastline, and believed that he had seen the Pacific Ocean (he explored North Carolina coast on the other side of a narrow piece of land). He actually discovered the Pamlico Sound, which is part of the Atlantic Ocean.

Verrazzano’s mistake meant that incorrect maps were printed in Europe. 

These maps showed North America as split into two parts, connected by a narrow strip of land. This error took over a century to correct.

Verrazzano discovered New York Harbor, Block Island and Narragansett bay while exploring the Atlantic coast of North America.

However, he missed some important discoveries because he often anchored far off-shore.

He sailed further north to Maine and Newfoundland, and then returned to France with his discoveries.

He made two more trips to the Americas after that.

There are conflicting reports on how he died. One version says he was killed and eaten by natives on Guadalupe Island. Another says he was executed for piracy in Spain.

New York Harbor’s Verrazano Narrows Bridge commemorates this journey and his discoveries.

[[Banyan]]

CATEGORIES: Trees, Ecology, Moraceae, Epiphytes, National symbols of India, National symbols of Bangladesh

A banyan (or 'banian') is a kind of fig. It usually starts life by growing on another plant as an epiphyte. Its seeds germinate in the cracks and crevices on a host tree, or on other structures like buildings and bridges.

"Banyan" usually means the Indian banyan or Ficus benghalensis. It is the National tree of the Republic of India. and of Bangladesh respectively. However, the term actually includes all figs which share their epiphytic life cycle. They are put in the subgenus Urostigma.  The seeds of banyans are dispersed by fruit-eating birds. The seeds germinate and send down roots towards the ground. These roots may envelop (cover) part of the host tree or building structure, from which they get the casual name of strangler fig.

A number of tropical forest species grow by strangling. There are other examples in the genus Ficus that competes for light. Any Ficus species showing this habit may be termed a strangler fig.

The leaves of the banyan tree are large, leathery, glossy green and elliptical in shape. Like most of the fig-trees, the leaf bud is covered by two large scales. As the leaf develops the scales fall. Young leaves have an attractive reddish tinge.

Older banyan trees have aerial prop roots that grow into thick woody trunks which, with age, can become indistinguishable from the main trunk. Old trees can spread out laterally using these prop roots to cover a wide area.

Like other Fig species (including the common edible fig Ficus carica), banyans have unique fruit structures and are dependent on fig wasps for reproduction.

[[Light clock]]

CATEGORIES: Relativity

The light clock is a simple way of showing a basic feature of Special relativity. A clock is designed to work by bouncing a flash of light off a distant mirror and using its return to trigger another flash of light, meanwhile counting how many flashes have occurred along the way. It is easy to show that people on Earth watching a spaceship fly overhead with such a clock would see it ticking relatively slowly. This effect is called time dilation.

Before we study the light clock, consider another kind of relativity. Imagine that someone is dribbling a basketball in the hold of a large cargo jet. The basketball player is moving in the same direction as the jet airplane. The other people in the plane see him moving a meter or two as he makes one dribble. Between the time the ball bounces the first time and the ball bounces the second time, about one second has passed. But when the first bounce occurred the basketball was over Gibraltar, and when the second bounce occurred the basketball was over the water nearer to Spain. So the basketball has moved 280 meters with respect to Earth. 

Now consider a somewhat similar question of relative motion. This time we are  going to consider what people looking at stars from the North Pole see when a very fast spaceship flies over them. We can use algebra and the Pythagorean theorem to calculate how much time slows on the spaceship. The only other thing we need is the equation that relates distance, d, rate or speed of travel, r, and time, t. The equation is:

d = rt

The speed of light is constant, so we will apply this value to two problems. We will call the speed of light c, as this is the letter scientists usually use to name it.

A clock is made by putting a light output at the bottom of a long pole, a mirror on top of the pole, and an electronic light detector down at the bottom of the pole. The clock is started by briefly closing a switch that sends one blink of light from the bottom of the pole to the top of the pole where it is reflected back to the bottom of the pole. When the light detector at the bottom of the pole sees the blink of light it does two things. It adds one to the counter that is attached to it, and it fires another blink of light up to the mirror. When that blink of light gets back to the bottom, the count changes to two, and another blink of light is set off. Since light travels very rapidly (300,000 kilometers/second), for each second measured by an ordinary clock the light clock will "tick" a very large number of times.  

To make the math easier, we will say that the pole is one half kilometer long. So if we are standing by the light clock that is built next to the big telescope at the North Pole, we will see that light travels one kilometer for each "tick" of the light clock. Since distance traveled, d, equals speed multiplied by time, and the speed involved is c, we have the equation:

d = ct

and we can solve this equation for t to learn how long in seconds each "tick" is.

1 km = 300,000 km/second * t seconds

t seconds = 1 km/300,000 (km/second) = 1/300,000 seconds =  0.00000333…3 seconds

In other words, each "tick" of the light clock will take 0.00000333…3 seconds.

If a spaceship were flying on a straight line passing over the North Pole at a large fraction of the speed of light, and it had a similar clock, people watching its passage would see that the mirror on top of the pole had moved from directly over the emitting light, so the light would travel along the line marked h in the diagram, and then it would follow the other hypotenuse back down to the base of the pole -- which would by now have moved some distance since the spaceship is moving so fast. We can figure out how much time one tick would take according to the people on Earth. We know that the spaceship's pole has a length of a since it is the same kind of clock as people are using at the North Pole. We want to figure out t' , the time it takes to make one tick of the clock on the spaceship.

We know that the spaceship will travel 1/2 r t'  while the blink of light is heading up toward the mirror, and another 1/2 r t'  while the blink of light is heading down toward the base of the pole. So that calculation gives us the length of line b in the chart. We know a, so we can figure out h by the Pythagorean theorem:

h = √(a2 + (rt' /2)2)

So the total distance the light travels is 2 h or d = 2 √(a2 + (rt' /2)2)

We also know that the speed of light, c, is constant. No matter who measures it, it turns out to be the same speed. So we can use that fact to get another way of calculating how long it takes for the flash of light to go from the base to the top of the pole and back again:

t'  = d/c

In other words, d = c t' .

So we can write

c t'  = 2 √(a2 + (rt' /2)2)

or

1/2 c t'  =  √(a2 + (rt' /2)2)

To solve the above equation, we will need to:

Solving the above equation we find that:

t'  = 2a/(c√(1-r2/c2)

The time between ticks on the clock at the North Pole is 2a/c, so we can then write:

t'  = t/√(1-r2/c2)

If t = 1 second, then if the spaceship is traveling at one half the speed of light, t'  = 1.1547 sec.

[[The Narrows]]

CATEGORIES: Staten Island, Straits, Brooklyn

The Narrows is the tidal strait splitting up the New York City boroughs of Staten Island and Brooklyn. It connects the Upper and Lower New York Bay and makes the channel where the Hudson River can empty into the Atlantic Ocean. It is believed that the Narrows were most likely formed after deposition of the Harbor Hill Moraine about 18,000 years ago just before to the end of the last ice age. Staten Island and Brooklyn used to be connected and the Hudson River emptied into the ocean through the Raritan River and taking course through present day northern New Jersey. A build up of water in the Upper Bay allowed the river to break through to form the Narrows less than 12,000 to 13,000 years ago as it exists today.

The first recorded European entrance into the Narrows was in 1524 by Florentine explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano, who set anchor in the strait and was greeted by a group of Lenape in canoes. A 1964 bridge across the Narrows was named for him.

[[Atticus Finch]]

CATEGORIES: Fictional American people, To Kill a Mockingbird

Atticus Finch is a fictional (not real) character in Harper Lee's book To Kill a Mockingbird. Atticus is an American lawyer who lives in Alabama. He is the father of Jeremy Atticus "Jem" Finch and Jean Louise "Scout" Finch. Atticus is an important character in the book.

In To Kill a Mockingbird, Atticus is shown as a good character, trying to live in the way he thinks a lawyer and human being should. He is very honest, thoughtful, and helps good causes (even when he knows that they will fail). He tries hard to teach his children to be kind, fair, and giving. His children later find out that he was an expert at shooting, but had not told them because he did not want them to think he was violent. He is described in the book as a tall, middle-aged man with glasses and hair that is going a little gray.

Alice Petry said that Atticus has "become something of a folk hero in legal circles and is treated almost as if he were an actual person." Examples of Atticus Finch's impact on the legal profession are plentiful. Morris Dees says that Atticus Finch was the reason he became a lawyer, and Richard Matsch said that Atticus influenced him greatly. Some people, however, criticize Atticus, saying that he does not use his legal skills to change the racism in his town.

Born at the Palace of Versailles, Charles was the youngest son of Louis, Dauphin of France, "le Grand Dauphin", and of Maria Anna Victoria of Bavaria. 

The Duchess of Orléans proposed he marry her daughter Marie Louise Élisabeth d'Orléans. All agreed, the marriage with Marie Louise Élisabeth took place on 6 July 1710.

The Nintendo 3DS (also called 3DS or N3DS) is a handheld video game console made by Nintendo which can display 3D effects without the need for any special glasses. It succeeded the Nintendo DS family. Like the Wii, Wii U, Nintendo Switch, and all the members of the Nintendo 3DS family, it has a Mii Maker application, letting the user create their own personal avatar, which some games use to replace the standard characters. It was released in Japan on February 26, 2011, on March 25, 2011 in Europe and the United Kingdom, on March 27, 2011 in the United States and Canada, and in Australia on March 31, 2011. The Nintendo 3DS lets the user play games in either 2D or 3D. A slider lets the player change the level of 3D in the game. The Nintendo 3DS also lets the user play most Nintendo DS and Nintendo DSi games, but only in 2D. Similar to the DSi and DSi XL, DS games that use the Game Boy Advance slot cannot be used. It comes with extra channels (some have to be downloaded from the Nintendo eShop), such as Nintendo Video, Nintendo Zone, and Swapnote. The system has a camera on the inside, and two on the outside. The outer cameras let the user both take pictures in 3D and shoot videos up to 10 minutes long in 3D.

The Nintendo 3DS was first shown at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2010.

On July 28, 2011, Nintendo announced that they would cut the price of the 3DS to $170 on August 12. People who got it when it was at the higher price of $250 got 10 free Nintendo Entertainment System games, along with 10 free Game Boy Advance games from the Nintendo eShop. NES games later became available to the public, but GBA games remained exclusive to ambassadors.

A bigger version, called the Nintendo 3DS XL, was shown to the public on June 21, 2012. Similar to the DSi XL, this version has screens much larger than the regular 3DS. It was released in Japan in July 2012 and August 2012 worldwide (along with New Super Mario Bros. 2), and currently costs $199. A third version of the console, called the Nintendo 2DS, was announced on  August 27, 2013 and released on October 12, 2013 worldwide and in Japan on February 27, 2016. This version does not have the 3D feature and is the first handheld since the Game Boy Micro not to have the clamshell design. Two newer upgraded versions were released, called the New Nintendo 3DS and New Nintendo 3DS XL, similar to the DSi and DSi XL. Like the original 3DS, the New 3DS also has an XL variant. They were announced on August 28, 2014 and released in Japan on October 11, 2014, in Australia on November 21, 2014, and in Europe and North America on February 13, 2015. However, in North America, only the XL version was released at launch. The standard-sized version was released only in special bundles on September 25, 2015. The sixth and latest model called the New Nintendo 2DS XL was announced on April 27, 2017 and released in June/July 2017. Like the Nintendo 2DS, it does not have the 3D feature, but retains the clamshell design and has the same features as the New 3DS and New 3DS XL.

In the first year, Nintendo 3DS sold 15 million units and Nintendo 3DS fans created 213.8 million Miis.

[[Luminiferous aether]]

CATEGORIES: Physics, History of science

Luminiferous aether is a substance once believed to fill the Universe and explain how the transmission of waves of light can happen. People believed that light was a kind of wave. Waves travel over the surface of water in a pond, through the air in a room, etc. All waves that people had studied before had travelled through a medium. The speed of sound through steel is much higher than through air, so people imagined that light must travel through a similar medium too. Since light travels faster than anything else, light should travel through something more rigid (like steel) faster than anything else. But at the same time this substance must have a very low viscosity so that it would not slow down the movements of planets and cause them to eventually fall into their suns. The people coming before Albert Einstein believed this substance to exist, and they called it the "Luminiferous aether." 

If an observer was to travel on a boat moving through an ocean current, then they could observe changes in the rate that waves appeared to travel depending on the relationship of the observer to the current. 

Physicists conducted experiments to attempt to make this question become clear. The Michelson-Morley Experiment showed that there was no medium through which light travelled. It showed that there is no Luminiferous aether.

The easiest way to see the general idea is to imagine a very fast spaceship moving at one half the speed of light from one star to another. The spaceship has two light-speed meters, one pointing backward and one pointing forward. Since the spaceship is moving away from the photons given off by the yellow star, and running toward the photons given off by the blue star, our ordinary experience leads us to expect that we would measure the speed of the yellow photons as 150,000 kilometres per second, and the speed of the blue photons as 450,000 kilometres per second. However both photons are measured at 300,000 km/sec. Thereby this result indicates that speeds do not change relative to the movement of the spaceship.

[[Lorentz contraction]]

CATEGORIES: Relativity

The Lorentz contraction, also called Length contraction, Fitzgerald contraction or Lorenz-Fitzgerald contraction, is the phenomenon that a moving object becomes shorter than it was when measured in its rest frame.  This is because of relativistic effects seen between observers moving toward or away from one another.  The size of one object as seen by someone moving toward or away from it it is decreased along their line of movement by an amount mathematically related to their speed and the speed of light.

In his book, One, Two, Three...Infinity, physicist George Gamow quoted a limerick (a kind of poem) that is said by some to have been changed from a more naughty poem. There are several other cleaned up versions:

There once was a young man named Fisk,

Whose fencing was extremely brisk,

So fast was his action,

The Lorentz contraction,

Foreshortened his foil to a disk.

In Eastern Orthodox Church the Christogram is composed with letters X, P, I and X arranged into the cross. They are the first letters of one from two words in Greek language: Christ and Jesus Christ.

In the Western culture there exist the compositions: "IHS" and also "IHC" being the first letters (iota-eta-sigma) of the name Jesus in Greek alphabet: ΙΗΣΟΥΣ (Ίησοῦς or ΙΗϹΟΥϹ with lunated sigma). The abbreviation in form "IHS" appeared in first time on the coins of Justinian II on the turn of the 7th and 8th centuries.

The order of Jesuits, in other words the Society of Jesus (Societas Iesu), adopted IHS as its fixed emblem - the symbol in 17th century. There appeared also Latin interpretations of the abbreviation IHS, among others:

and also:

These developed inscriptions were most likely formed because in the Middle Ages people mistakenly read the letter E as H. According to whom?

According to a legend, this inscription with the cross was seen by emperor Constantine the Great in his sleep before the battle against Maxentius in 312 on the Ponte Milvio.

Commentators unfriendly to the Catholic Church sometimes interpret the abbreviation IHS as derived from the solar idols of the Egyptian mythology: Isis, Horus and Seth. Nevertheless, present scientific knowledge does not confirm such interpretations.

[[Matchbox]]

CATEGORIES: Containers

A matchbox is a box that contains safety matches. Usually, they are made of wooden sticks or cardboard. Matchboxes commonly have the dimension 5 x 3,5 x 1,5 cm.  Matchbooks have replaced matchboxes for some applications. 

Category:ContainersThe roaring, blinding flames lie undisturbed in an enchanted sleep. The disguised flames lay enclosed and protected in a rectangular enclosure and they wait, like a dying plant desperate for a drop of water, for the moment when they will awaken from their sleep and sizzle to life.

A matchbox is an object we use and see in our everyday life. Therefore we may take its value and importance for granted. But fire is no ordinary discovery. It can perhaps be called ancient mans greatest discovery.

A matchstick is a thin, smooth slice of wood, delicately cut into a rectangular stick. The tip of this stick however, is covered with a charcoal like black substance. This is the resting place of the birth of the flames. These flames will only awaken from their deep slumber when they are scratched along the side of their rectangular enclosure.

The matchstick scratches itself along the side of the matchbox in a swift movement and then all at once, as if by magic, a mesmerizing flam of crimson yellow and blood red appears. The flame is not tame and will not stay obediently at the tip of the matchstick. It slowly and threateningly makes its way down the thin slice of wood until eventually it reaches the end of the stick where it meets its fate. All too soon, the flame disappears as quickly as it appeared, leaving no trace that it ever existed.

In a traditional fairy tale, the sleeping princess is locked away in an eerie and irksome tower of a castle in a land far away from civilization.  In a similar manner the matches are forever locked away in a dismal prison- a cardboard box. This prison can range in all shapes and sizes just like in a fairy tale.  However, no matter what the size, what the shape, its properties are still the same.

The smell of a match box remains a mystery to all for it has to particular smell. The mystery of the fell of the matchsticks has been uncovered. The wooden stick is smooth but the black tip is a sharp contrast for it is rough.

The matchbox has clearly found its place in our lives. Its importance is unimaginable and we are ignorant creatures if we fail to recognize this.

The New York Provincial Congress was an organization that was started by rebels in 1775 during the American Revolution as a replacement for the Province of New York Assembly. It was a replacement for the Committee of One Hundred. There were three provincial congresses until the first Constitutional Convention was founded. The New York Provincial Congress was replaced in 1777.

[[Battle of Fort Washington]]

CATEGORIES: 1776 in New York City, Battles of the American Revolutionary War, History of Manhattan, November events

The Battle of Fort Washington was one of the early battles fought in the American Revolutionary War between the United States and Great Britain. It took place on 16 November 1776. The British won the battle.

After winning against the Continental Army (commanded by George Washington), the British army (commanded by William Howe) wanted to capture Fort Washington, the last American stronghold in Manhattan. Washington had thought of leaving the Fort and moving its military camp of 1400 men to New Jersey, but had been convinced by General Nathaniel Greene to fight for it. The garrison was expanded to 3,000 men.

On 16 November, Howe attacked the fort. The assault came from three different directions: the north, east and south. The attack was put off for a short time because of the tides in the Harlem River that stopped some of the troops from landing. When the attack did begin, the southern and western American defenses fell quickly. In the North there was better defense against the attack, but they eventually weakened as well. With the fort surrounded by land and sea the Fort's commander, Robert Magaw, chose to surrender the fort rather than try to hold out. A total of 59 Americans were killed and 2,837 became prisoners of the British. After this defeat the main American army under George Washington was chased across New Jersey and into Pennsylvania, setting the stage for the battles of Trenton and Princeton.

[[Great Fire of New York (1776)]]

CATEGORIES: 1776 in New York City, American Revolutionary War, Fires in the United States, History of Manhattan

The Great Fire of New York was a large fire in New York City. It burned through the night of September 21, 1776 on the west side of the former boundaries of New York City at the southern end of the island of Manhattan.  It started when the British Army took control of the city during the American Revolutionary War.

The fire destroyed 10 to 25% of the city. Some of the unburned parts of the city were ransacked.  Many people thought that someone started the fire on purpose, for different reasons.  British leaders accused American rebels, who had recently lost the Battle of Long Island, of starting the fire. Most people thought that one side or the other had started it.

Ferenc Fricsay (born Budapest, 9 August 1914; died Basel, 20 February 1963) (pronounced "Ferr-'ens 'Frich-sye") was a Hungarian conductor. From 1960 until his death, he was an Austrian citizen.

Fricsay was born in Budapest in 1914.  His music teachers were Hungary's most famous composers:  Béla Bartók, Zoltán Kodály and Ernst von Dohnányi.  He was only 15 when he conducted his first concert, and he soon became very famous.  He became music director of the then newly formed RIAS Symphony Orchestra in Germany in 1949. He was conductor of the Houston Symphony in 1954. He spent much of his time from the 1950s onward in Germany as conductor of the Bavarian State Opera (1956–1958), the RIAS Symphony Orchestra, the Deutsche Oper Berlin and the Berlin Philharmonic.

From the 1950s until his death, he recorded for the Deutsche Grammophon record label. Fricsay gave his last concert on 7 December 1961 in London where he conducted the London Philharmonic Orchestra in Beethoven's Symphony No. 7.  He was often ill during his life, and he died of stomach cancer on 20 February 1963 at the age of 48 in Basel, Switzerland.

Fricsay was known for his interpretations of the music of Mozart and Beethoven, as well as that of his teacher Béla Bartók. His 1958 recording of Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 is featured in the movie A Clockwork Orange.

Many musicians still think his recordings are among the very best.

[[Irmgard Seefried]]

CATEGORIES: 1919 births, 1988 deaths, German singers, Sopranos, German opera singers

Irmgard Seefried (born Köngetried, Bavaria, 9 October 1919; died Vienna, 24 November 1988) was a famous German soprano who sang opera and lieder.

Irmgard Seefried was born in Köngetried, near Mindelheim, Bavaria, Germany.  She studied at Augsburg University.  Her first appearance in opera was in Aachen where she sang the role of the priestess in Verdi's Aida in 1940. She soon began to sing leading parts, and in 1943 she sang the part of Eva in Wagner's Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg at the Vienna State Opera conducted by Karl Böhm. Since then, she belonged to the ensemble of the Vienna State Opera until she retired in 1976.

She sang at the Salzburg Festival nearly every year and gave many recitals.  She appeared at the Royal Opera House of Covent Garden in London from 1947 to 1949, and also La Scala in Milan, Edinburgh Festival, etc. She sang at the  Metropolitan Opera in New York  during the 1953 -a1954 season the role of Susanna in Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro

She is especially remembered for her singing of the music of Mozart and Richard Strauss, but she also sang in other composers' operas; the title role in Puccini's Madama Butterfly, Marie in Alban Berg's Wozzeck, Eva in Der Meistersinger von Nürnberg, Blanche in Poulenc's Dialogues des Carmélites, and the title role in Janáček's Káťa Kabanová. She was a great lieder singer and several of her Salzburg Festival recitals were recorded.  She left many recordings of oratorio and sacred music by Bach, Mozart, Haydn (including at least four different performances of the Angel Gabriel in Die Schöpfung), Brahms, Fauré, Beethoven, Dvořák, and Stravinsky.

Although she was a high soprano, she performed, and recorded, both the trousers roles of the Composer in Strauss's  Ariadne auf Naxos and Octavian in Der Rosenkavalier.

She often sang with Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, who said in an interview that Seefried could do easily some things which other singers struggled all their lives to do.  

She was married to the Austrian violinist Wolfgang Schneiderhan from 1948 until her death. 

After retirement, she taught students at Vienna Music Academy and Salzburg Mozarteum. She died aged 69 in Vienna in 1988.

[[Mica]]

CATEGORIES: Minerals

The mica group of minerals are aluminosilicates with various metals. They split into fine sheets, which puts them in the phyllosilicate group of silicate minerals.

Mica includes several closely related materials having perfect basal cleavage. 

All are monoclinic which means their crystals are shaped like one kind of prism. They tend towards pseudo-hexagonal crystals and are similar in chemical composition. The highly perfect cleavage, which is the most prominent characteristic of mica, is explained by the hexagonal sheet-like arrangement of its atoms.

Being excellent electrical insulators, they are used in electronic equipment including capacitors.

[[Talc]]

CATEGORIES: Minerals

Talc (from the Arabic talk) is a silicate mineral, a type of clay. It is the standard for grade 1 in the Mohs scale of mineral hardness. A fingernail can easily scratch it. Talc is composed of hydrated magnesium silicate with the chemical formula Mg3Si4O10(OH)2. Talc and pyrophyllite are very similar, but pyrophyllite may be slightly harder.

Talc has a greasy feel and a translucent, soapy look. In loose form, it is the widely-used substance known as talcum powder. Steatite, also called soapstone, is a rock with a lot of talc.

François Duvalier (14 April 1907 - 21 April 1971), known as "Papa Doc" because he was once a doctor, was the President (dictator) and Head of State of Haiti from 1957 until his death. He was excommunicated from the Catholic Church for expelling foreign-born bishops. 

Like many rulers of Haiti, he was called "President for Life".  His widow was Simone Duvalier.  When he died their son, Jean-Claude Duvalier, called "Baby Doc", became President.

He was born and died at Port-au-Prince, Haiti. He died of diabetes and heart disease.  

[[Kratos]]

CATEGORIES: Greek gods and goddesses

Kratos is a minor Ancient Greek god or demon. His name comes from the Greek word for "power" or "strength". He was a guardian of the throne of Zeus. Kratos was the second son of Zeus  and also the brother of Nike, Zelus, and Bia. He was one of the few people who dragged Prometheus to the rock where he was chained. His name is used as part of other words about power, including democracy, theocracy, plutocracy, aristocracy and dictator.

This Kratos is not to be confused with the protagonist of the video game franchise "God of War." That Kratos is a Spartan warrior and son of Zeus, who is enslaved by Ares, the Greek God of War. Over the course of the original God of War game, Kratos escapes bondage and becomes the new God of War by slaying Ares. However, that title is stripped from Kratos by Zeus at the beginning of God of War II.

[[Charophyceae]]

CATEGORIES: Algae

The Charophyceae are the green algae closest to plants.

Their exact rank is the matter of some debate. Some botanists recommend expanding the existing plant kingdom to include charophyceans and chlorophytes.

Others classify Charophyceae as a class under division Charophyta, with Chlorophyta remaining a distinct division. There are also other possibilities.

The consensus among botanists is that charophyceans are the organisms most closely related to land plants (embryophytes).

Many of the complex plant traits related to sexual reproduction evolved first in charophyceans.cn Analysis of cpDNA (chloroplast DNA) shows that characteristics of plant chloroplasts also evolved first in the charophyceans, before the Zygnematales diverged from the lineage that lead to Coleochaetales, Charales, and the land plants.

Groups generally included within the Charophyceae are:

[[Proactivity]]

CATEGORIES: Words, Cognition

In behavioural psychology, proactivity is thinking ahead. It means doing things before they are needed. It also means preventing something before it happens. It means the same thing as anticipation.

The term is often used in organizational behaviour. Proactive behaviour by individuals anticipates situations in the workplace. It means acting in advance of a situation, rather than just reacting afterwards. Proactive employees usually do not need to be asked to do something. They also do not need detailed instructions. Reactive employees are often controlled by the situation around them. In an unfamiliar situation they need instructions.

[[Chlorophyta]]

CATEGORIES: Algae

Chlorophyta are a division of green algae.

It includes about 7,000 species of mostly aquatic photosynthetic eukaryote organisms.

Like the land plants, green algae contain chlorophylls a and b, and store food as starch in their plastids. Most species are flagellate in at least one stage of their life cycle.

They are related to the Charophyceae (also called Charophyta) and land plants, together making up the Viridiplantae.

The division contains both unicellular and multicellular species. While most species live in freshwater habitats and a large number in marine habitats, other species are adapted to a wide range of environments. Watermelon snow, or Chlamydomonas nivalis, lives on summer alpine snowfields. Others live attached to rocks or woody parts of trees. Some lichens are symbiotic relationships between fungi and green algae.

Members of the Chlorophyta also form symbiotic relationships with protozoa, sponges and cnidarians. Some conduct sexual reproduction.

[[Extremism]]

CATEGORIES: Politics

Political views and ideas which are far from the  mainstream are called extremist. Such views often violate common moral standards. As an example, a group that wants to replace a democratic form of government with a totalitarian one is almost always considered extremist. Political or religious fundamentalism as well as fanaticism can  also be seen as extremist.

What is seen as extremist varies by country. People who support that Muslim women should wear a burqa may be seen as extremist in France, but such an opinion may not be extremist in Afghanistan or Saudi Arabia.

Children's Pastoral is a Catholic church based organization which teaches mother basic health care skills. It has saved the lives of thousands of babies in Brazil.

She was born in the south of Brazil to German parents. She studied medicine at university and then set up clinics in Curitiba. She soon saw that much of the sickness, such as diarrhoea and dehydration could be prevented if parents knew how to care properly for their children. In 1983, her brother, Paulo Evaristo Arns, a bishop in the Catholic Church encouraged her to set up Children's Pastoral. It is now in 42,000 Brazilian communities, and has over 260,000 trained volunteers.

In 2007, Arns was given the Woodrow Wilson Award for Public service.

Arns was killed in the 2010 Haiti earthquake while speaking to a church group. She had gone there on a visit to a missionary organization helping with the care of babies.

[[Transphobia]]

CATEGORIES: Discrimination, Transgender

Transphobia is any prejudice or discrimination based on bad feelings toward transgender or transsexual people. This also means refusing them the chance to take part in society, have a job, or forcing prostitution out of them, not only hate speech or hate crime against the transgender person. In 2009, to prohibit hate crime against transgender people, Matthew Shepard Act was passed and entered into force by recognition of the president Barack Obama in the United States.

The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees point out the asylum seekers because of gender identity together with the Yogyakarta Principles. But a transgender woman who has escaped from Guatemala to Denmark has been put into a male centre and raped there. Now she is in danger to be returned into Guatemala by Danish government.

Transphobia is common all over the world. It is also found in social justice movements such as feminism. It is especially associated with radical feminism. 'Transmisogyny' is a word that refers to transphobia towards trans women. Julia Serano made it popular with her book Whipping Girl. Cissexism is sometimes used as a synonym for transphobia, and cisphobia is sometimes used as its antonym.

[[Viridiplantae]]

CATEGORIES: Plant taxonomy

Viridiplantae ('green plants') are the clade which includes the green algae and land plants.

In some classification systems they have been called Plantae, by expanding the traditional plant kingdom (Embryophytes) to include the green algae.

Adl and colleagues, who produced a classification for eukaryotes in 2005, used the name Chloroplastida for this group, reflecting the group having primary chloroplasts with green chlorophyll. They rejected the name Viridiplantae on the grounds that most of the species are not plants, as understood traditionally.

There are more than 350,000 species of Viridiplantae.

[[Natural rights]]

CATEGORIES: Rights

Natural rights are rights that believe it is important for all humans and animals to have out of (natural law.)  These rights are often viewed as inalienable, meaning they can almost never be taken away. The concept of what are natural rights has varied throughout history.  the Americans thought the British were being very unfair. So they created the natural law and the declaration of independence. Then after the declaration was written they created the united states and became a country.The idea first came up in ancient times but was discussed most famously by English philosopher John Locke in the 1600's.  Locke said that the most important natural rights are "Life, Liberty, and Property". In the United States Declaration of Independence, the natural rights mentioned are "Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness".  The idea was also found in the Declaration of the Rights of Man. It is viewed by Locke, Jefferson, and others that the purpose of government is to protect peoples' natural rights through a social contract (an implicit agreement among the members of a society to cooperate for social benefits). There have been many times in history that natural rights have been breached by both governments and singular people.

In some traditions, the Chimera was one of the offspring of Typhon and Echidna and sister of such monsters as Cerberus and the Lernaean Hydra. However, the chimera does not appear to have an existence in physical reality, save for the individual animals from which it is composed.

His father was a Lutheran minister, but Bjørnson rejected organized religion. He married Karoline Reimers, a famous stage actress, and their son Bjørn also had great success as a stage actor, and appeared in a few early silent films. Their daughter, Bergljot, married Henrik Ibsen's son Sigurd.

He attended grammar school, Heltbergs Studentfabrikk in Oslo, with Henrik Ibsen, but dropped out of a course at the University of Oslo. By his early twenties he was writing literature reviews for the Norwegian newspaper, Morgenbladet. At 25 he wrote his first produced play, Mellem Slagene (Between the Battles). His Paul Lange og Tora Parsberg was a statement for political tolerance, and På Guds veie ("In God's Way") for religious tolerance. He is best known internationally for his tales of peasant life in Norway. His novel, Synnöve Solbakken, has been filmed three times. Bjørnson also worked as a stage director, and later served as editor of another paper, Aftenbladet, where he wrote fiery liberal editorials and passionately defended Alfred Dreyfus. His poem, "Yes, We Love This Land", is the Norwegian national anthem.

The cause of his death is unknown.

Fontainebleau is a sub-prefecture of the Seine-et-Marne department. It is the seat of the Arrondissement of Fontainebleau. The commune has the largest land area in the Île-de-France region. It is the only one to cover a larger area than Paris itself.

Fontainebleau, together with the neighbouring commune of Avon, Seine-et-Marne and three other smaller communes, form an urban area of 36,713 people (according to the 1999 census). This urban area is a satellite of Paris.

Fontainebleau is known for the large and scenic Forest of Fontainebleau, a favourite weekend getaway for Parisians. It is also known for the historical Palace of Fontainebleau, which once belonged to the kings of France.

[[Mudrock]]

CATEGORIES: Sedimentary rocks

Mudrocks make up most of the sedimentary rocks on Earth. They are a class of fine grained siliciclastic sedimentary rocks.

The types of mudrocks include: siltstone, claystone, mudstone, slate, and shale.

Most of the particles are less than 0.0625 mm (1/16th mm or 0.0025 inches) and are too small to study readily in the field. At first sight the rock types look quite similar; however, there are important differences in composition and naming.

There has been a great deal of disagreement about the classification of mudrocks. There are some reasons for this:

Mudrocks make up half of the sedimentary rocks in the geologic record, and are easily the most widespread deposits on Earth. Fine sediment is the most abundant product of erosion, which is why mudrocks are so common.

With increased pressure over time the platey clay minerals may become aligned, with the appearance of parallel layering (fissility). This finely bedded material which splits readily into thin layers is called shale, as distinct from mudstone.

From the beginning of civilization, when pottery and mudbricks were made by hand, to now, mudrocks have been important. The first book on mudrocks was not published until 1964. However, scientists, engineers, and oil producers have understood the significance of mudrocks since the discovery of the Burgess Shale and the relatedness of mudrocks and oil.

[[Siltstone]]

CATEGORIES: Sedimentary rocks

A siltstone is a mudrock. For a rock to be a siltstone, it must be over fifty percent silt-sized material.

Silt is any particle smaller than sand, 1/16th of a millimeter (~0.06 mm), and larger than clay, 1/256th (~0.004 mm) of millimeter. Silt is the product of physical weathering, such as freezing and thawing. Physical weathering does not involve any chemical changes in the rock, just its physical breaking apart.

One of the highest proportions of silt found on Earth is in the Himalayas, which get rainfall of up to five to ten meters (16 to 33 feet) a year. Quartz and feldspar are the biggest contributors to silt. Silt tends to be non-cohesive, non-plastic, but can liquefy easily.

There is a simple field test to judge whether a rock is a siltstone or not, and that is to put the rock to one's teeth. If the rock feels "gritty" against one's teeth, than it is a siltstone.

[[Maria Mitchell]]

CATEGORIES: American astronomers, Scientists from Massachusetts, 1818 births, 1889 deaths

Maria Mitchell (1818–1889) was one of the first female astronomers. She was born in Nantucket, Massachusetts. She attended a local girls school. Later, Mitchell attended a school run by her father. Mitchell opened her own school when she was 17. Her school had many programs. These programs allowed students to birdwatch. They also allowed students to observe astronomy.

Mitchell’s love for astronomy started when her father began keeping a small observatory. She began to observe space and notice things. The accomplishment that made Mitchell famous was when she discovered a comet in October 1847. The comet was later known as Miss Mitchell's comet, and is now called C/1847 T1. She received a medal from the king of Denmark after discovering the comet.

Mitchell also helped make accurate calculations of time, latitude, and longitude. Mitchell became the first woman elected to join the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the year after. In 1850, she joined the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Afterward, she became professor of astronomy at Vassar College in 1865. She stayed there until she retired in 1888. Mitchell died one year later at age 71.

After Mitchell’s death, she was recognized as a great astronomer. In 1905, she was elected into the Hall of Fame for Great Americans.

[[Mudstone]]

CATEGORIES: Sedimentary rocks

A mudstone is a siliciclastic sedimentary rock which has a mixture of silt- and clay-sized particles (at least 1/3 of each). So, a mudstone is a type of mudrock with a more varied grain size than either siltstones or claystones.

Alternatively, some sources say it is a synonym for mudrock.

[[Lactose intolerance]]

CATEGORIES: Health problems, Biochemistry, Classical genetics, Evolutionary biology

Lactose intolerance is when a person cannot digest milk or milk products (such as cheese or yogurt). All mammals start off on mother's milk, and almost all change to a non-milk diet, a process we call weaning.

Lactose is a disaccharide sugar (double sugar molecule). To be digested it must be split (digested) into two simple sugars (monosaccharides), glucose and galactose. 

An enzyme called lactase is needed to break it down. People with lactose intolerance do not have this enzyme or make only small quantities. Because of this they are unable to digest lactose.

Up to 75% of people worldwide begin to lose the ability to digest lactose as they grow into adults. This loss of ability ranges from 5% in northern Europe, to over 71% in Sicily and to over 90% in parts of Africa and Asia. There is no cure for lactose intolerance. Those people need to change their diet to eat and drink substances with very little lactose. There are many milk substitutes. 

Milk is not a fermented product. If is not digested, then it may ferment in the small intestine which can cause a problem called pseudoallergy. Amino acids are changed to other substances, which may act in much the same way as histamine in a true allergy.

Lactose intolerance is not the same as milk allergy, which is an immune reaction to some of the proteins in milk.

[[Sterile neutrino]]

CATEGORIES: Subatomic particles

Sterile neutrinos, also known as neutral heavy leptons, heavy neutrinos, or right-handed neutrinos, are theoretical particles that are extremely difficult to find. This is because they are not affected by all of fundamental forces that rule normal physics, only gravity. They are detected by a theory called the seesaw mechanism which says that when sterile neutrinos are near other neutrinos (tiny particles which are not affected by much), they increase their own mass by lowering the mass of the nearby neutrinos. Detection probably comes from the fact that they are affected by gravity.

Think of it as a particle that absorbs the energy of other particles of the same family type. Once one is near another of its family, it raises its mass by lowering (absorbing) another's overall mass.

[[Burn (injury)]]

CATEGORIES: Medical emergencies

A burn is an injury to a person's skin or even flesh. Heat, cold, electricity, chemicals, friction, or radiation can be the cause of a burn. Most burns are due to heat from hot liquids, solids, or fire. While rates are similar for males and females the underlying causes often differ. Among women in some areas, risk is related to use of open cooking fires or unsafe stoves. Among men, risk is related to the work environments. Alcoholism and smoking are other risk factors. Burns can also occur as a result of self harm or violence between people.

Burns can be very serious injuries, and in some cases can even cause death. Depending on how deep the burn goes and amount of skin affected, a burn can be a medical emergency. For children, at least five percent of the skin needs to be affected.  Adults can tolerate up to ten percent of affected skin.

Burns of a certain extent affect the body as a whole: Common reactions are circulatory shock, systemic inflammatory response syndrome and sepsis.

[[Unconformity]]

CATEGORIES: Stratigraphy

An unconformity is a gap in the sequence of rocks in a geologic column. It is a buried erosion surface separating two rock strata of different ages. It shows that sediment deposition was broken for a time, usually because the land was above sea level at that time. 

Usually, the older layer was exposed to erosion for some time before deposition of the younger. However, the term is used to describe any break in the sedimentary record.

Many millions of years may separate the rocks above and below the discontinuity.  

James Hutton found examples of unconformity in Scotland, at Jedburgh in 1787 and at Siccar Point in 1788.

The rocks above an unconformity are younger than the rocks beneath (unless the sequence has been overturned). An unconformity represents time during which no sediments were preserved in the region. 

The local record for that time interval is missing and geologists must use other clues to discover that part of the geologic history of that area. The interval of geologic time not represented is called a hiatus (= 'gap').
